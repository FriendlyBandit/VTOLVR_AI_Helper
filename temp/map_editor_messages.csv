Notice all radars are available when configuring the SAM launcher, even if it does not populate on the checklist. This is most evident when toggling between ALL or NONE. It seems that the options available for the previously configured radar, are carried over. 4) Switch back to a Red SAM and note that all radars are available as above.  So order or faction doesn't matter. The behavior goes away when reloading the file. As long as you edit BOTH factions SAMs within the same session, you'll end up with universally mixing both lists of radars. As for in game behavrior, the glitched configurations sucessfully save to file. However, the launchers don't seem to be taking orders from the wrong faction.

What it should be though is ""extend pixel and flatten"" so if you have water on one side, it extends to just water, and land on the opposite continues land. Versus the option of... either it's ALL water, or ALL land on the edge.... and then after you hit that border; it just becomes water anyways.  To be honest, I have no clue what I'm doing, I literally am surprised nobody has worked on a Caucasus for VTOLVR, but couldn't find anything.  If anyone has any interest that has a clue what they're doing and wants to assist me and make it better than someone that's learning, would be awesome lol. For me it's just an annoyance that there's little / no information about how the map editor works really, so diving in blind so far has been... tough.  I still want to tweak my heightmap, it looks half decent.  That said, it will always be a scale version of that area; or it would be a very small area.  For reference, Stavropol (north DCS Caucasus) to Batumi (nearish south Caucasus), is 380 kilometers, which already HUGELY exceeds the limits","","üòé (1)"

Unfortunately the tangram heightmap is a bit wonky in that area so i have a lot of manual touching up to do but its coming along slowly.  I have 1 main question (ill attach some screenshots below): How should I approach the borders of my map? It just abruptly cuts off in the corner. Obviously the crimean peninsula extends north to ukraine and east to russia. I was thinking I just need to manually draw the terrain out to the north and the east (even tho it will be outside the borders of the map). This isnt as easy as a landlocked map or an island map so i am just probing for ideas to keep the immersion in game by not having any map cutoff...  2nd question: Am I going too hard with the city paint (see below) I noticed it takes a hit in performance; I have some pretty beefy specs and just want to make sure a city of my size on the map will allow everyone to enjoy, not just me.","",""

I bought mine in Oct'19 specifically to go flying .... tried FSX with Fly Inside - had already spent months with FSX a decade ago. Couldn't get it to work. Then tried VTOL VR, and haven't looked back - don't think I could go HOTAS anymore.   I first started up Oil Rig about 4 weeks ago and thought wow isn't this a beautiful place,  the city, the mountains, water straight, suburbs along the water straight, bridge across the straight. All seemed so ... can't say realistic; but was so representative of real life. It was early morning, and flying along the straight to oil rig was fun, in the morning sun, flying a plane - just great. I was impressed - you did well with that map. You can set up free flying and I'd appreciate that, but can you share the map itself.

It should be a 196 sq km map centered on this point: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mach+Loop/@52.7049316,-3.8551732,13025m/  I wrote a script to automatically generate a heightmap from Bing's Terrain data and a world ""build up"" survey to generate ""accurately"" placed villages and cities. Cities/Villeges are a bit blocky because the resolution of the data I'm using is 1km. Lakes and stuff like that are kinda ifffy... The scaling might *also* be a bit iffy, but it should be close enough to work from at least to make it interesting. If my math is correct, I believe its a resolution of about 375 meters per pixel.  City density is very very painful to load still in the game apparently, so I've cranked it down a bit. Load times are still a bit long. Not sure if @BahamutoD has any tips on this, other than just not including as many cities. I need to work on that aspect of it I guess. I can pretty easily zoom in, but I thought having that channel/ocean there would be pretty interesting.

"273150873927024640","Kili#0785","01/11/2022 7:08 AM","I have now tested a bit. Depending on which size you select, the heightmap is interpreted differently. If you select the largest map value, it seems as if the height map in x (width) and y (length) direction is pulled apart. That means, depending on which size you select as map, the mountains (the highest values on the height map) become smaller in height (for large map sizes) or larger in height (for small map sizes) **[The gif shows approximately how the map size distorts the height map]**. Now I thought I just make the resolution of the heightmap image higher but it also stretches the map in x and y direction.  So I have the following questions(I think only a developer can answer them for me. But I'll ask here before I write an email, maybe I have a wrong understanding of heightmaps):  At which map size will the heightmap be interpreted 1:1 without being scaled in x and y? Why is only scaled in x and y and not also in z direction?  Will the map creation via heightmap be adjusted again in the future? E.g. that for a certain map size an optimal image resolution is displayed?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547123804850225176/930448058544689152/Y8PrZXFdiv.gif",""
