1.1 - OVERVIEW


In this manual, you will find instructions to help pilot the AH-94 Dragonfly in a modern combat theater. Begin by reading the aircraft overview and rotary basics. This manual contains a plethora of information intended to aid workflow in the cockpit. See References (Pg.65)




1.2 - AIRCRAFT OVERVIEW


The Bell AH-94 Dragonfly is a Land and Sea based attack helicopter based on the Bell 360 Invictus prototype selected as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA). The Dragonfly's purpose was to combine the reconnaissance capabilities and flight characteristics of the OH-58 Kiowa, with the armament and sensor suite of an AH-64 Apache, ultimately replacing both aircraft by 2050. The Dragonfly features a new radar, The AN/APG-108 FCR, a Modernised-TADS, reduced Radar Cross Section, an enclosed tail rotor, and stowable landing gear. The aircraft also pioneers a Rotary based, all-in-one, situational awareness, navigation, and Datalink display, the Integrated Navigation Display.
The Dragonfly is fitted with 4 under-wing hardpoints, 2 wing-tip hardpoints, mast-mounted fire control radar, and a chin-mounted gimbal hardpoint  for mounting either a 20mm Rotary Cannon or 30mm Chaingun, totaling 8 hardpoints. The M-TADS, Modernised Target Acquisition and Designation Sight is mounted externally without the use of a hardpoint. Fuel capacity is 1915 Pounds but can be expanded to 2400 Pounds with external fuel tanks.

1.2.1
Rotary Aircraft Basics


First, let's understand how the AH-94, and many other Rotorcraft, generate lift and sustain stable flight. 
        The AH-94 is powered by 2 LHTEC T800-LHT-801 Turboshaft Engines which create 1,563hp (1,166kW) each. Both engines output this power through a transmission connected to the rotor mast with a clutch similar to an automobile. Both Pilot and Co-Pilot Gunner have a Collective, Cyclic, and Rudder Pedals; these controls are similar to a Fixed-Wing Aircraft with some key differences.


Collective:
In a Fixed-Wing Aircraft,the throttle controls fuel flow, this has a direct impact on engine RPM and thrust output.
A Collective does not adjust engine fuel flow, instead it increases/decreases Rotor Blade Pitch Angle. This creates a difference in air flow moving through the rotor system resulting in a change in thrust (dependent on altitude). The Engine and Rotor are interlinked via a transmission comparable to a standard automobile transmission. Engines on a Rotorcraft attempt to run at 100% RPM in flight. Drivetrain shock can cause a rapid loss of Rotor RPM and damage to the rotorcraft drivetrain. It is the PIC responsibility to maintain Rotor RPM 100% ±10% and Torque below 100%.


Cyclic:
The Cyclic in a Rotary Aircraft is similar to that of a Fixed-Wing Aircraft in that they both make adjustments to aircraft control surfaces to control Pitch and Roll (Y and Z Axis). Where a Rotary Aircraft differs is that the control surfaces and lift generating surfaces are one surface, the rotor. The Cyclic input is converted into small pitch angle adjustments in the rotor system, directing the downward column of air in the opposite direction of intended travel. 


Anti-Torque Pedals:
The Rudder in Fixed-Wing is different from a Rotary Aircraft when it comes to controlling Yaw (X-Axis). While Fixed-Wing Aircraft use Vertical Stabilizers to control Yaw, Rotorcraft use either a conventional Anti-Torque Tail Rotor, or Contra-Rotating Dual Rotor Design to mitigate undesired rotation caused by torque on the X-Axis.
Torque created by the Main Rotor System must be counteracted to maintain stable flight below or above ETL speeds. Increasing or decreasing the RPM of the Anti-Torque Rotor via Anti-Torque Pedal input counteracts the torque created by the main rotor system resulting in Yaw Control.


________________




ETL/GE/RBS/Dissymmetry of Lift/Gyroscopic Precession/Transverse Flow Effect:


Gyroscopic precession, or Phase Lag, is a phenomenon occurring in rotating bodies in which an applied force is manifested 90 degrees later in the direction of rotation from where the force was applied.


Dissymmetry of Lift refers to an unequal amount of lift on opposite sides of the rotor disc. It is a phenomenon that affects single-rotor helicopters in forward flight. A rotor blade that is moving in the same direction as the aircraft is called the advancing blade and the blade moving in the opposite direction is called the retreating blade. When viewed from above, most American helicopter rotors turn counter-clockwise; French and Russian helicopters turn clockwise. Balancing lift across the rotor disc is important to a helicopter's stability. The amount of lift generated by an airfoil is proportional to the square of its airspeed (velocity). In a hover, the rotor blades have equal airspeeds and therefore equal lift. However, in forward flight the advancing blade has a higher airspeed than the retreating blade, creating uneven lift across the rotor disc.
 
Retreating Blade Stall is a hazardous flight condition in helicopters and other rotary wing aircraft, where the retreating rotor blade has a lower relative blade speed, combined with an increased angle of attack, causing a stall and loss of lift. Retreating Blade Stall is the primary limiting factor of a helicopter's never exceed speed, vNE.
Retreating Blade Stall occurs at high forward speeds, and should not be confused with rotor stall, which is caused by low rotor RPM and can occur at any forward speed. The result is that the retreating blade stalls and the rotorcraft rolls to the side.


Transverse Flow Effect is an aerodynamic effect encountered when a helicopter moves horizontally (typically forward) through the air, which causes the rotor disc to roll to the side. It is also known as transverse roll or inflow roll. Around the same time as the rotorcraft is transitioning into ETL, it experiences oscillations caused by Transverse Flow. This is sometimes referred to as "The Shudder"
Transverse flow effect is not experienced when hovering, because the air above the rotor disc is being pulled down from above (known as induced flow or downwash), and is equally distributed around the rotor disc. The air is descending from above, which has the effect of reducing angle of attack.
However, when the helicopter starts moving into undisturbed air, a portion of the disc is in clean, unaccelerated air, while the remaining portion of the rotor disc is still working on descending air. The part of the disc working on clean air therefore sees a higher angle of attack than the portion of the disc which is working on descending air. The result is that the portion in clean air develops more lift.
The disc rolls to the side, rather than pitching backwards as one might naively expect, because of gyroscopic precession.




Effective Translational Lift or ETL is the airspeed at which a Rotary Aircraft's Rotor System becomes more efficient due to forward translational movement. This effectively determines whether a Rotary Aircraft is in a hover or forward flight and describes the short transitional time between those states.


Ground Effect is the phenomenon where an aircraft creating downward thrust close to a fixed surface will reduce drag on the lift generating surface. For fixed-wing aircraft, ground effect is the reduced aerodynamic drag that an aircraft's wings generate when they are close to a fixed surface. For rotorcraft, ground effect results in less drag on the rotor during hovering close to the ground. There are limitations for hovering a helicopter in ground effect (IGE) and out of ground effect (OGE). Hovering IGE reflects air off of the ground and upwards, back into the rotor system. This requires an increase in collective input, creating a cushion of air beneath the aircraft before landing. This is called fall-through, happening at the transition between OGE and IGE. Ground Effect Transition Altitude can vary from 50ft AGL to 60ft AGL depending on aircraft performance.


Understanding Gyroscopic Precession, Dissymmetry of Lift, the transition between IGE/OGE, Effective Translational Lift, Transverse Flow Effect, Retreating Blade Stall, the relationship between the Rotor System, Drivetrain, control surfaces, and resulting air flow are key to operating any Rotary Aircraft.

________________
Types of Terrain Flight:
Terrain Flight is the practice of avoiding large terrain features and exploiting radar coverage blind-spots in a hostile airspace environment.
There are 3 Airspaces Rotorcraft Pilots reference when flying; Nap of the Earth Flight, Contour Flight, and Low-Level Flight. 


Nap of the Earth or NOE flight refers to flight less than 25ft above ground obstacles and is used by aircraft to avoid enemy detection and attack in a high-threat environment.


Contour Flight refers to 25ft - 80ft above ground obstacles and can be utilized in medium-threat environments allowing for more visibility and more specific energy.


Low-Level Flight operating range is from 80ft - 200ft above ground obstacles.
The largest determining factor when considering terrain flight options is the capability of the enemy. Other factors to consider are the time of day, terrain features, and airspeed.


Permissive/Non-Permissive:
Low Intensity Threat (Also COIN):
A Low Intensity Threat Environment (LITE) is defined as an operating environment containing only Short Range Air Defenses 
(AAA, Armor, Infantry, Patrol Boat)


Medium Intensity Threat:
A Medium Intensity Threat Environment (MITE) is defined as an operating environment containing Medium and Short Range Air Defenses and/or Enemy Ground Attack Aircraft
(AAA, Armor, Infantry, Patrol Boat)
(IRAPC, GAV-25, MANPADS) 


High Intensity Threat:
A High Intensity Threat Environment (HITE) is defined as an operating environment containing Long, Medium, and Short Range Air Defenses in a Combined Air Defense Network and/or Enemy Air Superiority/Ground Attack Aircraft
( AAA, Armor, Infantry, Patrol Boat)
(IRAPC, SAAW, GAV-25, MANPADS)
(MAD-4, SA/FCR SAM, SAAW, ASF, Warships)

________________


DESCRIPTION:
The Modernised Target Acquisition & Designation Sight is an advanced precision targeting system currently in use with AH-64E. The TADS is instrumental in the employment of many air-to-ground precision guided munitions, being necessary for use of optically-guided and laser-guided weapons. The TADS contains a high-resolution, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor that displays an infrared image of the target to the pilot. The TADS has 4 zoom levels, allowing it to be effectively used as both a targeting and reconnaissance system. The TADS also contains a CCD camera used to obtain target imagery in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The TADS is equipped with a linear motion compensator and laser designator for precise delivery of laser-guided munitions and an infrared lasing for flight and target coordination at night. The guidance laser is always on, but the marking laser can be toggled on/off. A laser rangefinder provides accurate ranging information up to 23NM. The TADS is POINT and AREA stabilized, simplifying target acquisition and weapons employment. The TADS can be locked at ranges up to 23NM, however it is possible to observe with limited resolution for an additional 5NM.

3 - Weapons Employment


3.0.1 - WEAPONS ARMING
Before any weapons can be fired, they must be armed. This feature is nothing new, being standard in military aircraft for decades. In the AH-94, there are 2 ways to arm weapons. 
      * The first is the MASTER ARM button. The MASTER ARM button is a momentary switch that when activated, will arm all equipped weapons. 
      * The second way is through the MPD EQUIP page. First Master Arm the rotorcraft. Then by switching the mark mode to ARM (RX) the pilot is able to mark individual hardpoints to ARMED. This will arm only selected hardpoints - useful for munition conservation.


3.0.2 - EQUIP MPD PAGE
The AH-94’s EQUIP MPD page shows all hardpoints and munitions that may be stored on them. When a specific weapon is selected on the MFCD page, there is the option to arm (mentioned above) and change options for weapons (mentioned below). Examples of options with the EQUIP page are: Uncage Mode, Ripple and Salvo settings for rockets, etc. 


3.0.3 - GPS MPD PAGE
The GPS MPD page allows for centralized upload, download, management, and designation of GPS Coordinates. Coordinates can be obtained in one of three ways:
      1. From the mission computer (MSN Prefix)
      2. From onboard systems (TADS, NAV, FCR) (GRP Prefix)
      3. From other aircraft (First 3 letters of sender's name prefix)
The GPS page is split into two segments: the group list on the left and the coordinate list on the right. The group list can be navigated with the arrow buttons on the left, and the coordinate list with the ones on the right. Group prefixes indicate their source (see list above). New groups can be created and deleted with buttons on the bottom left. Selected coordinates can be set as a waypoint with the WPT button, and a group can be made into a path for cruise missiles with the PATH button. Currently selected coordinates are displayed on the NAV and HMDS as a large triangle. Coordinates in a group are displayed on the NAV as small triangles. When using GPS bombs, the bombs will guide to the currently selected coordinates. If set to AUTO mode, the selected coordinates will automatically cycle down in the list after release of a bomb.


3.0.4 - Dynamic Launch Zone (DLZ) Indicator
The Dynamic Launch Zone (DLZ) indicator is used in the employment of all munitions, air to air or air to ground, to show the effective launch limits of the weapon. The DLZ resembles an elongated six (6), and it appears directly left of the altitude tape when a suitable missile and target has been selected. The DLZ has three elements: the Minimum Range Indicator (MRI), the Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ), and the Range Indicator (RI). The MRI is a horizontal line below the DLZ. The WEZ is the elongated six. The RI is the arrowhead on the left of the WEZ. Follow the guide below to read the DLZ.
      * If the RI is above the WEZ, the weapon is out of range.
      * If the RI is within the section of the WEZ with only one line, the weapon is within maximum range (RMAX).
      * If the target is heading away from the launch aircraft or turns away from the launch aircraft after the weapon is employed, the weapon will miss.
      * If the RI is within the section of the WEZ with 2 lines, the weapon is in Minimum Abort Range (MAR).
      * If the weapon is employed within MAR, the weapon will hit the target, even if it is nose cold or recommits.
      * If the RI is below the WEZ and above the MRI, the weapon is below minimum range.
      * If the RI is below the WEZ and the MRI, there may be a possible rift in time or an issue with the range computer.
      * If this occurs, contact the maintenance department post-flight and note it in the debrief.
When in doubt, if the shoot lights are illuminated and there has been a "Shoot" enunciation, you should be in range.


________________
3.0.5 - Pylon Tilt Modes
Pylon Tilt is a feature of the Dragonfly's underwing hardpoints, there are several ways to manipulate vertical pylon tilt on the AH-94.


Manual Pylon Tilt:
Pylon tilt can be manually adjusted by either the PIC or CPG by pressing and holding the MOD trigger on the Combat Collective/Left TEDAC Controller respectively and slewing the Left Joystick up/down.


Horizon Track:
Horizon Track is an Auto-Pylon Tilt Mode that attempts to maintain Pylon Tilt level with the HMDS horizon.
Either the PIC/CPG can enter Horizon Track Mode by pressing and holding the MOD trigger on the Combat Collective/Left TEDAC Controller respectively and depressing the Left Joystick. "Auto-Pylon" HMDS Symbology will appear below the Weapon Select Indicator if the weapon is capable of pylon tilt.


TADS Elevation Track:
TADS Elevation Track is an Auto-Pylon Tilt Mode that attempts to maintain Pylon Tilt level with the TADS FOV Reticle. Either PIC/CPG can enter TADS Elevation Track Mode by first entering Horizon Track Mode, and selecting PIP mode (Predicted Impact Point). "Auto-Pylon" HMDS Symbology will appear below the Weapon Select Indicator if the weapon is capable of pylon tilt. While slewing the TADS vertically, TADS Elevation Track Mode will attempt to adjust Pylon Tilt to the TADS current point track elevation.

4 - Advanced Procedures


4.1 - Overview & Multi-Crew Procedures


Overview:
The AH-94 Dragonfly is a Tandem Cockpit Rotorcraft requiring high levels of situational awareness, communication, and coordination to operate combat effectively. This chapter will delve into advanced multi-crew communication, responsibilities, and procedures in the AH-94 as well as Advanced Maneuvers and Firing Techniques. Individual crews may see fit to make adjustments to SOP's to best fit their needs and mission. Assigning responsibilities can be useful in after action reports to determine what went right, and what went wrong. Blame is NOT the name of the game. Pilots interested in expanded explanations of Advanced Procedures see References (Pg. 65).
________________
4.1.1 - Responsibilities
Determining Crew Responsibilities prior to take off reduces the need for unnecessary communications between crew members in flight. This decreases workload and prevents crew from getting in each other's way. Also preventing redundant actions and/or communications.

________________


4.1.2 - Communication
Communication is essential, crew members can easily end up confused, or receiving redundant information in a high-stress, high-workload environment. Dividing communications workload between crew can speed up single ship operation, and is essential when working in a multi-ship, or high threat environment. Individual crews may see fit to make adjustments to Communication SOP’s to best fit their needs and mission.


PIC COMMUNICATIONS:
      1. Communications with ATC
      2. Communications with Other Aircraft within Flight
      3. Communications with other Flights (Flight Lead)
      4. Communications with CPG regarding;
Location
Altitude
Heading
Distance to Target
Munition Choice


A Standard FARM Call looks something like this;


[TACTICAL CALLSIGN] to [Other Rotorcraft] BREAK


[Fuel State], [Ammunition(CANNON)State], [Rocket State], [Missile State]


CPG COMMUNICATIONS:
      1. Communications with Ground Units
      2. Communications with JTAC/FAC
      3. Communications with PIC regarding;
Location
Altitude
Heading
Distance to Target
Munition Choice


A Standard On-Station Call looks something like this;

[Distance] to target area, [Flight Munitions State], Playtime:[Fuel State], Awaiting Tasking.
________________
Technique, Pattern, Munitions, Range (TPMR):
A TPMR Brief is the communication between CPG and TAC or CPG and PIC to deconflict and prepare engagements in a danger close or high threat environment. Aviators can begin by applying specific techniques, such as diving fire to reduce dispersion and the risk of ricochet, dependent on the terrain. Aviators also select specific flight patterns to orient the aircraft’s weapon systems and to minimize risks to friendly troops. For example, when Soldiers are danger close, aviators may execute a racetrack pattern parallel to friendly troops to minimize the risk of long or short rounds. Aviators then select the available munitions best suited for the target and situation. Finally Aviators discuss engagement and disengagement ranges prior to ingress. Once both the CPG and PIC or CPG and TAC(see Clearance to Fire) have completed a TPMR Brief, the TAC will clear the rotorcraft Hot for one pass. If the engagement is unsuccessful, the TPMR Brief will begin again to ensure an accurate and safe engagement. When a TAC is not available, a more fluid TPMR Brief can be enacted between PIC and CPG.
Technique Pattern Munitions Range
An example TPMR Brief between a FAC(A)/JTAC/FO and CPG looks something like this;
[FAC(A)/JTAC/FO] to [TACTICAL CALLSIGN] BREAK
“I have friendly infantry 100m South of my designated GPS point taking small arms and RPG contact in the field to the North of the road” OVER
[TACTICAL CALLSIGN] to [FAC(A)/JTAC/FO] BREAK
“We are flying North to South [Figure Eights] to the East and have a visual on friendly infantry South of the designated GPS point and the field North of the road” OVER
[FAC(A)/JTAC/FO] to [TACTICAL CALLSIGN] BREAK
“Copy last, you are cleared hot East to West on Infantry North of the Road” OVER
[TACTICAL CALLSIGN] to [FAC(A)/JTAC/FO] BREAK
“Copy, turning in East to West, performing a [Bump] at [2nm], Engaging with [70mm Rockets] switching to [30mm] at [1nm], turning out South at [.5nm]” OVER
 [FAC(A)/JTAC/FO] to [TACTICAL CALLSIGN] BREAK
“Fire mission ineffective, we are still in contact, you are cleared hot West to East for a repeat strike on Infantry North of the road” OVER




Battle Damage Assessment (BDA):
Calling for a BDA happens after the Target(s) have been neutralized. A Standard BDA consists of; visually inspecting friendly rotorcraft for damage, and visually confirming destruction of enemy target(s).
Traveling and Bounding Overwatch:
Traveling Overwatch is a technique used in Medium-High Threat environments to provide cover to rotorcraft performing fire missions. The Overwatch rotorcraft maintains sensors on the target area while the attacking rotorcraft engages, providing additional situational awareness and relay additional target data for re-engagements. Bounding Overwatch is also a technique used in Medium-High Threat environments to provide cover to rotorcraft performing terrain bounding maneuvers to navigate the area of operations. The Overwatch rotorcraft maintains sensors on the target area while the Bounding rotorcraft repositions. The roles are then reversed each time the flight needs to reposition, the Bounding rotorcraft becomes Overwatch and the Overwatch rotorcraft then begins their own relocation.
Secondary Fire Missions:
After unsuccessful fire missions, requesting a secondary fire mission can be quicker than repositioning for a second approach. Provide target and terrain information, as well as any variables that foiled the first fire mission to other rotorcraft.
Clearance to Fire:
Clearance to fire is ultimately given by the TAC. NOT the PIC, or CPG. The TAC or Terminal Attack Controller, usually a FAC(A) or JTAC, is the individual given the authority to control the maneuvering of attacking aircraft and grant weapons release clearance to the same aircraft in Close Air Support missions. 
*If the mission type is not CAS (defined in Index), clearance to fire is granted by the PIC.
Lase & Store:
Lasing and Storing is the practice of acquiring and storing Target GPS data in the IND. This practice builds situational awareness and allows for rapid acquisition of multiple targets. Lasing and Storing also reduces necessary communication between PIC and CPG. Transmitting target GPS coordinates between aircraft may be required for secondary fire missions, or target deconfliction. 


Target Deconfliction:
Target Deconfliction is the practice of identifying and designating targets to separate aircraft. This prevents multiple aircraft engaging the same target, decreasing combat effectiveness.
The Bump:
The Bump is a high-pitch attitude, unguided rocket and fixed gun firing technique used in medium to high threat environments. 
      1. Maintain Airspeed 90kn-170kn
      2. Pitch up (+20° to +30°)
      3. Attain 700-1200ft in altitude
      4. Pitch down (-10° to -25°)
      5. Acquire firing solution
      6. Engage targets
Orbits/Eights:
Orbits are utilized in low threat environments to maintain TADS within gimbal limits on the target area. Orbits can also be used in low threat environments to support ground units in transit or in densely populated areas.
Eights is short form for Figure Eights. Maneuvering in a figure eight pattern perpendicular to the target area allows for rotorcraft to maintain airspeed in medium to high threat environments AND keep the TADS within gimbal limits on the target area. ‘Flying Eights’ also allows for easy transition between 2 pairs of ingress and egress points, this prevents repeat attack runs.
Unmasking in Flight:
Unmasking in Flight is a technique of temporarily increasing altitude allowing the CPG to slew the TADS on target to Lase & Store. Similar to the infantry tactic of “I’m up, they see me, I'm down”.
Set/Stack:
Set/Stack is terminology used by flight leads to communicate with their flight where and how to maneuver in relation to the lead rotorcraft in a battle state. The Lead Rotorcraft will state the area of the zone they wish to occupy and will order wingmen to occupy a zone left or right of the lead.
A Standard Set/Stack Order looks something like this;


[TACTICAL CALLSIGN] to [Other Rotorcraft] BREAK
Lead is SET: [LEFT/RIGHT], STACK [LEFT/RIGHT]
________________


Rapid Fire:
The AGM-114 Hellfire fired in quick succession can allow crews to engage multiple targets simutaneously in medium to high threat environments. A standard 6 second spacing is allowed for adequate time for the missile to maneuver on to a nearby target. 
A rapid Hellfire engagement looks something like this;
      1. Maintain Target(s) in TADS
      2. “Rifle”
      3. Count 6 Mississippi
      4. “Rifle”
      5. Repeat AS REQUIRED
      6. Guide first Hellfire on Target
      7. Switch Target
      8. Guide second Hellfire on Target
      9. Repeat AS REQUIRED
Pitchback Turn:
A Pitch Back Turn is a high pitch angle unguided rocket firing technique similar to ‘The Bump’. The Pitchback Turn can be used by aircrews to quickly engage close proximity targets otherwise unknown to the aircrew.
      1. Maintain Airspeed 90kn-170kn
      2. Pitch up (+20° to +30°)
      3. Attain 700-1200ft in altitude
      4. Perform 180° Cyclic Turn
      5. Pitch down (-10° to -25°)
      6. Acquire firing solution
      7. Engage targets

      3. Shut Down Engines/APU
      4. Disembark (BAIL)


________________
4.2.4 - Auto-Rotation Procedure:
OVERVIEW:
Autorotation refers to the descending maneuver in which the engine is disengaged from the main rotor system and the rotor blades are driven solely by the upward flow of air through the rotor. It is analogous to the gliding flight of a fixed-wing aircraft. The most common reason for autorotation is an engine malfunction or failure, but autorotation can also be performed in the event of a complete tail rotor failure, or following loss of tail-rotor effectiveness. Primary control of the rate of descent is airspeed. Higher or lower airspeeds are obtained with the cyclic pitch control just as in normal flight. Rate of descent is high at zero airspeed, but even with no airspeed the rotor is quite effective, as it has nearly the drag coefficient of a parachute. An optimum landing maneuver stops all of vertical movement, horizontal movement and rotational movement within the craft to a perfect standstill. In practice a perfect landing is rarely achievable


AUTO-ROTATION PROCEDURE:
      1. Immediately reduce Collective Input
      2. Apply Left Pedal
      3. Maintain 50kn-90kn Airspeed
      4. Confirm Master Arm OFF
      5. Jettison ALL
      6. Begin -15° to -20° Glide Slope toward LZ
      7. Manage Rate of Descent and Airspeed with Cyclic
      8. Increase Collective Input AS REQUIRED
      9. Perform Landing
________________
4.3 - Missile Evasion
Overview:
Missile Evasion in a Rotorcraft is similar to Missile Evasion in a Fixed Wing Aircraft in many ways. The main differences being Manouverability and Top Airspeed. The Dragonflies first line of defense against attack is keeping out of range. The helicopter is specifically designed to fly low to the ground, hiding behind cover whenever possible.
4.3.1 - TERRAIN MASKING
WHAT: Terrain Masking is the most reliable maneuver that can be used to break a radar missile lock. In this maneuver, the defending aircraft simply use ground obstacles to break line-of-sight with the radar source.  This radar source can be the ground control radar, hostile aircraft radar, or the missile itself.
WHEN: This maneuver is ineffective: at sea, or when the radar source is a high-flying aircraft. This maneuver can be used at any time before or after a missile is launched.
HOW:
1.  Identify radar source using RWR (HMDS most effective).
2.  Maneuver in such a way that terrain or obstacles break radar source’s line-of-sight with DA.
3.  Ensure the warning tone has gone silent before emerging.
4.  IF warning tone continues, identify incoming missile and mask.




________________
4.2.3 - DOPPLER NOTCHING
WHAT: Doppler Notching is a precise maneuver that, if done successfully, can completely break lock from an incoming missile. Doppler notching takes advantage of a radar missile’s tracking system in a way that makes the DA “blend” into the terrain.  Radar guided missiles distinguish their targets from the terrain below them by looking at the doppler shift of the reflection. If a DA is flying below, and perfectly perpendicular to the radar sensor, the missile or sensor will be unable to distinguish it from the passing terrain.
WHEN: Notching can ONLY be used when the missile is significantly above the target. This means it is a good strategy to be used with some slight dragging. It is also good to use with beaming, as notching obligates beaming (unless you are a VTOL). The effectiveness of this maneuver varies based on distance (farther = better), quality of the radar missile, and the source of the radar signals. Notching can only be effective against one missile at a time unless multiple are fired from the same source.  It is good practice to not solely rely on notching when trying to evade.
HOW:
1.  Identify radar source
2.  Fly below radar source if not already
3.  Turn so that the radar source is to your 3 or 9 o’clock.
4.  Fly so that the source stays at 3 or 9 o’clock.
5. Chaff
If missile lock is not lost after a few seconds;
1.  Identify missile
2.  Turn so that the missile is at your 3 or 9 o’clock.
3. Chaff
If missile lock is not lost after a few seconds, abandon the notch attempt and employ other defensive tactics.
________________
4.2.4 - IR-GUIDED 
OPERATION OF IR-GUIDED MISSILES:
IR-Guided air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, commonly referred to as “heat seekers”, acquire their targets by locking on to the infrared radiation (heat) of the target aircraft, usually the engine(s). Due to this, they have a relatively short range. Most, if not all, IR-guided missiles are all-aspect, meaning that they can acquire a lock from all aspects of a plane, not just the rear, where the engine(s) are located. If there are multiple targets in a close area, the missile will lock on the strongest (warmest). The missile will lock on to the stronger heat signature of the flares and strike them instead of the rotorcraft.


EVASION:
         1. Turn to the 9 o’clock or 3 o’clock of the missile (if possible)
         2. Dive or Climb depending on current altitude and airspeed
         3. Dispense Flares in bursts of 5-10.

Afterwords
Dubya:
I like helicopters. If you enjoy Rotorcraft as much as I do, you may find this manual useful. I highly recommend checking out the References section if you need additional understanding of concepts discussed in this manual. Vortex Ring State, Mushing, Blade Damage, and Drivetrain Stress is not modeled in VTOL VR. Additionally, Torque and Transient Torque Spikes are not modeled realistically although I wish they were...  I therefore do not discuss VRS, Mushing, or Transient Torque Spikes and their nuances. I otherwise cover rotary physics modeled by VTOL VR in this manual. Radar Left, Center Stick Based.
 Always Remember: 
Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast! 
Thanks for Reading!
