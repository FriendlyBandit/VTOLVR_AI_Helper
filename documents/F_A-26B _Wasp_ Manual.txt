1.1 - OVERVIEW


In this manual, you will find instructions to help pilot the F/A-26B Wasp in a modern combat theater. Begin by reading the aircraft overview, and read Cockpit Instruments to gain a situational understanding of the cockpit’s layout. It is mandatory to memorize the F/A-26B Wasp’s procedures.




1.2 - AIRCRAFT OVERVIEW


The F/A-26 Wasp is a carrier-based, air-superiority aircraft that can be fitted for ground operations. Originally developed in 2023 by McDonnell Douglas (Boeing), the original “A” model has since been replaced by the newer “B” model, developed in 2025, which features a new radar (The AN/APG-75), a new, exclusive version of the AIM-120 (the AIM-120J), and variable geometry air intakes. The aircraft also features an all-in-one situational awareness, navigation, and Datalink display (the Garmin-54MNAV). In addition to technological updates, the “B” model comes standard with modifications from 2024’s Pilot Improved Morale Program (PIMP) that adds several quality-of-life features for the pilot (See below for details). The Wasp is fitted with 5 underbelly hardpoints and 8 wing-mounted hardpoints for mounting munitions, totaling 13. The AN/AAQ-28 Targeting Pod can also be mounted externally without the use of a hardpoint. Fuel capacity is 15,840 Pounds but can be expanded to 43,560 Pounds with external fuel tanks (that take up hardpoints) and a further 29,700 Pounds with the use of conformal tanks attached to the sides of the air intakes.

NOTES:
The player was included as part of the Pilot Improved Morale Program, or ‘PIMP’, which was aimed at helping keep pilots’ morale up during long and/or stressful operations, using suggestions made by pilots themselves. Other improvements from the program included restructuring the flight chair for comfort, improving the flavor of the survival kit protein bars, and the inclusion of an IR strobe light into the ejection seat for rescue signaling after a bailout. Recent reports that have attributed the music player to the heightened aggression and lessened inhibitions seen in some pilots are so far just speculation. - PIMP project review.

DESCRIPTION:
The AN/AAQ-28 LITENING Targeting Pod is an advanced precision targeting system currently in use with many military aircraft. LITENING is instrumental in the employment of many air-to-ground weapons, being necessary for use of optically-guided and laser-guided weapons. LITENING can also dramatically improve the accuracy of GPS guided and iron bombs. LITENING must be mounted externally to the aircraft prior to startup to function. The targeting pod contains a high-resolution, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor that displays an infrared image of the target to the pilot. The pod has 7 zoom levels, allowing it to be effectively used as both a targeting and reconnaissance system. The pod also contains a CCD camera used to obtain target imagery in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The pod is equipped with a laser designator for precise delivery of laser-guided munitions and an Infrared marker for targeting coordination at night. The guidance laser is always on, but the marking laser can be toggled on/off. A laser rangefinder provides accurate ranging information up to 23NM. The targeting pod is POINT and AREA stabilized, simplifying target acquisition and weapons employment. The pod can be locked at ranges up to 23NM, however it is possible to observe with limited resolution for an additional 5NM.

DESCRIPTION:
The AN/APG-75 Radar is an advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar that can select and provide post-launch guidance information on up to 4 targets at a time. It has a maximum range of 64 Nautical Miles and an effective launch range of 30 Nautical Miles. It is important to note that the Locking function does not function as a traditional Single-Target-Track (STT) would. In addition to providing a large amount of radar energy to the locked target, the APG-75 can also maintain track of selected targets while in a locked state. The APG-75 was first developed in 2024 and was not installed in the previous iteration of the jet; the F/A-26A. Along with the new radar, a new version of the AIM-120 AMRAAM was developed; the AIM-120-J, to be used only in conjunction with the APG-75 system. The APG-75 can also connect directly to the E-2, E-3, and E-4 AWACS Systems through an advanced datalink system.

   10. Shows the direction of the nose. Does NOT show the aircraft’s direction of travel - see item 12.
   11. Gives a reference to the horizon, in 5-degree steps.
   12. Indicates the actual direction of travel of the aircraft. Corresponds to the aircraft’s central body/landing gear.
   13. Indicates altitude, either:
a. above ground level
b. above sea level.
   14. Indicates vertical speed.
   15. Shows a visualization of your control inputs, in real-time. The vertical line represents rudder, and the dot represents aileron and elevator input.


NOTES:


This section covers all major aspects of the HUD, however, in the shown diagram (a carrier landing) the TGP reticle, radar symbols, and weapon reticles are not displayed. References to these are present in other chapters.




DESCRIPTION:


Developed by Rockwell Industries, the F/A-26B’s Heads Up Display is a marvel of modern engineering. Through a combination of advanced optics and ultra-high-resolution displays, the HUD delivers clarity never seen before. The pilot can clearly distinguish HUD markings and the outside world, but the HUD’s electrochromic tint option allows the pilot to prioritize HUD symbology over visibility, making it a powerful tool to aid in Beyond-Visual-Range (BVR) dogfights. The system operates in tandem with the HMCS, delivering extremely powerful systems to the pilot, such as head-track for IR missiles; giving them the edge in close-in combat.
However, the HUD serves as a crucial tool in calmer phases of flight, too. Prior to the development of the F/A-26B HUD, pilots often struggled with low-visibility carrier landings. An F/A-18C pilot stated that “...when operating from the ocean, fog is common, and fog does not mix well with bright lights. It scatters everywhere.” To address this issue, Rockwell Industries designed the HUD to directly operate with the Garmin 54-MNAV display, allowing a data-link to be made with the carrier and showing the IFLOLS in the lower-left corner of the HUD. This simplifies the recovery process and sets new standards for military safety.

2.7 - GARMIN-MILSPEC AUTOPILOT/AUTOTHROTTLE


BASIC OPERATION:
      1. Set HUD switch ON
      2. The Autopilot has 3 modes of operation:  
         1. NAV - When set to NAV, the autopilot will fly to a predetermined altitude and heading in order to reach the selected waypoint. Waypoints have to be selected through the mission computer for NAV mode to function.
         2. ALT - When set to ALT, the autopilot will hold the current altitude. The altitude to hold can be changed using the APALT knob located in the middle center console.
         3. HDG - When set to HDG, the autopilot will hold the current heading. The heading to hold can be changed using the HDG knob located in the middle center console. Note that the autopilot can only bank up to 10 degrees.
         3. The Autothrottle has one mode of operation:
         1. SPD - When set to SPD, the Autothrottle will hold the current speed. The speed to hold can also be changed using the SPD knob located in the middle center console.
         4. Press the desired autopilot button to enable the autopilot in the selected mode.
         1. Multiple autopilots can be selected at a time.
         2. NAV and HDG are mutually exclusive. 
         3. ALT can be used in conjunction with NAV and HDG.
         5. Release the stick.
         6. Press the SPD button to enable the autothrottle.
         7. Release the throttle.
         8. Pressing OFF will disable all active autopilots/autothrottles
         9. The autopilot suite features an emergency disconnect. Apply strong roll or pitch input to disconnect all autopilots. Apply any throttle input to disconnect the autothrottle.


DESCRIPTION:
The Garmin-MILSPEC all-in-one autopilot/autothrottle package is 
a simplified autopilot package developed by Garmin for military aircraft in 2021. It focuses on reliability, safety, and ease of use. The system has seen great popularity with pilots for the latter reason. Where previous instruments needed precise calibration, the Garmin-MILSPEC system can be adjusted on-the-go anytime with ease.

2.8 - HORIZONTAL SITUATION INDICATOR (HSI)


SYMBOLOGY:


  



         1. Distance From Waypoint Indicator: Indicates the current distance from a selected waypoint or runway in nautical miles
         2. Current Heading Pointer: Displays the current heading
         3. Autopilot Heading Pointer: Displays the selected heading for the autopilot to follow
         4. Autopilot Heading Knob: Adjusts the heading for the autopilot to follow
         5. Course Select Pointer: Displays the heading from which the pilot wants to enter the waypoint from (more detail in the Navigation section)


         6. Course Deviation Bar: Displays how far off the pilot is from intercepting the desired course (TIP: Think of this bar as the runway relative towards you. If the bar is on the left of the Symbolic Aircraft, then the actual runway is to your left and vice versa.)
         7. Course Select Knob: Adjusts the bearing that the pilot wants to enter the waypoint from. However, once the pilot is within 6-7 nautical miles of a runway, the Course Select Pointer will automatically adjust itself to the correct bearing and the knob will no longer adjust the course
         8. TO/FROM Indicator: Indicates whether the pilot is flying towards or away from the waypoint (is normally parallel to the Course Select Pointer)
         9. Glide Slope Pointer : Only displays when cleared to land by ATC. Displays the glide slope that the pilot must maintain for a safe and successful landing
         10. Glide Slope Deviation Bar: Displays the pilot’s degree of deviation from the targeted glide slope. Once the Deviation Bar is lined up with the Glide Pointers, the pilot is on the correct glide slope.


Basic Navigation With the HSI:


Course Select:


        The Course Select Pointer allows pilots to accurately line themselves up with a runway. For the Course Select Pointer to activate, the pilot must set a waypoint or request a landing from an airbase or carrier. Once the pointer appears, the pilot may adjust the heading of the pointer using the Course Select Knob. If the destination is the carrier or runway, the pointer will automatically adjust itself to the exact heading of the runway once within 6-7 nautical miles(the Glide Slope Indicator will also appear). 
        The Course Select Pointer will guide the pilot to intercept a waypoint or runway at a desired heading. A way to think about this concept is to imagine a straight line coming out of your desired waypoint. The Course Select Knob will spin the line around the waypoint. The line represents the course that the pilot wants to take to enter that waypoint. The Deviation Bar represents that line relative to you. If the bar is to the right of the Symbolic aircraft, then the desired course is to the right of the aircraft. If the pilot is on the desired course, the Course Deviation Bar will be lined up with the pointer.
        
Lining up with the runway:


         1. Request landing from desired runway or carrier
         2. The air traffic controller will give you 2 pieces of information: The bearing of where the runway is from your location and the runway number. Generally, it is not recommended to head directly towards the runway due to the likelihood of not being properly lined up with it. This will result in an unstable approach and a potential crash. The runway number indicates the heading that the runway is facing. Runways are numbered between 00-36; multiply that number by 10 to know the true heading. (For the carrier, the runway number does not represent the direction of the carrier, but the direction of the runway on the carrier, which is angled slightly to the left.)
         3. Once the ATC controller tells you the runway number, adjust the Course Selection pointer to the heading of the runway (e.g. If the runway number is 26, adjust the Course Pointer to heading 260).
         4. Adjust current course depending on the Course Deviation Bar. (It is recommended to keep the current heading in between the Deviation Bar and the Course Select Pointer to smoothly turn into the desired course).




Key:
         1. Green: Aircraft
         2. Path: A Potential Path To Take To Intercept Desired Course
         3. Orange: Desired Course Indicated By Pointer
         4. Blue: Runway
 
  

  







GLIDE SLOPE:


The glide slope is indicated by how high or low the Glide Slope Deviation Bar is relative to the Glide Slope Pointers. I.E. if the deviation bar is ABOVE the Glide Slope Pointers, then the pilot is too LOW and must either increase or maintain their altitude to intercept the targeted glide slope. If the bar is BELOW the Glide Slope Pointers, the pilot is too HIGH and must decrease their altitude to acquire the correct glide slope. Once the Glide Slope Deviation Bar and Glide Slope Pointers are lined up, the pilot is on the Glide Slope.   
              
       
   Below Glide Slope     On Glide Slope    Above Glide Slope
 


DESCRIPTION:


The Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) is a tried and true aviation instrument used to guide pilots to waypoints and runways. The HSI allows pilots to accurately enter waypoints from a certain heading, approach a runway from the correct heading, and keep a nominal glide slope on the approach when landing. In low-visibility conditions, such as night-time or foggy weather, the HSI is used to navigate through waypoints and locate runways. For the F/A-26B, the HSI is pivotal for a CASE 2 and CASE 3 recovery.

3.0 - GENERAL PREFACE


3.0.1 - WEAPONS ARMING
Before any weapons can be fired, they must be armed. This feature is nothing new, being standard in fighters for decades. In the F/A-26B, there are 2 ways to arm weapons. 
         * The first is the MASTER ARM switch. The MASTER ARM switch is a covered switch that when switched, will arm all equipped weapons. 
         * The second way is through the MFCD EQUIP page. By switching the mark mode to ARM (upper-right MFCD) the pilot is able to mark individual hardpoints to ARMED. This will arm only selected hardpoints - useful if you are avoiding Winchester.


3.0.2 - EQUIP MFCD PAGE
The F/A-26B’s EQUIP MFCD page shows all hardpoints and munitions that may be stored on them. When a specific weapon is selected on the MFCD page, there is the option to arm (mentioned above) and change options for weapons (mentioned below). Examples of options with the EQUIP page are: CCIP/CCRP for bombs, guidance package on/off for GPS-Guided bombs, ripple for bombs/rockets, etc. 


3.0.3 - GPS MFCD PAGE
The GPS MFCD page allows for centralized upload, download, managment, and designation of GPS Coordinates. Coordinates can be obtained in one of three ways:
         1. From the mission computer (MSN Prefix)
         2. From onboard systems (TGP or NAV) (GRP Prefix)
         3. From other aircraft (First 3 letters of sender's name prefix)
The GPS page is split into two segments: the group list on the left and the coordinate list on the right. The group list can be navigated with the arrow buttons on the left, and the coordinate list with the ones on the right. Group prefixes indicate their source (see list above). New groups can be created and deleted with buttons on the bottom left. Selected coordinates can be set as a waypoint with the WPT button, and a group can be made into a path for cruise missiles with PATH button. Currently selected coordinates are displayed on the NAV and HUD as a large triangle. Coordinates in a group are displayed on the NAV as small triangles. When using GPS bombs, the bombs will guide to the currently selected coordinates. If set to AUTO mode, the selected coordinates will automatically cycle down in the list after release of a bomb.


3.0.4 - DYNAMIC LAUNCH ZONE (DLZ) INDICATOR
The Dynamic Launch Zone (DLZ) indicator is used in the employment of all missiles, air to air or air to ground (save for the AGM-89 and -161), to show the effective launch limits of the weapon. The DLZ resembles an elongated six (6), and it appears directly left of the altitude tape when a suitable missile and target has been selected. The DLZ has three elemets: the Minimum Range Indicator (MRI), the Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ), and the Range Indicator (RI). The MRI is a horizontal line below the DLZ. The WEZ is the elongated six. The RI is the arrowhead on the left of the WEZ. Follow the guide below to read the DLZ.
         * If the RI is above the WEZ, the weapon is out of range.
         * If the RI is within the section of the WEZ with only one line, the weapon is within maximum range (RMAX).
         * If the target is heading away from the launch aircraft or turns away from the launch aircraft after the weapon is employed, the weapon will miss.
         * If the RI is within the section of the WEZ with 2 lines, the weapon is in No-Escape Range (RNES).
         * If the weapon is employed within RNES, the weapon will hit the target, even if it is turned around or turns around.
         * If the RI is below the WEZ and above the MRI, the weapon is below minimum range.
         * If the RI is below the WEZ and the MRI, there may be a possible rift in time or an issue with the range computer.
         * If this occurs, contact the maintenance department post-flight and note it in the debrief.
         * When in doubt, if the shoot lights are illuminated and there has been a "Shoot" enunciation, you should be in range.

3.1 - GBU-12 LASER-GUIDED BOMB




BASIC OPERATION:
         1. Check Master Arm ON  
         2. Select GBU-12
         3. Start TGP
         4. Select target using TGP
         5. Align bomb diamond inside firing reticle (best shot inner circle)
         6. Press trigger to release
         7. Call out “Pickle”
         8. Ensure that laser is on target until confirmed hit to hold tracking
 
EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
Due to their lower payload and agility midair, laser-guided munitions are best suited for Close Air Support (CAS). They perform extremely well when attacking armored vehicles, and due to the ability to move mid-air, convoys. Laser-guided munitions are not recommended for use against heavy, fixed targets (i.e. Bunkers) due to their small payload.


________________
3.2 - GPS-GUIDED BOMBS


GPS-GUIDED BOMBS IN OPERATION WITH THE F/A-26B:
            1. GBU-38 500lb bomb
            2. GBU-39 250lb glide bomb


BASIC OPERATION:
            1. Check Master Arm ON
            2. Select weapon of choice
            3. Start TGP
            4. Designate target using TGP
            5. Press GPS-S to send GPS coordinates of target
            6. Check target is selected in GPS MFCD page
            7. Align bomb diamond inside firing reticle (Best shot inner circle)
            8. Press trigger to release
            9. Call out “Pickle”


EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
GPS-Guided bombs are best suited for precision strike roles, with the GBU-38 acting as a great bunker-buster, and the GBU-39 being able to take out long-distance targets with ease. The one downside of GPS-guided bombs is that due to their use of fixed coordinates, they are completely ineffective when being used against moving targets. GPS-Guided bombs can also disable their guidance package entirely through the EQUIP MFCD page, essentially serving as a dual-purpose weapon and making unguided bombs obsolete.




________________
3.3 - UNGUIDED BOMBS


UNGUIDED BOMBS IN OPERATION WITH THE F/A-26B:
            1. Mk.82 500lb bomb
            2. Mk.82AIR 500lb High-Drag bomb
            3. Mk.83 1000lb bomb
            4. CBU-97 Cluster bomb


BASIC OPERATION:
            1. Check Master Arm ON
            2. Select weapon of choice
            3. Using Constantly Calculated Release Point Automatic (CCRP AUTO):  
               1. Activate TGP
               2. Designate target using TGP
               3. Select “CCRP AUTO” in the EQUIP MFCD page for your bomb of choice
               4. Line up with target using dotted line as guide
               5. Hold trigger (Bomb will be automatically released)
               4. Using Constantly Calculated Impact Point (CCIP)
               1. Visually acquire target
               2. Climb to 5000ft above target
               3. Dive towards target
               4. Press trigger to release when bomb pipper is over target
               5. Call out “Pickle”






EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
Unguided bombs perform well against fixed targets like bunkers, due to their heavier payload. They also work well as a suppression weapon; able to be fired repeatedly to decimate a large area of targets. If need be due to budget or other reasons, unguided bombs can be used for the purpose that GPS-Guided bombs fill - a precision strike weapon. However not recommended, it is possible with the use of CCRP AUTO.

3.4 - ANTI-RADIATION MISSILES


ANTI-RADIATION MISSILES CURRENTLY IN OPERATION WITH THE F/A-26B:
               1. AGM-126 SideARM II
               2. AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM)


BASIC OPERATION:
               1. Check Master Arm ON
               2. Select weapon of choice
               3. Acquire target using ARAD MFCD page (Note: The ARAD works in the same way as the RADAR, see above for operation information)
               4. Align targeting circle over target
               5. Confirm target is within range (See 3.0.4)
               6. Press trigger to launch
               7. Call out “Magnum”


EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
It is suggested that in all air-to-ground missions where there is a reasonable chance of radar-guided anti-air presence, that one or more Anti-Radiation missiles be equipped in at least one aircraft participating in the flight. Anti-Radiation missiles are the primary Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) weapons, and are designed solely for that purpose. 


NOTES:
“Let’s raise a drink to the poor bastards on SEAD duty, who’s daring keeps the rest of us fighting! Here's to them!” - Anonymous pilot at servicemen’s club. 












3.5 - MISC. A/G


HYDRA-70 ROCKET POD


PREFACE:
The HYDRA-70 has customizable launch options. Before engagement, view the EQUIP page in the MFCD and customize the settings to your liking.
               * RIPPLE - Indicates how often rockets will be launched. Measured in Releases Per Minute.
               * SALVO - Indicates how many rockets will be fired at once. Set to 1 as default.


BASIC OPERATION:
               1. Set MASTER ARM ON  
               2. Confirm HYDRA-70 ARMED in MFCD EQUIP PAGE
               3. Cycle WEAPON SWITCH BUTTON Until HYDRA-70 Visible (TOP-LEFT OF HUD)
               4. (OPTIONAL) Designate Target with TGP
               5. Confirm target is within range (See 3.0.4)
               6. Press (and hold if ripple selected) TRIGGER to Launch


EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
The Hydra-70 rocket pod is a must for Close Air Support (CAS) missions; with its 10lb warhead, it can decimate any armored targets in a 30ft area and destroy soft targets in a further 160ft. It is recommended to use the Hydra-70 in a method similar to unguided bombs; climb to 5000ft above target, dive, and launch while diving on to target. The Hydra-70 can also fly extremely fast, with an initial acceleration of 87kts, and a maximum speed of up to 1000kts.


NOTES:
While technically capable, the Hydra pod should never be used in so-called ‘Full salvo’ mode to ‘blot out the sun with rockets’. The wastefulness of this action aside, the structure of the missile pod may rupture from the extreme stress or rockets in flight may impact each other, causing a chain reaction directly in front of the craft. - Engineer G. Faws


AGM-89 ANTI-SHIP CRUISE MISSILE & AGM-161 JOINT ANTI-SURFACE STANDOFF MISSILE (JASSM)


BASIC OPERATION:
                  1. Designate target GPS coordinates
                  2. Select desired weapon
                  3. (AGM-89 ONLY) Set one of 4 attack modes in EQUIP MFCD page:
                  1. Sea Skim - The missile flies extremely low, skimming the sea.
                  2. Sea Skim Evasive (SSEVASIVE) - The missile flies extremely low, swerving to evade CIWS. To use this mode, see WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT - GENERAL PREFACE.
                  3. Direct - The missile flies directly to the target like the AGM-65F
                  4. Popup - The missile flies in SSEVASIVE until its terminal phase, where it pops up and dives on to its target
                  4. Align target inside targeting circle
                  5. Press trigger to launch
                  6. (AGM-89) Call out “Bruiser”
                  7. (AGM-161) Call out “Greyhound”


EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
The AGM-89 and AGM-161 excel in long-range target destruction. They are a must-use when going against a large fleet or an area with many SAM’s. However, they are not recommended for use in close ranges as they are slower and less maneuverable than other Air-To-Ground missiles.

3.6 - OPTICALLY GUIDED AIR-TO-GROUND MISSILES


OPTICALLY GUIDED AIR-TO-GROUND MISSILES CURRENTLY IN OPERATION WITH THE F/A-26B:  
                  1. AGM-65F
                  2. CAGM-6 Smart Cluster Missile


BASIC OPERATION:
                  1. Check Master Arm ON
                  2. Select desired weapon
                  3. Start TGP
                  4. Select target using TGP
                  5. (IF TRIG UNCAGE OFF) Maneuver aircraft towards target until targeting circle is slewed to TGP and tone is audible.
                  6. (IF TRIG UNCAGE ON) Hold trigger. Ensure that the targeting circle has slewed to the TGP and tone is audible.
                  1. If targeting circle does not slew, maneuver the aircraft towards the target.
                  7. Ensure target is within range (See 3.0.4).
                  8. (IF TRIG UNCAGE OFF) Press trigger to launch.
                  9. (IF TRIG UNCAGE ON) Press weapon switch to launch.
                  10. Call out “Rifle”


EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
Much like the GBU-12, Optically Guided Air-To-Ground Missiles (AGM’s), are best suited for attacks on convoys and soft targets. However, Optically Guided AGM’s have one major advantage: they are fire-and-forget. This means that multiple AGM’s can be fired at multiple targets at a time before the first one hits, whereas the GBU-12 can only target one enemy at a time. The CAGM-6 is especially suited for large groups of enemies, as it separates into multiple individually guided submunitions, further decreasing the time to destroy multiple targets. Additionally, the AGM-65 can be used to destroy bunkers in a pinch.

3.7 - AIM-120J ADVANCED MEDIUM RANGE AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE (AMRAAM)


BASIC OPERATION:  
                  1. Switch Master Arm On
                  2. Select The AIM-120
                  3. Select Radar on your MFCD
                  4. Check Radar On
                  5. Turn on SOI
                  6. Select Target
                  7. Lock Target
                  8. Ensure target is within range (See 3.0.4)
                  9. (Optional for best chance of hit) Align the dot in the Targeting Circle 
                  10. Press trigger to launch.
                  11. Call out “Fox Three” To avoid confusion with other launch warnings.
                  12. (Optional) Unlock target, maintaining a Softlock (shown with circle on HUD)
                  13. Return to step 6 and engage up to 3 more targets


EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
The AIM-120J AMRAAM is best suited for Beyond Visual Range (BVR) engagements with its effective launch range of 40NM. It is not, however, well suited for engagements of >4NM because of its sheer size and inability to maneuver as well as an IR-Guided missile. Its 39lb warhead is able to critically damage enemy aircraft in one impact. Even though it is not suited for short-range, it is recommended to carry more AMRAAMs than IR-Guided missiles due to IR-Guided missiles being completely ineffective at ranges exceeding 5NM. The AIM-120 HUD Reticle is shown below.
3.8 - IR-GUIDED AIR-TO-AIR MISSILES
 
PREFACE:
IR missiles have customizable launch options. Before engagement, customize the launch options to your liking through the EQUIP MFCD Page. For high-intensity WVR engagements, the HeadTrack Seek Mode is suggested. Your visor must be lowered while using HeadTrack to see the reticle, and HMCS POWER ON.
Seek Modes: Caged, Uncaged, Head-Track, Vertical Scan


IR-GUIDED AIR-TO-AIR MISSILES CURRENTLY IN OPERATION WITH THE F/A-26B:
                  1. AIM-9M M-13
                  2. AIRS-T

                  1. Check Master Arm ON.
                  2. Select weapon as required
                  3. Align targeting reticle with enemy aircraft
                  4. Wait for high-pitched tone
                  5. Press trigger to launch
                  6. Call out “Fox Two” to avoid confusion with other launch warnings. 


EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
IR-Guided missiles are best-suited for engagements of less than 4NM due to them not being able to detect heat signatures from medium-long ranges. Fired IR missiles have a reliable hit-rate, but it is not guaranteed that one hit will damage a vital component. As such, it is recommended to bring multiple IR-Guided missiles on a mission.


NOTES:
Although not its main purpose and not recommended, the AIRS-T is maneuverable enough to intercept incoming missiles and thus be used as a countermeasure. There have been multiple occasions in which skilled pilots have successfully used the AIRS-T as a countermeasure, one of which ended in complete destruction of the airframe due to the AIRS-T and the incoming missile colliding in close proximity to the DA.

3.9 - M61A1 VULCAN 20MM ROTARY CANNON
BASIC OPERATION:
                  1. Check Master Arm ON
                  2. Select the M61A1 Vulcan
                  3. Lock target with radar, either:
                  1. Automatically when in close range
                  2. Manually through the RADAR MFCD page
                  4. Ensure target is in range (the solid circle around the pilper is NOT full)
                  5. Align gun pipper over target
                  6. Press trigger to fire (If flying with wingmen, call out “GUNS GUNS GUNS”)


EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
Due to its short range, the M61A1 is only suggested to be used as a substitute to IR-Guided missiles. The Cannon can also be used as an Air-To-Ground weapon, but this is not recommended. Due to the M61A1’s extremely high fire rate, short bursts are necessary to prolong ammunition lifespan. Used correctly, the Cannon’s ammunition of 800 rounds can disable over 8 aircraft.

4.2 - MISSILE EVASION: RADAR-GUIDED
OVERVIEW
In a modern combat theatre, radar-guided missiles pose the most serious threat to F/A-26B pilots. F/A-26B units also find themselves more susceptible to radar-guided threats than other USN air combat units due to their mission role and amplified radar cross-section. Because of this, there is no single tactic that can be followed to successfully evade radar-guided missiles. This does not imply that evasion is impossible. A Wasp driver that properly assesses a given situation and combines the right strategies can greatly increase their chance of defeating radar-guided threats. 
This section will be broken up into two parts: First, we will discuss the principles of radar-guided missiles and their relationship to other weapons systems and aircraft. Second, we will explore strategies that can be deployed to defeat radar-guided missiles in various scenarios.
PRINCIPLES:
QUALITIES OF A RADAR-GUIDED MISSILE
A radar-guided missile tracks its target by identifying the reflection of radio and microwave waves reflecting from the target’s surfaces. The source of these radar waves can be an aircraft, ground radar system, or the missile’s internal radar projector. This method allows radar-guided missiles to track targets at much longer ranges than IR systems and thus achieve greater speeds. It is the speed and integrity of radar tracking technology that make radar-guided missiles so deadly.
AIR LAUNCHED
Most modern Air-to-Air radar-guided missiles are “Active”, meaning their internal radar projectors are powerful enough to illuminate their target at medium range, however, this ability degrades at longer distances. Radar guided air-launched missiles will typically rely on aircraft-based radar to track and relay target information until the last few miles. This method has the added benefit of not alerting the targeted aircraft of the position of the missile via RWR. Even if line of sight with the launcher radar projector is broken, an active radar homing (ARH) guided missile is still a threat.
The improvement of stealth and jamming technology in the first quarter of the 21st century has reduced the range at which a weapons-grade track can be acquired. This has reduced the viable shoot range to around 25-35NM as opposed to the 50-60NM of their original design. Although this does allow better defensive posture and a higher evasion rate, it has the unintended consequence of increasing the number of missiles that reach their target before exhausting fuel. A defending pilot will still need to focus on wasting the missile’s energy early on but may find themselves facing a powered missile after only a short period of mid-course defensive tactics.
 
SAM RADAR-GUIDED MISSILES
Radar guided missiles launched from a surface installation require lock-on by ground control radar for a significant portion of the missile’s flight. This means that destroying or breaking line-of-sight with the fire control radar can disable a SAM’s ability to track an aircraft even after the missile has traveled a significant distance. More advanced SAMs have improved ARH capabilities and may remain threatening even after destruction or line-of-sight loss with control radar at range.   
RADAR VS. IR-GUIDED MISSILES
Radar Guided missile systems rely on range, speed, and tracking to kill their target.  As such, the missile itself tends to be heavier, faster, and less maneuverable. Let’s break down these missile types and their qualities.
 
	IR Guided
	Radar Guided
	Speed
	Low
	High
	Acceleration
	High
	Medium
	Maneuverability
	High
	Low
	Range
	Short
	Medium/High
	CM resilience
	Poor
	Good/Very Good
	 
 
ENERGY
Properly deciding the correct course of action when threatened by a radar missile requires an understanding of the energy relationship between it and your aircraft. Many of the strategies in the next section take advantage of the differences in energy usage that exist between an aircraft and the missile threatening it.
Although a Radar guided missile can achieve much greater speeds than an aircraft, it is less able to maneuver in short order. As distance closes, the degrees of its required lead increases. If fired at long range (+20NM) missiles may run out of fuel before impacting targets. This energy is used to accelerate the missile, fight air resistance, and change its velocity vector (maneuvering). Once fuel is depleted, a missile will begin to lose velocity until it reaches its target or begins to fall. Thicker air and frequent maneuvering speed up this process and can quickly reduce the distance a missile can fly at a threatening speed.
Aircraft, on the other hand, have a relatively unlimited amount of potential energy stored as fuel. Although unable to accelerate like or reach the speeds of a missile, an aircraft can continuously expend energy through maneuvering and pushing through air. In addition, the wide surface of the F/A-26B allows for the rapid exchange of forward velocity to angular velocity (trading speed for turning).
All this can be broken down into the following statement: Aircraft have high Delta-V (potential change in velocity) but low impulse (thrust), whereas missiles have low Delta-V but high impulse. Many strategies for defeating radar-guided missiles rely heavily on the exploitation of this relationship.
 
CHAFF
Chaff is a countermeasure deployed by a defending pilot in order to disrupt a missile. The F/A-26B uses a JAFFing technique where radar signals are beamed against the dropped chaff in such a way that even doppler-effect missiles can be fooled if at a lesser extent.
Chaff is far less effective against radar missiles than flares are against IR missiles, but this should not discount its usage. Chaff is used to inhibit a radar’s ability to accurately track a target.
Chaff is only effective with minimal relative velocity to the dispersed chaff, relative to the radar source (generally a beam.) If anything, remember these 4 points on chaff:
1.  Missiles will attempt to search for the target again after chaff has faded away.
2. Deploying chaff is ineffective unless the radar has a lock (TWS or STT.)
3.  Chaff is more situational than flares.
4.  Even if deploying chaff doesn’t break lock, it can greatly reduce the missile’s accuracy in the terminal phase.
 
MANEUVERS:
OVERVIEW
Unlike other topics in this manual, Radar missile evasion does not have a single sequence of steps which ensure success. Instead, radar missile evasion relies on various maneuvers that can be made simultaneously and/or sequentially to maximize chances of survival in any given scenario.
This section will go over these maneuvers, how they work, and when to employ them. This will be followed by example scenarios that showcase how these maneuvers can be used together to achieve evasion.
We will refer to the aircraft defending against the radar missile as the “DA” (defending aircraft) for brevity. 
 
















4.2.1 - TERRAIN MASKING
  

WHAT: Terrain Masking is the most reliable maneuver that can be used to break a radar missile lock. In this maneuver, the DA simply uses ground obstacles to break line-of-sight with the radar source.  This radar source can be the ground control radar, hostile aircraft radar, or the missile itself.
 WHEN: This maneuver should only be considered when flying low over variable terrain or urban areas.  This maneuver is ineffective: at sea, when the radar source is a high-flying aircraft, or when the DA needs to engage hostile air targets with AMRAAMs. This maneuver can be used at any time before or after a missile is launched, however it is most effective early on.
HOW:
1.  Identify radar source using RWR or ARAD (HMCS most effective).
2.  Maneuver in such a way that terrain or obstacles break radar source’s line-of-sight with DA. If flying over mountainous terrain, roll inverted and pull rather than pushing down.
3.  Ensure warning tone has gone silent before emerging.
4.  IF warning tone continues, identify incoming missile and mask that.
 
4.2.2 - BEAMING
WHAT:  Beaming is a maneuver that decreases the kinetic energy of a long-range radar guided missile by forcing it to turn and lead its target. Beaming can be done by leading a missile to the side in one single direction, or by switching flight direction after a few seconds. It is important to note that beaming will not break a missile’s lock or prevent it from reaching the DA. It will simply drain the missile’s energy, making it easier to evade in later maneuvers. Additionally, the optimal start time for a beam is immediately at launch. It is suggested that a beam maneuver be started upon suspected hostile launch or after DA deployment of ordinance. Zig-Zag beaming is only admissible if a missile launch has occurred from beyond 15NM. 
WHEN: Beaming is a good, simple tactic that should be employed early on when terrain masking is not an option. Straight line beaming is also highly effective when defending against radar missiles launched at relatively close range (<15NM) as they have not obtained enough velocity to overcome their lack of maneuverability
  Beaming can be used in conjunction with most other maneuvers in this guide and should always be used to some extent when the DA is still engaging forward. Likewise, the Beaming maneuver is highly effective when used with other tactics such as dragging and going cold.
HOW:
1.  Identify the bearing of the missile visually by its smoke trail, or RWR/ARAD information
2.  Turn at an angle roughly perpendicular to the missile, try not to close distance with the missile too rapidly.
3.  Use full afterburner and continue in this direction for a few seconds. The farther the missile is from you, the longer you should stay in this direction.
4.  (OPTIONAL, if missile is at range) Make a fast high-G turn in the opposite direction and repeat at increasing frequency essentially zig-zagging.
5.  Choose a Terminal strategy once the missile goes pitbull
 
 
4.2.3 - DRIVING
WHAT: Driving is forcing a missile to hit the ground as it tries to lead its target. This is not confirmed to be effective against all missiles in all states, however it is highly effective against SAMS and other missiles prior to the Pitbull phase.
WHEN: Driving should only be used right after the launch of a radar guided missile, and preferably if that missile is a SAM.  It is also most effective if the DA is at a high velocity, at an altitude of around 1k-5k feet over terrain. It is a good idea to drive in a way that leads directly into a notch, cold, or terrain mask in case of failure. If multiple SAMs are launched in proximity to each other (i.e. from a cruiser fleet), driving should be employed FIRST as it can neutralize all missiles in short order without the need for terrain variation.
1.  Identify missile is in visual range and launched
2.  Split-S
3.  Dive straight down.
4.  Level out just above water/terrain, stay as close to terrain as possible.
5.  If missile fails to impact, begin follow-up maneuver and prepare for terminal evasion.
 
4.2.4 - DOPPLER NOTCHING
WHAT: Doppler Notching is a precise maneuver that, if done successfully, can completely break lock from an incoming missile. Doppler notching takes advantage of a radar missile’s tracking system in a way that makes the DA “blend” into the terrain.  Radar guided missiles distinguish their targets from the terrain below them by looking at the doppler shift of the reflection. If a DA is flying below, and perfectly perpendicular to the radar sensor, the missile or sensor will be unable to distinguish it from the passing terrain.
WHEN: Notching can ONLY be used when the missile is significantly above the target. This means it is a good strategy to be used with some slight dragging. It is also good to use with beaming, as notching obligates beaming (unless you are a VTOL). The effectiveness of this maneuver varies based on distance (farther = better), quality of the radar missile, and the source of the radar signals. Notching can only be effective against one missile at a time unless multiple are fired from the same source.  It is good practice to not solely rely on notching when trying to evade.
HOW:
1.  Identify radar source
2.  Fly below radar source if not already
3.  Turn so that the radar source is to your 3 or 9 o’clock.
4.  Fly so that source stays in 3-9 o’clock. (use full afterburner to beam better)
If missile lock is not lost after a few seconds:
1.  Identify missile
2.  Turn so that missile is at your 3 or 9 o’clock.
If missile lock is not lost after a few seconds, abandon the notch attempt and employ other defensive tactics.
 
4.2.5 - GOING COLD
WHAT: Going cold, the cold-defense, or “running away” all refer to the somewhat useful strategy intended to extend the distance a radar guided missile must travel to reach you. When going cold, the DA attempts to put as much distance between him/herself and the missile as quickly as possible. Unlike IR missiles, radar guided weapons are more concerned with personality and thus do not care how hot an aircraft’s ass is, therefore it is strongly advised to use full afterburner during this maneuver. Cold is also a good Terminal Strategy for missiles that are low on energy (going slow).
WHEN: The cold defense should only be used when a missile has just been launched from long range and the source is not closing. Using the cold defense against air superiority fighters or interceptors is not advised, as it can make re-engagement extremely dangerous.  Additionally, the cold defense disengages the DA from the fight, meaning at some point they will have to re-engage. Re-engagement after a cold maneuver should only be done outside of range or line-of-sight of the threat.
HOW:
1.  Identify missile
2.  Turn around
a.  (Optional) & Drag
3.  Go fast
a.  (Optional) & Weave slightly/ “gently beam”
b.  (Optional) & Terrain Mask
If missile goes Pitbull
1.  Dump chaff
2.  Jink and barrel-roll when missile is <1 NM while dumping chaff  
4.2.6 - DRAGGING
WHAT: Dragging is a defensive strategy that exploits the energy relationship between missiles and aircraft. Light, fast, low delta-v missiles struggle to maintain energy in the thick atmosphere at low elevation. By forcing a missile to spend more time at lower elevations, a DA can reduce its energy and defeat it more easily.  Dragging is not always the best strategy, especially if the DA intends to push bandits or avoid a chase/dogfight.
 
WHEN: Dragging is most effective at long ranges and the missile is launched from a high altitude, and the DA plans to go cold. Dragging should not be used as a lone defense and should be used alongside beaming or cold defense maneuvers. Attempting to drag while heading toward the missile will not produce effective results. Additionally, dragging is best used after the DA has launched AMRAAMs and has tracked them to the target near or past their automatic pitbull point.
HOW:
1.  Confirm missile or source is high using HUD ARAD
2.  Perform split-s and level out as low as possible
3.  Go cold or beam/notch with full afterburner
4.  Stay low while performing the maneuver chosen in step 3. 
4.2.7 - HIGH-G MANEUVERING
WHAT:  At the terminal phase of a radar missile, the DA needs to begin to exploit the radar missile’s low maneuverability and potentially low energy. High-G maneuvers of some level are almost always required if a radar missile lock is not broken through terrain masking, driving, notching, or chaff deployment.  In this strategy, the pilot will quickly burn and jink, almost like beaming, but in all 3 dimensions and switching more frequently. The best High-G position for a DA is above the missile and flying at its 2 or 10 o’clock. A DA should be careful of prolonged vertical maneuvers as this greatly increases a missile's impulse advantage. Having good situational awareness helps increase the odds of a missile defeat.
WHEN: Once a missile goes pitbull, the DA’s pilot is advised to squeeze their cheeks. This is not in anticipation for a missile hit but rather to keep from passing out in the 9-G turns he/she is about to make. High-G maneuvers are most effective when the DA is relatively nose-hot to the missile and is using HMD ARAD tracking.
High-G maneuvers should NOT be used if the missile is not both Pitbull, and within 2NM of the DA. This maneuver will greatly reduce the aircraft’s forward velocity which is important for both beaming and cold defenses.
HOW:
1.  Identify incoming missile using HMD ARAD
2.  Confirm Missile is Pitbull (missile alert flash, red “M” circle on RWR)
3.  Confirm Missile is close (can visualize lateral motion on HMD ARAD or close in RWR)
4.  Make rapid rolls to align with turn vectors to insure positive G.
5.  Swerve at 6-9 G’s with each turn lasting between 2 and 5 seconds  
6. Once visual on the missile’s engine/body can be made, perform the following maneuvers.
a.  If missile is below, climb slightly and place missile at 2-3 or 9-10 o’clock, invert to level off just as missile passes above or below
b.  If missile is above, dive sharply into a beam or head-on. Barrel-roll if possible
c.  If neither option is immediately applicable, beam hard and do a corck-screw barrel-roll or Immelmann
7.  Utilize Barrel rolls and Split-S maneuvers.
8.  Do not repeatedly make turns that reduce airspeed.
9.  Avoid missile as it passes
 
If you hear an explosion after missile merge
1.  Confirm no other missile threats are present
2.  Check Engine RPM
3.  Visually assess control surfaces for damage
See Page 50 for emergency checklist.


 
COUNTER-ENGAGEMENT
WHAT: IR guided missiles such as the IRIS, and to a lesser extent AIM-9, can lock, seek, and destroy large SAM’s that have not burnt out their fuel. By flying toward the missile in a predictive manner, a DA can shoot down an incoming SAM with their own IR guided ordinance. Counter-engaging a missile is a somewhat risky strategy but can be very effective when performing SEAD missions.  
WHEN: Counter-Engaging should only be attempted against SAMs, and preferably larger models that burn fuel for a much longer. This method is highly effective when the DA’s mission involves destruction of the launch source and is at a relatively high altitude (SAM has less velocity having had to climb). This is also good when multiple SAM’s are launched at the DA, as IR missiles can quickly be launched in succession.


HOW:
1.  Identify SAM direction
2.  Fly level and straight, do not beam or deviate.
3.  Make sure the SAM is nose-hot between your 11 and 1 o’clock.
4.  Use HMCS slaved IR and visually acquire SAM.
5.  Launch IR missile once high tone is acquired
6.  Turn toward SAM if possible.
7.  Avoid debris after IR missile destroys SAM. 


















________________
4.3 - MISSILE EVASION: IR-GUIDED


OPERATION OF IR-GUIDED MISSILES:
IR-Guided air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, commonly referred to as “heat seekers,” acquire their targets by locking on to the infrared radiation (heat) of the target aircraft, usually the engine(s). Due to this, they have a relatively short range. Most, if not all, IR-guided missiles are all-aspect, meaning that they can acquire a lock from all aspects of a plane, not just the rear, where the engine(s) are located. If there are multiple targets in a close area, the missile will lock on the strongest (warmest). This means that they can be easily evaded by idling the engine(s) and dumping flares. The missile will lock on to the stronger heat signature of the flares and strike them instead of the aircraft.


EVASION:
                  1. Set throttle to IDLE
                  2. Turn to the 9 o’clock or 3 o’clock of the missile (if possible)
                  3. Dive or climb depending on current airspeed
                  4. Dump flares

Afterwords


Freedomplaza:
The writing of this manual has been an amazing experience and, (in my opinion) has greatly improved my own writing skill. I, along with the rest of the team, truly hope that you find this manual helpful, and, if this is your introduction to VTOL VR, go on to enjoy and play the game. I cannot understate how much all of the members of the team have helped me with this, some of us even went from random strangers on the internet to friends! Also, a huge thanks to BahamutoD for making VTOL VR such a great game, without you, literally none of this would’ve been possible. Again, thanks to all of the other people working on this with me and BahamutoD. Thanks for reading this far :)!


Quantify:
Wowee. Didn’t expect this to become such an incredible project. 
Working on this manual with the team has been an awesome experience. I’ve learnt a lot more about the Wasp in doing so, and knowing that new players will benefit from this manual; well, it’s fulfilling to say the least. Ultimately, I worked on this with one goal in mind;
...that the readers of this manual, new or old, fall in love with the game itself. I know I certainly have!
A lot of work has been put into this. Both by myself and Freedomplaza, not to mention the rest of the team, Crushfruits and TheFalcon for making visuals for the manual, and Nebriv for creating a telemetry mod to allow us to further understand the Wasp’s flight mechanics, and many others, and they did it all out of their own heart, because they loved this project and wanted to contribute.
And to everyone else, BahamutoD for creating a wonderful game from the ground up, the community for providing helpful advice, and you, the reader, for providing your time in reading this manual, trudging your way through 82 long, detailed pages, thanks!
