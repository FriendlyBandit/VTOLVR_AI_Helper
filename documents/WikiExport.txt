The '''AGM-114''' is a weapon available to the [[AV-42C]] and [[AH-94]]. It is a versatile laser-guided Air-to-Ground Missile designed with Close Air Support tactics in mind. One rack contains four missiles each, making it easy to bring many of these missiles into battle, and is much lighter than a rack of [[AGM-65]]s.

== Usage ==
The missile is not a fire-and-forget weapon system. A target must be designated by the deploying aircraft's TGP and kept on target until impact. Maneuvering too unpredictably could cause the TGP to reach its gimbal limit during flight; this will divert the missile's course elsewhere and cause it to miss its target. This restriction makes it nonviable for use in areas with heavy air defenses, but it is still useful against other ground targets, especially when one's deployment budget is an issue. Note that the target can be changed while the AGM-114 is in flight if the TGP is set to a different target before impact; remember to take the missile's maneuverability into account and do not attempt this late in the missile's flight path. During the night time, with NVGs active, the MARK button on the [[Targeting Pod (TGP)|TGP]] will allow you to visualize the laser, giving you a way to track where the missile will impact. Bear in mind that enemies will also be able to see this laser if they have NVGs on, though.

The AGM-126 is a lightweight, short-range Anti-Radiation Missile. It is designed to work in conjunction with a fighter's [[MFCD|ARAD]] systems to home in on a radar-emitting target with pinpoint accuracy.  It is notable for being lightweight, fast, and very maneuverable, much like the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], allowing it to quickly maneuver to targets and hit them before they can respond. Any ship can hold up to three AGM-126s on a single rack, allowing them to be equipped in bulk for a rudimentary SEAD loadout. Unlike its counterparts, the AGM-126 has a very wide lock-on arc, and can engage further off-bore than any other Anti-Radiation missile, making it useful for striking secondary targets while flying over an enemy radar emplacement.

===''"Small anti-tank missiles with advanced optics, 'fire and forget', and smart self-targeting technology. Can be fired without line of sight to the designated target point, and will acquire hostile targets automatically." -- In-Game Description''===

The AGM-145 Ballista is a small optically-guided anti tank Air-to-Ground Missile available to the [[F-45A]] and the [[AH-94]]. These missiles use an onboard optical guidance system instead of laser designation, thus making it a fire-and-forget missile. It also has Lock On After Launch (LOAL) functionality, which allows it to be fired without line of sight to a target. This combination of features allows the deploying aircraft to designate targets from afar and fire at them from behind cover, allowing it to employ stealth tactics to hit targets from behind hills or other coverage.

The '''AGM-161''' is a long-range GPS-guided cruise missile available to the [[F/A-26B]] and the [[F-45A]]. Its cousin, the [[AGM-89 Anti-ship Cruise Missile]], cannot be reliably deployed against ground targets, and this cruise missile fills that role. The AGM-161 is GPS-guided and is capable of following GPS paths to its targets. This makes the missile very accurate, though—like with [[GBU-38 Bomb|GBU-38s]]—they are unable to be deployed against moving targets as a result. Unlike the AGM-89, the 161 has no alternative terminal mode options; it will always follow the same trajectory and will invert before impact. The AGM-161 should be launched from a medium-high altitude to ensure that it is able to reach its target. If launched too far away from its target, it will start losing energy and become vulnerable to interception by [[Z20x2 Anti-Air Artillery|hostile CIWS]] or Surface-to-Air Missiles.

AGM-161s are very helpful for dealing with fixed targets from long ranges. They can be helpful as an asset in [[Fighter Combat Roles|SEAD]] tactics due to their sheer range and accuracy. If a crucial Fire Control Radar can be identified and targeted from afar (the [[F-45A|F-45A's]] TSD system excels in these tasks), it can be targeted and engaged with a 161 from a safe distance, allowing the deploying aircraft to focus on planning out further engagements against other targets before moving in.[[Category:Armament]]

The AGM-188 is an Anti-Radiation Missile available to the [[AV-42C]]. Although having a shorter range than the [[AGM-88]], it is unique from other Anti-Radiation Missiles due to its unique top-down attack angle in the terminal homing phase. This technique exploits the inability of many SAM fire control radars to target contacts straight above them, making for a highly aggressive and effective SEAD implement.
== Usage ==
The AGM-188 is used through the ARAD page in an aircraft's [[MFCD]]. From here it is recommended to use the HUD option with their visor on the ARAD display to enable visualization of the enemy SAM radars. Once on the ARAD screen, use the SOI button to select the ARAD screen for thumb stick control. You can then use the thumbstick to slew the targeting reticle to the desired radar source and click once to lock it. From there, simply enter the firing arc and range of the locked target. The orange launch authorization lights will illuminate once you are within range and arc. After firing, you should be free to break for evasive maneuvers if needed.

The '''AGM-27''' is a unique weapon available for the [[AH-94]] and [[T-55]] to use. The AGM-27 fires small laser-guided missiles that excel at laying down precision barrages against hostiles at close-range. One rack can contain 7 or 19 missiles each; in comparison to the [[AGM-114|AGM-114,]] the AGM-27 doesn't hit armored targets quite as hard, but they can be brought into battle in much greater quantities, making them ideal for providing air support against [[Small Arms|small-arms]] targets such as light vehicles and [[Infantry]] units.

The '''AGM-65''' is a strategic Air-to-Ground Missile available to the [[AV-42C]], [[F/A-26B]] and [[T-55]]. Unlike the AV-42C's [[AGM-114]], the AGM-65 is a fire-and-forget weapon, meaning attacking aircraft can easily fire at other targets in quick succession or even break off and duck into cover to avoid hostile air defenses. It is also very useful in SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defences) tactics and naval combat; its range and optical-tracking capabilities make it a great asset for things like destroying ship radars from afar and hitting them up close with simpler weapons like [[Hydra 70]]s afterwards to sink them. Be wary of any CIWS turrets near your target, though, as the missile is still vulnerable to being shot down.

The AGM-65 works based on a built-in optical-tracking guidance system, meaning that it's not only fire-and-forget-capable, but it can also automatically adjust to hit moving targets as well, even when TGP lock is lost. The missile will make automatic flight corrections towards both stationary and moving targets. In comparison, GBU-38s and GBU-39s can steer towards a GPS point, but do not have sensors to identify and track a target.

The AGM-65 can destroy [[Bunker A|bunkers.]]
== Deployment ==

# Select a target by turning on the [[Targeting Pod (TGP)|TGP]] and setting it to SOI.
# While holding the flight stick, use the ''thumb stick to ''slew the reticle over the desired target. The reticle will snap to a unit.  
# Trigger Uncage Mode (Double Action): Hold the ''trigger'' down with the aircraft pointed towards the target to uncage the sensor. A circle in the HUD will slew onto the target and the weapon engagement zone bar will appear. If you are within range, the range launch authorization lights will come on.  While continuing to squeezing the trigger, press the ''change weapon'' button and the missile will launch. The AGM-65 is an Air-to-Ground Missile and thus "Rifle" is announced on the radio when the missile is fired.
# Single Action: The previously described trigger hold behavior is now always on. Instead, the trigger is now used to fire the weapon. 
# After launch you are free to break away if needed or fire on other targets. [[Category:Armament]]

The AGM-88 HARM ('''H'''igh-speed '''A'''nti-'''R'''adiation '''M'''issile) is a medium range anti-radiation missile ideal for targeting hostile SAM radars. This missile is exclusively available to the [[F/A-26B]]. It uses a fighter's [[MFCD|ARAD]] systems to target radar sources from afar for long-range engagement. Though they can hit targets from far away, their speed tends to decrease with range, leaving them somewhat vulnerable to interception by [[SAM Launcher]]s or [[Z20x2 Anti-Air Artillery|CIWS turrets.]] 

The AGM-88 is an anti-radiation missile, so when fired, "Magnum" is announced by the pilot. The missile has a simple direct attack geometry as opposed to the top-down attack of its cousin, the [[AGM-188 MARM]].

== Usage ==
The AGM-88 is used by switching an MFCD to the ARAD screen. The HUD mode is recommended to project radiation sources onto your [[Head-Mounted Cueing System (HMCS)|Head-Mounted Cueing System.]] Once on the ARAD screen, use the SOI button to select the ARAD screen for thumb-stick control. You can then use the thumbstick to slew the targeting reticle to the desired radar source and click once to lock it. From there, simply enter the firing arc and range of the locked target. The orange launch authorization lights will illuminate once you are within range and arc. After firing, you should be free to break for evasive maneuvers if desired. 

The philosophy of use for this missile is typically as a stand-off weapon to target enemy long-range SAM radars outside or just within their targeting envelope. The fire-and-forget capability of the missile allows pilots to fire at multiple targets before ducking back into cover in case any SAM radars have targeted them. The AGM-88 is nearly essential when facing enemy destroyers and other long-range naval SAM systems, allowing the player to destroy the radar first and then sink the ship with other munitions. It should also be noted that with the longer range of the AGM-88, its flight time can be somewhat longer in comparison to other missiles. Pilots need to be vigilant to stay outside of the target's radar envelope as much as possible to avoid an engagement until the AGM-88 has time to impact the radar. Using the S-CAM on MSSL mode or the TGP is helpful for this.

The AGM-89 is an aircraft-launched GPS-guided anti-ship cruise missile with folding wings. It has several attack modes and can navigate to a waypoint or along a path. The missile has built-in navigational systems for automatically avoiding terrain or other objects in the way of its flight path. It turns on its radar during its terminal phase (when it's near its final waypoint) to find and home in on a target. Therefore, there is no way to specify a certain ship, or any ground unit, for the missile to hit. There is, although, another cruise missile available, the [[AGM-161]], specifically designed for hitting targets at long range. In the case of either cruise missile, the user should lead the targets' future position so that the target will be within the missile's detection field of view once it enters its terminal phase.
== Attack Modes ==
An attack mode can be chosen in the AGM-89's section on the EQUIP page.

* '''Direct''' - The missile acts like the [[AGM-65]] and flies directly to the terminal waypoint. It will still turn on its radar to search for a ship, so this does not allow it to hit GPS and non-naval targets. This mode is generally somewhat unsafe to use in terms of missile survivability, but it's a good option for when a deploying aircraft doesn't have enough time to set up a complex GPS path to the missile's destination.
* '''Sea-Skim''' - The missile flies within a mere dozen feet of the waterline to evade radar detection. It impacts its target ship along the waterline, intending to sink the ship via a well-placed hull breach. To ensure missile survivability with this mode, line your points up so that the missile impacts its target from their stern; this will give it an edge over their CIWS turrets as they will need more time to turn around and engage the incoming missile.
* '''SSEvasive''' (Sea-Skim Evasive) - This mode is the same as Sea-Skim, but once it nears its terminal phase, it starts swerving along the water's surface to avoid hostile CIWS. This mode is arguably the best option for ensuring that the missile hits its target successfully; the swerving motion tends to strain the lead-tracking algorithms of CIWS turrets, making the missile more likely to dodge them and hit its target. The missile will still impact the target's hull, directly at the waterline, so there's a slim chance that the missile could be ineffective in this mode.
* '''Popup''' - The missile flies in SS Evasive mode, and once it reaches its terminal phase, it propels itself upwards to hit the target's topside superstructure. This mode is arguably the best mode for ensuring target destruction, due to the fact that the outer deck of a ship is typically weaker than the rest of its hull. Even if the cruise missile doesn't sink the ship, it will still deal extreme damage to its radar and/or weapon systems, making it more vulnerable to destruction through alternate means.

== How To Use ==
# The user must first designate a waypoint in the GPS. Using the [[Targeting Pod (TGP)]]'s GPS-S(end) feature could be helpful here. The missile will path towards the highlighted waypoint when first launched. Then, use your NAV MFCD page to designate a path of GPS points towards the missile's destination and enable PATH mode on your GPS page. Make sure to move the GPS point for the missile's final destination to the bottom of the list. 
# Highlight the first point on the missile's path in the GPS page and point the missile's targeting reticle at it. The yellow cockpit lights will illuminate and the reticle will snap to the waypoint to authorize a launch. Pull the trigger on your controller to launch a missile. There is a time delay until it recovers from free fall, but there is no lock out or warning to stop the user from releasing the missile too low as with the [[CBU-97 Bomb]].
# The missile is now completely autonomous. It can be monitored as it appears on the NAV MFCD page as a friendly unit similar to the symbology on the RADAR. You can also use your S-CAM (Spectator Cam) MFCD page to track the missile by putting the S-CAM in Missile (MSSL) mode and selecting the 'Chase' camera option. The TGP cannot lock onto the cruise missile.
# Once at the last (or only) waypoint, the missile will designate a naval target using its built-in radar. It will home in on it using its designated Terminal mode and, if it manages to avoid CIWS, hit the target hard.

|description="The AH-94 (Dragonfly) is a twin-turboshaft attack helicopter with a tandem cockpit for two pilots."}}
The '''AH-94''' ('''Dragonfly''') is a dedicated attack helicopter designed chiefly for air-to-ground combat. It was released on January 6, 2022, as VTOL VR's first [[:Category: Downloadable Content|DLC.]] The AH-94 is known for its high manoeuvrability and responsiveness, allowing it to fill many close-range air support roles on the battlefield.

== Strategy ==
The''' AH-94''' serves best as a close air support (CAS) asset. Its high maneuverability makes it good for sneaking up on ground targets, such as [[SAM Launcher|SAM Launchers]] and [[Tanks]]. The AH-94 is not built for air-to-air combat but has its own [[AIM-92|IR missiles]] for defending against hostile aircraft at close range. The feature that makes this aircraft stand out from the rest is its ground radar. This device is located at the top of the aircraft and can be equipped in the [[AH-94/Hardpoints|Hardpoints]] screen. The location of the ground radar allows the player or players to hover with the radar above an obstacle like a building or mountain and figure out where the enemy positions are. When you lock on to something with the ground radar, the radar will display an image of what it senses. This feature allows the pilot and gunner to classify targets according to their radar cross section.

== Start-Up Procedure ==
# Enable the main battery
# Engage the APU
# Enable all MFDs and the HUD
# Activate interior lights if desired
# Close the cockpit door
# Ensure that Rotor Fold is not active
# Disengage Rotor Brake
# Activate the ''left'' engine Starter
# Increase rotor Power to Idle using the lever on the left
# Wait for the light next to the starter switch to turn off; use this time to set up your MFDs.
# Engage the ''Right'' engine starter, wait for light to turn off
# Increase engine Power to max, wait for Rotor RPS to enter green zone on engine stat display
# Disengage the APU
# Slowly raise the Collective lever to ascend
# Raise landing gears
# Adjust Trim as needed using the flight Collective and Cyclic

== Armament ==
''Main Article:'' [[AH-94/Hardpoints]]

== Cockpit ==
The ''AH-94'' has a tandem cockpit design, with a pilot's seat in the rear and a co-pilot/gunner seat in the front. Both seats allow for the complete operation of the flight controls and weapons systems. Only one crew member can have control of the flight controls at a time, with a designation light displaying who is in control. In singleplayer, it is possible to switch seats to fly from either position. The copilot in singleplayer is present only for decoration and has no actual in-game functionality.

=== AH-94 Cockpit - HUD ===
{{Map:AH-94 Cockpit - HUD}}

=== Copilot Controls ===
In [[Multiplayer]] games, up to two pilots can fly a single AH-94, allowing aircraft functions to be delegated between the two players at will. 

In the copilot's seat, the '''TEDAC''' (TADS <!--Are we really just going to use an acronym before we define it here? Not good practice. Where else in the article could we mention the TADS beforehand?-->Electronic Display And Control) is located in between the two MFDs, allowing for easier interaction with the '''TADS''' (Target Acquisition and Designation Sight) or other manually-operated targeting systems.

The '''AIM-120 AMRAAM''' (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) is a radar-guided Air-to-Air missile available to the [[F/A-26B]]. Its potential range and speed in the air make it an excellent weapon for deployment against distant enemy aircraft. When fired, it relies on the firing aircraft's built-in radar to calculate a lead-pursuit course to its target, allowing it to account for even extremely fast-moving aircraft and adapt more easily to flight maneuvers. Once it gets close enough to its target, approx. 10 seconds before impact, the missile switches to a built-in radar projector to home in on its target ("goes Pitbull") and functions independently of the deploying aircraft's own sensors; this allows it to break off and make evasive maneuvers or even duck into cover to disengage if needed.

Pilots also have the option of enabling ''MADDOG'' firing for the AIM-120 in the EQUIP menu and activate it by holding the trigger for a few seconds.  This allows the missile to be launched without the deploying aircraft locking the target - or even activating its radar at all.  After launch, the missile will immediately begin searching for targets using the built-in radar projector.  Because [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)|RWR]] cues are minimal when the missile is fired this way, it can be a great way to surprise unaware enemies at range. Firing AIM-120s in ''MADDOG'' mode is also a powerful weapon for flushing out enemies hiding behind terrain, as the missile can be launched over the terrain without exposing the deploying aircraft to possible counterattack. The built-in radar projector will maintain lock on the first aircraft it finds. This aircraft may not be the intended target, particularly when launch aircraft tracking is lost prematurely or many aircraft are in close proximity. Additionally, the built-in radar projectors will not distinguish between friend or foe - firing at enemies that have friendly aircraft in close proximity runs the risk of the missile locking onto a friendly aircraft, causing the missile to seek the friendly aircraft out instead. <!--What is the field-of-view for these missiles to lock on by, anyways?-->

The [[F-45A]] uses a slightly more advanced AIM-120 called the '''AIM-120D''' which has a slightly longer boost phase burn, longer Pitbull range, better counter-countermeasure, and slightly better maneuverability when compared to the standard AIM-120 used by the F/A-26B. Additionally, the AIM-120D can be guided to targets based solely on positional data from the F-45A's TSD alone, allowing it to navigate towards a target without a direct radar lock from the deploying aircraft.
<!--== Usage Instructions ==
===F/A-26B===

# Turn on RADAR, and select the RADAR MFCD page.
# Set it as the SOI.
# Use the thumbstick to slew the reticle over enemy craft. Click once to track, double click to lock. You can track multiple targets but only lock one at a time.
# Once a lock has been obtained the missile can be fired. (Ideally while orange launch authorization lights appear).
# You can switch to a track at any time, but keep the target within your radar's scan cone until the missile goes "pitbull" (see below). Once it does you are free to break away.
===F-45A===

#Open your TSD page and set it as your sensor of interest.
#Tap the radar button on the TSD's screen and tap the 'Power' button to activate it.
#Slew the TSD's cursor over a contact, select them, and move them within the radar's tracking cone to lock onto them.
#Once a lock has been established, select your AIM-120s and fire away. You may immediately turn cold, as the F-45A's sensors can track in any direction.

A target must be locked with the aircraft's radar to authorize a launch.  After launch, the user is free to unlock the targeting cursor and choose another target. As long as the target is within the radar's scan cone, the aircraft's radar will continue to guide the missile to the tracked target. Around 10 seconds before impact, the missile will switch to using its own radar, or go "pitbull". At this point, the missile is now functioning independently of the aircraft's radar; this means you can clear your target tracks, duck into cover, or even shut your radar off and the missile will still guide itself to your target.

A labeled estimate of seconds to impact will appear on the left side of the HUD. ''T ''means the missile is relying on the aircraft's sensors to update guidance to target. ''M ''means the missile has gone "pitbull" and is relying on its own radar guidance. This symbology will disappear from the HUD when the missile explodes, or if the target is lost.-->

The '''AIM-7 SARH''' (Semi-Active Radar Homing) is a semi-active radar-guided Air-to-Air missile available only for the [[F/A-26B]]. It's a lower tech version of the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], used in missions where AIM-120s aren't available. Its maximum range and speed in the air are similar to the AIM-120, making it a perfectly decent missile for attacking other airborne threats. When fired, it relies on the firing aircraft's built-in radar to calculate a lead-pursuit course to its target, allowing it to account for fast-moving aircraft and adapt more easily to flight maneuvers. 

When firing the AIM-7 at an enemy radar contact, the deploying aircraft must maintain a hard lock on the designated target at all times while the missile intercepts its target.

Unlike the AIM-120, the AIM-7 can safely be used against enemies with friendly aircraft in close proximity, making it a useful support weapon even when the more advanced missile is available.

The '''AIM-92''' missile is a short-range heat-seeking air-to-air missile exclusive to the [[AH-94]].

Unlike other IR-guided missiles in VTOL VR, the AIM-92 has no customizable deployment options in the EQUIP area. Its deployment method is analagous to the ''Uncaged'' mode in other heat-seeking missiles in the game. To deploy the AIM-92, hold the trigger on the flight stick, point the circling reticle at a nearby air target, wait for the high-pitched tone, and press the weapon switch button to fire.

Unlike the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|standard AIM-9 missiles]], the AIM-9Es require a lock specifically on the target's engines for locking. Additionally, the AIM-9E can only be fired in '''Uncaged''' mode, where the IR seeker rotates around the middle of the screen and fires with the pull of a trigger once tone is acquired.

The '''AIM-9 Sidewinder''' is a short-range, heat-seeking air-to-air missile available for the [[AV-42C]] ,[[F/A-26B]] and the T-55  to utilize. The [[F-45A]] has its own variant of the AIM-9, the '''AIM-9+ Sidewinder''', which has various improvements over the original AIM-9's design. It is designed for close-range air-to-air combat, when [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120s]] would be impractical to utilize. It has strong maneuverability and is capable of tracking and homing in on a target's ambient heat-signature, even from the front or sides.

== Equipment Options ==
The AIM-9 has a number of deployment options that affect the behavior of the targeting reticle, listed below:

*''Caged'' - The missile's targeting reticle points forward at all times, much like the AIM-120's own.
*''Uncaged'' - The targeting reticle circles around the HUD and snaps to the first prominent heat signature it detects.
*''Vertical Scan'' - Similar to Uncaged; instead of circling the center of the HUD, the reticle bobs up and down along the center vertically, snapping to the first heat signature it detects. Useful for dogfights.
*''Head-Track'' - Requires the [[Head-Mounted Cueing System (HMCS)|HMCS]] to be active. The missile's reticle points in the direction the player is looking in, allowing the missile to effectively target enemies at the rear flanks of the deploying aircraft.
*Trig-Uncage - Functions the same as Caged mode until the trigger is pressed, at which point the missile's seeker swaps to Uncage mode in order to find targets. The missile can then be fired by pressing the weapon switch button.

== Use ==
[[File:20190306002329 1.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Rack of 3 AIM-9 missiles.]]
It should be noted that the AIM-9 can be mounted to the outer hard points of the F/A-26B in sets of up to 3 each, giving the pilot up to 6 missiles across only 2 hard points. The AIM-9 can additionally be mounted on other hard points as well, allowing for the setup of a lightweight air-to-air payload if budget is an issue. The AIM-9 is a short range infrared missile, used in dog-fighting and pop-up attacks when radar-guided missiles are no longer practical. When the missile is selected, it will emit a low tone when not targeting a heat signature. Once it identifies a heat signature, its tone will increase; a stronger tone designates a more reliable lock. A predicted intercept point will also be displayed on the HUD, leading the target aircraft when you have obtained a strong lock. The missile has much higher maneuverability than other missiles like the AIM-120, letting it maneuver more sharply to hit its target. It is the cheapest of the Air-to-Air missile family, making it very economical for low budget missions. While the missile can fire and track at extreme angles, aligning your aircraft closer to the predicted impact point and closing range will always improve results. Most fighters are equipped with countermeasure dispensers with flares for evading heat-seeking missiles. The AIM-9 is particularly vulnerable to this, being easily "distracted" by flares launched from the defending aircraft. This can be counteracted somewhat efficiently by launching the missile closer to the target.

''Warning: Please take care when firing any IR missile in close proximity to friendly units. The IR missiles will reliably track whichever heat source is targeted, but if a friendly aircraft passes in front of the missile, the missile's seeker could become confused and target them instead, especially if their heat signature is stronger. Stick to your [[Cannons]] if you are dogfighting near allies.''

== Variants ==
* '''AIM-9+ Sidewinder:''' This variant is available only on the [[F-45A]]. It is an in-between to the AIM-9 and the AIRS-T in terms of range, accuracy and maneuverability. It is mountable on the wing pylons in sets of 1 and the outer internal bays in sets of 2 for a total of 10 missiles.
* '''[[AIM-9E]]:''' This missile variant is a significant downgrade of the now-standard AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. Unlike its more modern cousins, the AIM-9E can only be fired in uncaged mode, and is only capable of locking onto a target's engines, meaning that the deploying aircraft needs to be facing an enemy plane's rear aspect for the 9E's seeker to target it.

<!--[[File:20190306002134 1.jpg|thumb|220x220px|A rack of 3 AIRS-T's.]]-->
The '''AIRS-T''' is a Advanced Short-Range heat-seeking Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) developed mainly as an alternative to the aging [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]. It boasts a number of improvements over the AIM-9, including significantly stronger CM resistance (ability to better discern between flare countermeasures and an actual aircraft), acceleration speed, maneuverability, and overall effective range. It is generally superior in all regards to the AIM-9 and is a better option to utilize if cost and availability aren't immediate issues.

''*In comparison to the AIM-9.''

== Equipment Options ==
Just like with the AIM-9, the AIRS-T has a small variety of different targeting modes that can be configured through a fighter's weapon management MFCD page:
* ''Caged'' - The missile's targeting reticle points forward at all times, much like the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]'s own.
* ''Uncaged'' - The targeting reticle circles around the HUD and snaps to the first prominent heat signature it detects.
* ''Vertical Scan'' - Similar to Uncaged; instead of circling the center of the HUD, the reticle bobs up and down along the center vertically, snapping to the first heat signature it detects. Useful for dogfights.
* ''Head-Track'' - Requires the [[Head-Mounted Cueing System (HMCS)|HMCS]] to be active. The missile's reticle points in the direction the player is looking in, allowing the missile to effectively target enemies at the rear flanks of the deploying aircraft.

== Use ==
It should be noted that the AIRS-T can be mounted to the outer hard points of the F/A-26B in sets of up to 3 each, giving the pilot up to 6 missiles across only 2 hard points. The AIRS-T can additionally be mounted on other hard points as well, allowing for the setup of a lightweight air-to-air payload if budget is an issue.

The AIRS-T is a short range infrared missile, used in dog-fighting and pop-up attacks when radar-guided missiles are no longer practical. When the missile is selected, it will emit a low tone when not targeting a heat signature. Once it identifies a heat signature, its tone will increase; a stronger tone designates a more reliable lock. A predicted intercept point will also be displayed on the HUD, leading the target aircraft when you have obtained a strong lock. The missile has much higher maneuverability than other missiles like the AIM-120, letting it maneuver more sharply to hit its target. The AIRS-T is more expensive than the AIM-9, but a better option in all regards. While the missile can fire and track at extreme angles, aligning your aircraft closer to the predicted impact point and closing range will always improve results. 

Though it's not the missile's main function (and therefore not recommended to utilize), the AIRS-T is capable of targeting and intercepting incoming Surface-to-Air Missiles. This technique is most effective if the SAM is still in its booster stage, when its heat signature is most prominent.

''Warning: Please take care when firing any IR missile in close proximity to friendly units. The IR missiles will reliably track whichever heat source is targeted, but if a friendly aircraft passes in front of the missile, especially if their heat signature is stronger, the missile's seeker could become confused and target them instead. Stick to your [[Cannons]] if you are dogfighting near allies.''

The '''AN/APG-108 Fire Control Radar''' is a specialized optional radar equippable for the [[AH-94]]. Unlike conventional radars on the [[F/A-26B]] or the [[F-45A|F-45A,]] the AH-94's radar has two target-searching modes: ground (GND) and air (AIR). It allows for quick target acquisition behind cover, allowing you to lock a target and either send GPS coordinates--using the GPS-S(end) button--or slew it to the TADS directly.

=== ''"A stealthy air-superiority fighter. Internal weapon bays and a single thrust-vectored afterburning engine" - Mission Editor Description'' ===
The ASF-33 is one of the less common fighters in the enemy fleet, designed with stealth and air superiority in mind. It has an internal weapons bay for improved stealth and aerodynamics, allowing it not only a higher default Thrust to Weight Ratio than the [[ASF-30]], but also a slight resistance to hostile radar locks. It can optionally equip two [[External Fuel Tanks]] on its wing pylons, sacrificing its stealth capabilities for much greater flight range.

Similar to the basic ASF-30, the ASF-33 is capable of taking off from and landing at [[NFP Carrier|carriers.]]

== Armament ==

** 4000L External Drop Tank - "A 4000 liter detachable external fuel tank."*
''*Not equipped by default; can be attached if desired.''

== Trivia ==

* The ASF-33 was originally known simply as "Drone Fighter". This caused some confusion among players where the [[Manta UCAV]] was concerned due to its modern status as a "Drone fighter."

[[File:ASF58 Profile.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]

=== ''"A long range stealthy air-superiority fighter. High capacity internal weapon bays and dual thrust-vectored afterburning engine." - In game description.'' ===
The ASF-58 is a dual-thruster afterburning engine Air Superiority Fighter, reputable as being the most powerful class of Air Superiority Fighter in the enemy fleet. It is designed with stealth and air superiority in mind. It has a very smooth frame and an internal weapons bay, giving it a strong resistance to radar detection and locks. This plane has a default Thrust to Weight Ratio of 1.43, the highest of any fighter in the game. It is also optionally capable of equipping [[External Fuel Tanks]], allowing it to sacrifice its stealth and maneuverability for extended flight range. Unlike the other ASF models, the ASF-58 lacks a launch bar or arrestor hooks, making it unable to safely deploy from or land at [[NFP Carrier|carriers.]] 

== Armament ==
All of the ASF-58's weapons are internally-stowed, similarly to the [[F-45A]]. It is identifiable on the [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)]] as ''F+.''

The '''AV-42C''' (also known as the '''Kestrel''') is a Tilt-jet VTOL Attack/Transport aircraft available to the Allied faction. It was the first aircraft implemented in VTOL VR and largely serves as the game's namesake. Its tilt-jet VTOL flight setup gives it a surprising amount of mobility in the field. It is capable of taking off from and landing on both landing strips and helipads alike. Though it does not have as many weapon slots as the [[F/A-26B]], and is more limited in the kinds of armaments it is capable of deploying, it makes up for this disparity with the already-formidable and versatile armaments it can equip. Coupled with its VTOL capabilities, the AV-42C can be a strong close air support asset when dealing with surface targets due to its high mobility.

Additionally, the AV-42C has full [[Aircraft Carrier|carrier]] [[Carrier Takeoff and Landing|deployment]] compatibility; it has both a launch bar for carrier takeoffs and an arrestor hook for carrier landings. It also includes a refueling port near the top of the aircraft to facilitate [[Aerial Refueling]], thereby increasing its overall maximum flight range.

== Strategy ==
The AV-42C's VTOL capability means that it flourishes in the field of air-to-ground combat. It is capable of equipping a myriad of missiles and bombs across its pylons, allowing it to fill a wide variety of ground-based combat roles. In horizontal flight, the AV-42C functions well as a strike aircraft; it can launch missiles at and drop bombs on targets at high speeds before going back around to make further passes. In vertical flight, however, it becomes a formidable asset in close air support tactics; its stabilized vertical flight allows it to make clean strafing runs against ground targets while maintaining a strong positional advantage against threats such as [[Infantry MANPADS|MANPADS units]] on the ground.

The biggest drawback of the AV-42C is that it remains somewhat vulnerable to hostile interceptor aircraft. As far as maneuverability goes, VTOL aircraft generally aren't very nimble in the skies, so one should be extra careful in the presence of enemies with radar-guided missiles available. Additionally, unlike aircraft like the F/A-26B, the AV-42C has no onboard radar and can only equip heat-seeking missiles, making it a nonviable option for engaging hostile aircraft in an offensive posture.

== Transport Capability ==
The AV-42C is uniquely able to load up and transport up to 8 allied [[infantry]] units at a time. There is a switch in the right side of the AV-42C's cockpit for controlling the side doors for the passenger compartment. Passenger transport is facilitated through objectives and triggers in the [[Mission Editor]]. To receive passengers, the AV-42C must be landed and have its doors open. From there, passengers will load into the AV-42C and can be transported to other destinations and let out the same way they would be let in. Each soldier loaded into the AV-42C adds {{Tooltip|90kg|~198 lbs}} of mass to the aircraft while loaded.

== Reaction Control System ==
The Reaction Control System is a system unique to the AV-42C. The system assists with adjusting the yaw, pitch, and roll of the aircraft using the four thrusters located on the fuselage. This system is very helpful at controlling the aircraft while in low speeds or while hovering. The options are as follows:

* '''OFF:''' Disables the Reaction Control System. Flight stick input and rudder pedal input will not adjust the attitude of the aircraft while in low speeds or while hovering.
* '''AUTO:''' Activates the Reaction Control System up to ~125 knots, at which the system will deactivate. 
* '''ON:''' Keeps the Reaction Control System active at all times. Not recommended due to diminishing advantages while flying at higher speeds and excessive fuel usage.

[[File:Tanker1.jpg|thumb|336px|An F/A-26B refueling from a KC-49.]]Aerial refueling is the process of refueling an aircraft without landing. This can be useful for sustaining long-range missions or when taking off with minimal fuel to facilitate the usage of heavier loadouts. There are two vehicles in the game that can facilitate aerial refueling:
* [[KC-49 Tanker]]: A converted airliner fitted with a ventral refueling boom. Includes a set of Pilot Directional Indicator (PDI) lights for assistance with position guidance.
* [[MQ-31]]: A carrier-launchable drone equipped with a refueling boom like the KC-49. Arguably more difficult to refuel from due to the lack of a PDI light system and a lower boom gimbal range.

==Guide==
Aerial refueling is generally a difficult task for untrained pilots. It involves knowing how to move relative to another aircraft and being able to hold a specific position for extended time periods with very little room for error. As such, practice and patience are key to being able to make a successful refuel in the air.

Your first priority is going to be to know where your aircraft's refueling port is located:
* [[AV-42C]]: The port is located above the cockpit. Somewhat tricky to refuel with, as it can be difficult to know where to place the aircraft while in flight.
* [[F/A-26B]]: The port is located in front of the cockpit. Generally the easiest to refuel, and an excellent aircraft for starting out with.
* [[F-45A]]: The port is located to the right side of the cockpit. Arguably the hardest to refuel due to the added complication of having to place your aircraft slightly to the left of the tanker.
From there, follow these instructions to refuel with the most stable approach:
# Flip your Fuel Port switch.
# Move to ~50 meters behind the refueling aircraft.
# Adjust your speed until your distance to the aircraft remains constant for at least 3 seconds.
# Slowly increase your speed to meet up with the tanker. '''The slower your approach is, the better. Do not rush unless you are at critically-low fuel levels.'''
# Assume a position just underneath and behind the tanker. If your fuel port is open, the boom will automatically connect to your aircraft.
# (KC-49 ONLY) Follow the PDI guide lights underneath the tanker to hold a more stable position. If both lights are green, you're in an optimal position.
# Hold position, adjusting throttle and angle as needed, until your desired fuel level is reached. Ensure you do not overcorrect with your maneuvers.

== Air Density ==
Air density with altitude is simulated. At a higher altitude, air gets thinner. Engines have a harder time producing thrust as they get choked for air, and there is less drag. Overall, this leads to a balance where aircraft are be able to fly faster at a high altitude with the same throttle setting than at sea level. Wings produce less lift in thinner air, so increasing nose up attitude or speed is needed.

== Supersonic Flight ==
Any aircraft that reaches a speed of Mach 1 will have a vapor cone effect applied to it. This signifies that an aircraft is flying at supersonic speeds. Sonic boom effects are also simulated in VTOL VR, which can be heard when flying past the camera in certain S-CAM configurations.

== Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR) ==
The thrust to weight ratio of an aircraft is critical for understanding its overall maneuverability. It is a measurement of the amount of thrust provided by the engines compared to the amount of combined mass or weight of the aircraft that the thrust has to push. This factors in every aspect of an aircraft's payload, mostly aircraft weight and fuel storage. If your TWR is over 1.0, this means that your aircraft will be able to climb vertically, as the thrust is greater than the mass.   

A TWR of 1.5 means that your engines can push 1.5 times your current combined aircraft mass. The .5 difference is what will make you accelerate straight up.  An aircraft with less than 1.0 will need wing lift to maintain altitude and cannot go vertical. When operating VTOL aircraft like the [[AV-42C]], the TWR ''must'' be greater than 1.0 for vertical take-off and landing. If it is not, the Kestrel has to be used in a traditional aircraft mode and use lift from air under the wings to take off and land. TWR constantly changes as fuel depletes and weapons are fired. Jettison any unnecessary equipment, fuel tanks, or weapon racks to increase your TWR. It also plays into horizontal acceleration and turn radius. Higher TWR values are essential for air-to-air combat and missile evasion.  

== Other Unsimulated Effects ==
* Ground effect
* Turbulence
* There is optional experimental wind

Airbases are the main implement for housing and deploying aircraft when needed. They consist of a long runway, a command area with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower, and multiple tents and hangar bays for storing incoming aircraft. Fighters can take off from airbases as well as land there to rearm and refuel. 

Airbases are added into maps as static objects in the [[Map Editor]] and their default names can be configured by changing the object's name. Placing an airbase down will automatically flatten the terrain underneath it to give it flat ground to work with. When a map is loaded into the [[Mission Editor]], its airbases can be configured through the Bases tab. This allows two main properties to be adjusted: the airbase's displayed name and its allegiance. By default, an airbase will have the name denoted in the Map Editor and its allegiance will be allied. The allegiance of an airbase determines who gets to use it for rearming and refueling. AI units will never land at an airbase whose allegiance aligns with an enemy faction. The allegiance property can be changed mid-game via [[Event Actions]], allowing scenarios of airbases being taken over to be created. 

Airbases have fully-functional ATC towers which can be communicated with to request takeoff and landing clearance. Although this is not an enforced requirement for taking off or landing, it can help players avoid traffic conflicts, such as other aircraft on the runway or disrupting an AI aircraft's taxi path, by placing them within a queue to allow them to maneuver in a controlled, non-disruptive fashion. This can be facilitated through the COMMS [[MFCD]] page or with the [[Voice Commands|voice command]] system. 

There is only one uniquely designed airbase in the game, that being the airbase at [[Akutan]]. The map was custom-modeled (having been created well before the Map Editor existed), so the airbase there has two runways and a somewhat unorganized layout of tents and helipads. ATC functionality is unchanged aside from the possibility of being assigned the left or right runway for takeoffs and landings.

=== ''"Large naval aircraft carrier. Can be set as the spawn point for the player and certain AI aircraft." -- Mission Editor description'' ===
This is the main aircraft carrier for the allied fleet. It has 9 spawn points on its deck which can fit [[AV-42C]]s, [[F/A-26B]]s, [[F-45A]]s, and nonplayable [[MQ-31]] aerial refueling drones. It has four launch catapults on its deck for safely launching CTOL aircraft; two are located towards the bow while the other two are at the middle of the deck, located portside from the bridge. It also has an arrestor-bar-based landing system on its rear deck for controlled horizontal aircraft landings. It can be difficult to land on a carrier, though, especially while it's moving, so the carrier also comes with an Improved Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (IFLOLS), located just off portside on the top deck for assistance with glide slope tuning. See the page on [[Carrier Landing]] for more information.

As for its defenses, it has a small set of CIWS and SAM turrets around its hull for close-in defense against hostile aircraft and even incoming missiles. Unlike most naval ships, the carrier doesn't have a Vertical Launch System or any sort of radar-based weaponry, so bringing an [[Allied Cruiser]] or two along should be done when deploying it directly into battle for optimal tactical flexibility.

The enemy faction also has their own carrier: the [[NFP Carrier]].

There are several different roles a fighter can play in the battlefield, depending on what they are assigned to do. Those such roles will be listed on this page.

== Loadout Roles ==
* Fighter - A term applying to fighters configured for air-to-air attack roles. Generally implies a setup consisting mainly of Radar and Heat-Seeking missiles for dispatching enemy aircraft.
* Striker - A term applying to fighters configured for general air-to-surface roles. Typically implies a setup oriented around the use of AGMs (air to ground missiles).
* Bomber - A term applying to fighters or jets configured for bombing runs. It generally implies the deployment of [[B-11]]s or [[HB-106]]s into battle, but it could also apply to existing ships with loadouts consisting mainly of (un)guided bombs.

=== Ground Assault ===
Fighters in this role, generally strikers, are expected to arm for combat against hostile ground units, such as tanks and anti-air installations. Fighters in this role will generally focus on the use of AGMs and bombs to strike various targets on the ground. The [[AV-42C]] is generally suitable for close combat or close air support (supporting ground troops), while the [[F/A-26B]] and [[F-45A]] have better long-range weaponry for more dangerous ground assault tasks, such as destroying command centers or other units that tend to shoot back.

=== SEAD ===
SEAD stands for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses, and is a role that encompasses combat against hostile radar setups. This is a somewhat dangerous role for fighters, as it encompasses the diversion and evasion of hostile radar missiles. Fighters in this role will generally equip Anti-Radiation Missiles (ARMs) and/or [[AGM-161]] Standoff missiles to hit hostile radars from long range. This can also be accomplished by using stealth techniques to get closer than normally possible. 

=== Naval Assault ===
This role encompasses the task of assaulting hostile naval ships, generally with the goal of their complete destruction. Fighters in this role will commonly equip ARMs to deal with hostile radars and [[AGM-89 Anti-ship Cruise Missile]]s for long-range ship destruction. Alternatively, [[Hydra 70]]s can also fill the role of ship destruction, as a few well-placed rockets to an enemy bridge will usually sink the ship on their own.

=== Combat Air Patrol ===
Combat Air Patrol, or CAP, is simple: fly around and attack hostile fighter squadrons on sight. Fighters taking on CAP roles should generally focus on air-to-air-oriented loadouts composed of Radar missiles and Heat-Seeking missiles. Fighters in these roles should generally bring more Radar missiles than Heat-Seekers because fighters will generally be farther away from their targets more often.

[[File:Akutan1.jpg|thumb|316x316px|A bird's-eye view of Akutan from the southeast.]]
Akutan is a default map available in VTOL VR. It consists of a large island with a single airbase, multiple cities, and a smaller island to the southwest. This map was designed well before the [[Map Editor]] was implemented in the game; as such, it not only contains uniquely-modeled features, such as its custom airbase and city buildings but also cannot be accessed for modification through the Map Editor program. It can, although, still be utilized within the [[Mission Editor]]. It is most widely known for being the map where the [[AV-42C]]'s campaign, [[The Island|''The Island'']]'','' takes place.

Being VTOL VR's default map, it completely bypasses the map generation phase that other map files require for in-game usage. This makes it an incredibly useful map for naval combat; simply move your units out far away from the island for a blank area for sea combat.

==='''Points of Interest'''===

* A unique airbase with two runways on the southern coast.
** It is flanked by a group of tall hills, making air defense easier.
* Four small cities along the coastline.
** One city has a marked hospital building (designated with a blue cross symbol) with a helipad on top.
* A dormant volcano in the western area.
* Multiple tunnels leading through the mountains.

''Arctic Assault'' is one of the Quick Play missions available to the [[AH-94]]. It involves spotting targets for [[Rocket Artillery Truck|allied rocket artillery]] and dealing with remaining hostiles in the area.

Like with the rest of the AH-94's Quick Play missions, this mission may also be played with other players in multiplayer. Two helicopters can be used in multiplayer, with each helicopter supporting their own pilot and gunner slots.

OBJECTIVES:
* Spot an enemy artillery group west of the FOB
** Destroy what remains after allied artillery makes its salvos
* Destroy a hostile tank group moving on your FOB
* Spot another artillery group to the north
** Destroy what remains after allied artillery makes its salvos
* Neutralize a hostile SAM grid to the northwest
* RTB

== Walkthrough ==
=== Recommended Loadout ===
For this mission, it is recommended to equip a loadout containing weaponry for dealing with targets at range. The bulk of your targets in this mission will be stationary targets, so [[GBU-39 SD Bomb#GBU-39ER|GBU-39ER]] bombs can work very well for dealing with them at range. Additionally, pilots should make good use of the [[AGM-145 Ballista|AGM-145]] missiles during this mission; these will help you deal with moving targets and other hostile air defenses from behind cover, which will be a valuable tactic during the mission. Finally, pilots can make very good use of the [[AN/APG-108]] search radars during this mission to seek out ground targets in the area. Spotting targets with the radar and ducking back into cover is an excellent strategy to use for avoiding hostile air defenses and planning out attack runs.
=== Overview ===
You will start the mission at an allied FOB between your airbase and enemy territory. Your aircraft will be ready to fly the moment you spawn in, so get in the air as soon as you can. Once in the air, you can watch the allied rocket artillery make its initial salvos before moving to your first waypoint. You will notice an enemy bunker being assaulted by friendly [[Infantry]] in the area; fly past this landmark and ascend past the mountain ridge ahead of them. Once at the peak of the ridge, engage your aircraft's Hover Autopilot and move to the front seat of the aircraft. Open up the TADS on your TEDAC (center MFD), press the PWR button if the TADS isn't already active, and press the WPT button to center the camera on the enemy position. The moment the TADS snaps to an enemy target, the allied artillery group will send in two more volleys to hit the group. It is also recommended to keep the Objectives (OBJ) screen open on another MFD to keep track of how many enemies are remaining in the area. Once the two salvos hit the enemy artillery group, it will be your turn to clear out any remaining targets in the area. It is recommended to use the GBU-39ER bombs against these targets if possible, as you will want to save the bulk of your AGM-145s for later on in the mission. If you are unclear on where any remaining targets are, you can turn on your helicopter's ground radar to search for remaining targets. Make sure not to get too close to the artillery group, as their machine guns can be deceptively dangerous against your aircraft.

Once the first artillery group has been cleared out, you will be tasked with destroying a tank platoon that broke off from the artillery group shortly before the attack started. They will have moved south past the mountain ridge you crossed earlier. Activate your ground radar and move to intercept them before they can hit the allied artillery group. An [[IRAPC]] will be moving with the tank platoon to provide fire support for them; maintaining a safe distance, locate the IRAPC at the rear of the tank platoon and destroy it using an AGM-145 from afar. Once the IRAPC has been destroyed, destroy 2-3 more of the enemy tanks from afar using AGM-145s, and then move closer to destroy the rest of them with your aircraft's main cannon. Either of the cannons are equally capable of dealing with the enemy tanks, but make sure your helicopter is close enough to the tank platoon to avoid spread-related accuracy penalties.

Having destroyed the tank platoon, you will be tasked with helping the allied artillery group deal with the hostile emplacements at the next waypoint. This one will be more challenging than the first group due to the presence of stronger SAM-based air defenses at the waypoint. Moreover, a grid of [[MAD-4 Radar|MAD-4]]-based long range SAM launchers are located to the northwest of the second group, so you will need to stay low and make good use of terrain coverage to avoid getting locked onto. You can deal with those MAD-4s later on. For now, approach your next waypoint from the southeast and use your radar to seek out enemy targets. You can peek out from behind cover periodically to sweep for targets near the waypoint; just don't stay out of cover for too long, as the SAM defenses in the area could get a bead on you then. Like with the first objective, spotting a target will cue the allied artillery group to lay down two salvos on the enemy emplacement. Once they hit the encampment, you will be cleared to move in and take out the surviving enemy units. If the enemy SAM radar near the waypoint hasn't been destroyed, you will need to mark it with your TADS and fire an AGM-145 at it from behind terrain coverage.

After destroying the second enemy encampment, you will be tasked with performing SEAD work against a SAM grid to the northwest. Like before, you will need to make good use of your AGM-145s to destroy the hostile SAM radars in the area. Make good use of terrain coverage, designate targets using your ground radar and TADS, and destroy them using your remaining AGM-145s and your trusty main cannon. You will only need to destroy the SAM radars in the area; a pair of bombers will be approaching to mop up the remaining enemy forces. Once all of the MAD-4 Radars have been destroyed, the allied bombers will come in to deal with the remaining enemy units in the AO and you will be cleared to return to base.

=== ''"A smaller carrier for VTOL and STOVL aircraft." -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The Assault Carrier is a more specialized carrier available to the allied fleet. It is designed to accommodate VTOL and STOVL aircraft, specifically the [[F-45A]] and the [[AV-42C]]. Unlike the regular allied [[Aircraft Carrier]], the Assault Carrier does not have any launch catapults or arrestor bars, as they are not required for the aircraft that the carrier is designed for. It can hold 6 aircraft, 2 in front of the superstructure and 4 behind it. The F-45A will automatically take off vertically.

There are three common '''autopilot''' features with one unique autopilot mode for each playable aircraft. The player may disable a mode by pressing the OFF button in their autopilot section or by applying strong throttle and/or flight stick inputs against the autopilot (for relevant modes). The three common autopilot methods are NAV, ALT, and HDG autopilot:
* '''NAV''': ''"Navigation Autopilot"'' - This mode vectors the aircraft directly towards the current waypoint. If the player has created a path in the NAV and GPS pages, NAV autopilot will also fly that path for them. '''NOTE:''' Using the NAV mode to navigate to a waypoint under 5000 ft ASL will set the altitude to approximately 5000 ft ASL. If the waypoint is above 5000 ft ASL, the autopilot will match the waypoint's altitude. Using this mode may not be desirable when navigating through mountainous terrain. 

* '''ALT''': ''"Altitude Autopilot"'' - This mode holds the current altitude using pitch. The plane will automatically pitch up or down to maintain altitude when banking, making this useful for manually orbiting or skimming close to the sea. 

* '''HDG''': ''"Heading Autopilot"'' - Holds the current heading using roll and yaw. The player may provide pitch input without overriding this setting. 
There are also three unique autopilot modes, one for each aircraft:
* '''HVR''': ''"Hover Autopilot"'' - This mode is unique to the [[AV-42C]], and can only be toggled when its engines are 90 degrees up. The autopilot will attempt to cancel out any horizontal movement and the player can move the stick in any direction without the autopilot turning off. This is useful for steady vertical landings; get close to your landing area without the autopilot on and use the HVR autopilot to make a soft, controlled landing. It's especially helpful when time isn't an urgent factor in your landing.
* '''SPD''': ''"Speed Autopilot"'' - This mode, exclusive to the [[F/A-26B]], will allow the computer to control the aircraft's thrust to hold the aircraft at a desired speed. This can be very helpful for staying in formation with other squad members and can also help with aerial refueling. Speed can be adjusted using the SPD knob located on the analog air speed indicator. The white number indicates the current speed and the green number indicates the set speed. 
* '''VCAP''': ''"Vertical Control Autopilot"'' - This autopilot mode is exclusive to the [[F-45A]], and is arguably one of the most complex ones. It is used for easing vertical takeoffs and landings. It alters the roles of the throttle and the flight stick; in this mode, the throttle controls your forward and backward movement, while your flight stick controls your ascent/descent rate (with forward and backward input, respectively). An F-45A must have a Thrust to Weight Ratio greater than 1.04 to use this feature properly. See its section in the F-45A's article for more information.

== Using multiple autopilot modes ==
The autopilot modes couple to other avionics and controls.

=== Common autopilot modes ===
The ALT autopilot mode can be used with either the HDG or NAV autopilot mode to maintain desired altitude and direction. Adjustments can be made in the F-45A by using the autopilot menu at the top right part of the screen, and in the F/A-26B by using the AP ALT panel and the HDG knob located on the [https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/File:HSI_with_ILS.png Horizontal Situational Indicator]. 

=== Unique autopilot modes ===

* '''AV-42C:''' Using the HVR mode and the ALT mode allows the AV-42C to essentially translate through space without the coordination needed for a manually flown helicopter. The player may control the ascend or descend rate using the throttle lever, and control horizontal movement using the flight stick at any time without turning off the autopilot modes. 
* '''F/A-26B:''' The SPD mode can be used in addition to the ALT + HDG/NAV modes to maintain a desired speed along with a desired altitude and direction. Using these three autopilot modes in conjunction can be very helpful when trying to stay in formation with a squadron.

=== ''"A supersonic strategic bomber. High payload and fuel capacity" -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The main specialized bomber aircraft of the allied faction. This jet is designed with high-payload tactical carpet bombing in mind. It can reach very high speeds in the air, though its lack of maneuverability makes it somewhat vulnerable to hostile SAM sites and other fighters.

== Strategy ==
This bomber has a wide variety of weapons and is designed with low-altitude bombing runs in mind. It generally flies low and fast to avoid radars, making it apt for hit-and-run tactics. Its weapon variety also makes it a valuable asset in naval combat, giving it plenty of ways to hit enemy ships.

''Bay Assault'' is one of the Quick Play missions available to the [[F-45A]]. It involves the player's squadron destroying priority targets in enemy territory during a full-scale assault.

OBJECTIVES:
* Protect the carriers
* Destroy priority targets
** [[Rocket Artillery Truck|Rocket Artillery Trucks]]
** [[HB-106 Bomber|Hostile bomber jets]]
** [[Bunker A|Command and Control (C2) bunkers]]
** [[ASF-58|Stealth fighters]]
* RTB

== Walkthrough ==
You and your squadron will start off from an [[Assault Carrier]] and will need to take off as soon as possible to deal with the hostile forces attacking the fleet. You will then receive objectives to destroy four groups of hostiles: a group of rocket artillery trucks pelting the fleet from behind a hill, several bombers at one of the airbases, the two bunkers that the enemy is using as a command center, and several stealth fighters at another airbase in the map. You are technically allowed to tackle the objectives in any order you desire, but the order provided in this guide gives you the best chance of removing the biggest threats before they can become problematic. Another hindrance also remains: a large enemy fleet in the bay, including multiple [[NMSS Cruiser|NMSS Cruisers]]. There will also be a number of SAM defenses along the coastline where the enemy fleet launches from. There will be other fighter groups flying out to take care of these threats, so you should be safe to focus on your own objectives.

Your first targets are going to be the closest ones: the artillery trucks. Right before you crest the hills between you and them, you will receive a GPS path on group MSN 3 denoting the approximate locations of the targets. Immediately after you pass the hills, open your EOTS (targeting pod) tab and activate your [[Head-Mounted Cueing System (HMCS)]] to search for the targets. There will be four artillery trucks randomly scattered along the corner of the landscape; considering their large size, distinctive heat signature, and the prevalence of the smoketrails from launched rockets, finding them shouldn't be too difficult. There may also be an [[IRAPC]] in the area for air defense, so you should destroy that vehicle as well if it is present. It should be very easy to destroy all of the trucks with a single rack of [[AGM-145 Ballista|AGM-145s]] or [[GBU-53 Advanced SD Bomb|GBU-53s]]. Once all of the artillery trucks have been eliminated (command will inform you once this is done), immediately vector west towards the enemy's airbase to take down their bombers. Remember to fly low to avoid getting locked onto by the long-range missiles from the enemy fleet.

A number of bomber jets will be cued up to take off from the airbase, and depending on how long it took for you to destroy the rocket artillery trucks earlier, one or two may already be in the air. You will need to fly low as you approach the airbase to avoid its SAM grid. Target the SAM radar atop the ATC tower and order your wingmen to destroy it. At this point, you will want to use your TSD to find the bombers taking off from the enemy airbase. The simulated Datalink capabilities mean that you won't need to activate your fighter's own radar to find them except as a last resort. The enemy bombers are identifiable by the name "HB-106" on the TSD and identifiable visually by their wide wings and whale-tail rudder setup. If you find any in the air, you can deploy an [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120]] missile against them to shoot them down. Don't worry about them potentially evading the missile; the bombers are fast, but somewhat slow to maneuver, making them easy prey for an active AIM-120 heading their way. After your missile goes pitbull, fly towards the left side of the airport and vector your thruster to 90 degrees. You will find a number of aircraft cued up to take off in this area, and a lot of those will be bomber jets. With your F-45A in vertical-flight mode, you can easily point your fighter at a ~45 degree angle and deploy your minigun against the fighters trying to take off in a clean strafing run. A properly lined-up strafing run can easily destroy an entire line of fighters/jets in cue. You should also be aware of a [[SAAW]] tank near the airbase's helipads that can engage targets at close range; you may need to destroy this one as well, or order your wingmen to do it for you. If there are any bombers left behind after your strafing run, vector your thrust back down to 0 degrees and bring down any jets remaining before they can get too far away.

Like with the artillery trucks, command will notify you that the bombers have been neutralized. Your next targets are located directly north, just outside of the nearby metropolitan area: the two C2 bunkers. This part of the mission is deceptively simple; you will have received another group of GPS targets on group MSN 2, these being the exact locations of the enemy's command and control bunkers. As such, bringing along at least two [[GBU-38 Bomb]]s will make this objective relatively easy. Fly above the bunkers, select your GBU-38s, and squeeze the trigger once the two diamonds are inside the inner circle (make sure the auto-targeting mode is enabled in the SMS configuration page). Your only notable threats here will be another SAAW and a MANPADS unit near the bunkers for close-range air defense. Once the bunkers have been destroyed, you should have only one objective remaining: the stealth fighters. They will be landed at a larger airbase to the north. Fly underneath a bridge there and follow the river straight to the airbase. Crest the hill where the river ends and you will immediately find another airbase, where a group of [[ASF-58]]s are preparing to take off from. You should be able to get to them before any of them can take off, in which case a few more strafing runs (like the ones performed against the bombers) can easily destroy at least the bulk of them. If any fighters take off, they will immediately attempt to attack you, in which case you can simply hit them with [[AIM-9+ Sidewinder|heat-seeking missiles]] before they get a bead on you. 

Once the fighters are gone, and every other objective has been completed as well, you will be cleared to return to the carrier. The rest of the fighters will likely have completed their SEAD objectives by this time, so the radars of the enemy fleet and the shoreline air defenses should be out of commission by this point. Fly over the bay towards the area where the artillery trucks were and crest the hills to rendezvous back up with the carrier fleet. Land back at the Assault Carrier to complete the mission.

=== "A hardened bunker manned with machine gunners." -- In-Game Description ===
[[File:Bunker Allied Enemy.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]The Bunker is a stationary ground defense emplacement in VTOL VR. It will fire at units coming near with rifles, similar to what [[Infantry]] use. The most notable aspect of the Bunker is how hard it is to destroy. Cannons are unable to harm bunkers, as well as most AGMs. Bunkers can be destroyed using bombs, or any of the following AGMs:
* [[AGM-65]]
* [[AGM-161]]

The CAGM-6 is a Cluster Air-to-Ground Missile available to the [[AV-42C]] and the [[F/A-26B]]. It releases 6 smaller missiles [sub-munitions] once close to the initial target point. These missiles act like smaller independently homing AGMs. Players can only aim the cluster missile, not the sub munitions. The sub munitions deploy 2.2 kilometers away from the target and will find targets inside of a 1 kilometer cone. Aiming and deployment of the CAGM is done similarly to the [[AGM-65]]. 

Like the [[CBU-97 Bomb|CBU-97]], players should allow adequate time for the weapon to disperse. It is possible for the cluster missile to disperse the sub-munitions immediately upon launching. However, the submunitions may not have enough time to find and navigate to their targets.

It is typically useful against groups of hostiles in close formation, such as convoys and smaller enemy bases.

It is initially deployed like a [[Mk. 82 Bomb]], though it is recommended to deploy it using the CCRP Auto function for better accuracy. The bomb has a minimum release altitude to give the submunitions time to deploy. It functions well as an alternative to the [[CAGM-6 Cluster Missile]], especially against larger groups of targets. The dispersion area cannot be adjusted.

When the bomb reaches its activation altitude, it deploys 10 sub-munition dispensers on parachutes each containing 4 explosively-shaped Skeet charge penetrators. When the sub-munition dispensers reach their activation heights, the Skeets swing out and shoot upwards. They then scan the area below them with built in infrared sensors, and if they find an IR emitter, they fire off armor-penetrating projectiles to destroy the targets.[[Category:Armament]]

'''Cannons''' are the main weapon that aircraft have available. They can be fired similarly to the [[Hydra 70|Hydra 70s.]] Each playable aircraft has at least one cannon available:
* [[AV-42C]]: GAU-8, [[M230 Chain Gun]]
* [[F/A-26B]]: M62 Vulcan
* [[F-45A]]: GAU-22 Redeemer
* [[AH-94]]: [[GAU-94]], [[M230 Chain Gun]]

== Gunsight ==
Every cannon has a visual gunsight which automatically activates within 1 kilometer. It corrects for the movement of the closest enemy aircraft in front of your aircraft and allows you to make accurate shots. To extend this range, the F/A-26B's M62 Vulcan has a radar gunsight which activates when a target is locked on radar, no matter the range.

The visual gunsight does not function against ground vehicles. When the gun pipper is over the ground, it is in CCIP (Constantly Computed Impact Point) mode, and does not correct for movement of ground units. However, locking a vehicle with the TGP will enable a corrected gunsight which accounts for movement.

[[File:26b carrierLanding.png|thumb|312x312px|Carriers make for excellent mobile platforms for deploying fighters from, so long as you know how to use them properly!]]This article offers a guide on how to properly take off from and land on naval carriers. It is designed with the [[F/A-26B]] in mind, but its principles can apply to other playable aircraft as well.
== Introduction ==
There are two different types of carriers available to the playable faction in VTOL VR:
* The [[Aircraft Carrier]] - a typical aircraft carrier.
* The [[Assault Carrier]] - a smaller carrier intended for use with VTOL/STOVL aircraft like the [[F-45A]] and the [[AV-42C]].

All playable aircraft in-game aside from the [[AH-94]] support carrier operations. The F/A-26B is the primary carrier-based aircraft due to its lack of VTOL functionality. VTOL VR models many aspects of carrier landings, such as wind and hook physics. As such, real-world patterns and techniques should generally be applied here. This page will go through those techniques in detail, and explain how they pertain to VTOL VR.

== Carrier Takeoff ==

=== Preface ===
The F/A-26B has a CATO TRIM switch on the flight assist panel that trims the rear stabilizers up by ~20°. Activation of CATO TRIM is not required but is highly recommended to simplify takeoffs and ensure safe rotation. The AV-42C and F-45A have automatic CATO TRIM when Flight Assist is ON.
=== Checklist ===
The Aircraft Carrier has 4 catapults, numbered 1–4. Catapults 1 and 2 are most commonly used, as they are not on the landing runway; this permits simultaneous takeoffs/landings. When requesting takeoff from ATC, the controller will assign you a "cat", or catapult. Taxi to your assigned catapult, then follow this checklist:
# Set Launch Bar DOWN.
# Line up the aircraft (forward-nosecone indicator on the HUD) with catapult and connect by rolling over the hub.
# When hooked in, set Wing Fold DOWN.
# Set Flaps 1.
# If applicable, set CATO TRIM ON (located in the Flight Assist Panel).
# Release stick, grip right handlebar.
# Throttle up to afterburner.
# After launch, retract your landing gear and launch bar, wait 3 seconds, set CATO TRIM OFF, set Flaps to 0, and regain control.

== Carrier Landing ==

=== Preface ===
Carrier landing is generally a very difficult task for many pilots. Unlike landing on an airport's runway, landing on a carrier is more about precision than anything else. It is generally a good idea to learn how to make minimal corrections to your flight path and start your maneuvers as early on as possible. Most importantly, practice is key. It takes time to develop a good technique for making smooth carrier landings. The checklist below serves as a baseline for stable carrier approaches.

=== Carrier Landing Checklist ===
# Fly past the starboard side of the carrier.
# At 800&nbsp;ft, Set your Tailhook DOWN.
# Lower your Landing Gear and slow your aircraft to 250KIAS (use your airbrakes if needed).
# Set Flaps to mode 2.
# Descend to 600&nbsp;ft.
# Contact Tower for landing clearance and Information
# Turn to Intercept the Glideslope.
# Slow to where your Angle of Attack (AoA) is at 8 degrees (adjust power accordingly).
# At ¾ miles, the LSO will call out "[CALLSIGN], Call the Ball."
# Follow the “Meatball” on the HUD to landing: If the Light is low, so are you. If the Light is high, so are you. Try to keep the Ball in the center. (BALL WILL INCREASE BRIGHTNESS WHEN CENTERED)
# In the final stages of the approach, follow LSO's guidance as closely as possible. Mind you do not overcorrect with your maneuvers here.
# Maintain an AoA of 8. Do NOT Flare. Fly the aircraft onto the runway and make contact with the arrestor cables.
# Upon Contact, Advance Throttle to Afterburner in case you miss the wires to avoid stalling.
# (If Wire Caught) Hold Afterburner for 4 seconds. Set Throttle IDLE. Set Hook UP, Set Wings UP, Set Flaps 0, Taxi to Parking Area
# (If Wire Missed) Bolter! Monitor Fuel Levels.
'''<nowiki/>'''

=== LSO Guidance ===
The LSO (Landing Signal Officer), upon you entering the "groove", or the final approach to the carrier, will call out "call the ball". Your response format is - “[CALLSIGN], Ball.” For example:
* LSO - “Kilo 1-1, call the ball.”
* Pilot - “Kilo 1-1, Wasp Ball”
After calling the ball, the LSO will give guidance down from ¾ miles. If Clara Ball has been called, it will begin immediately. Responding to the LSO is not strictly required for landing; if no response is given, then the LSO will start guiding you in at ¾ miles.

The LSO's commands are as follows:
* "Come left" - turn slightly left
* "Right for lineup" - turn slightly right
* "Power" - climb slightly, add some power to compensate for the resulting loss of airspeed
* "You’re high" - descend slightly, reduce power to compensate
* "Wave off!" - Pull up and break off. Re-enter the left-hand pattern.
* "Bolter!" - You've touched the deck but missed the wires - go around and try again!

[[File:FA26B CFT Comparison.jpg.jpg|thumb|294x294px|Top: The F/A-26B with its CFTs equipped. Bottom: The F/A-26B with its CFTs unequipped.]]
The Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFTs) are an addon available for the [[F/A-26B]], applied in the same way its external TGP would be. Like the TGP addon, the CFTs cannot be jettisoned. The CFTs allow the F/A-26B to hold an extra 6400 total liters of fuel for flight. This has the main benefit of being able to greatly increase its maximum flight range without taking up its extra fuel tank ports. This gives the pilot an advantage in armament for super long-range or otherwise long-term missions. On the other hand, this brings about a very heavy penalty to your Thrust to Weight Ratio with greater amounts of fuel being loaded in. This can make maneuvering in short order a great challenge, and may necessitate a fighter escort in missions where hostile fighters and/or interceptors are a threat. Even so, the CFTs can make for a fair addon in roles where maneuvering isn't much of a problem.

''Counter Bomber'' is a [[Quick Flight Missions|Quick Flight Mission]] available for the [[F-45A]]. It involves the player assisting in creating a diversion to destroy [[HB-106 Bomber|hostile bombers]] in enemy territory.

OBJECTIVES:
* Assault the coastal airbase
** Destroy the [[MAD-4 Radar|long-range SAM radars]]
** Shoot down the enemy fighters
* Rearm at the FARP
* Assault the valley airbase
** Destroy the two bombers before they can escape
* Return to the carrier

== Recommended Loadout ==
=== Phase I ===
* E2: [[AGM-161]]
* E3: [[AGM-145 Ballista|AGM-145]]
* E1, E4: [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9+]]

=== Phase II ===
* E2, E3: [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120D]]
* E1, E4: AIM-9+
* Optional:
** E5-E7, E8-E10: AIM-120D

== Walkthrough ==
=== Phase I ===
The mission starts off with the player's F-45A on their [[Aircraft Carrier|aircraft carrier's]] deck. They are assigned to take off first and dispatch the long-range air defenses near the coastal airbase before the main assault begins. Shortly after taking off and gaining some altitude, the player's fighter will pick up on the radar signals of the long-range radars on their RWR. The F-45A's Tactical Situational Display (TSD) can be used to not only locate and identify the radar signals on the map, but also target them from afar. This can be used in conjunction with the nav map to plan out an attack path in advance or even to launch cruise missiles (the [[AGM-161]], in the F-45A's case) from a safe and reliable distance to a target. If you elect to utilize a cruise missile, target the radar to the north of the base, mark it on the GPS, climb to ~7500 feet Above Sea Level, and fire the cruise missile at the target. In this case, if you are high up enough, creating a GPS ''path'' towards the target will be largely unnecessary. From there, target the other radar--the one closer to the airbase--with your TSD and press the EOTS button to slew your F-45A's EOTS (targeting pod) to the target. Descend to ~40 feet ASL and fly over to the bridge near the city adjacent to the airbase. The cruise missile should impact its target by the time you reach the bridge. At this point, you should select your [[AGM-145 Ballista|AGM-145]], fly to the edge of the hill above the lake, and fire a missile towards the target. Bear in mind that AGM-145 missiles have Lock On After Launch (LOAL) functionality and can automatically maneuver over terrain to reach their targets, so you do not have to 'pop up' to attack the target. Once the second missile is out, vector south and fly down the river to reach a small lake.

If you've done everything correctly, both your cruise missile and your AGM should impact their targets with no interference. Command will then inform you that the assault is commencing and they are dispatching a CAP group, callsign India, to assist with taking down the fighters. Once you get the message, fly towards the airbase and commence the attack. There will be a few [[IRAPC]]s near the airbase, so you may need to use some more AGMs to destroy them before attacking. From here, you will find a group of fighters preparing to take off from the airbase. It is recommended to use your F-45A's cannon to destroy them before they can take off. Fly up to the airbase, vector your throttle to 90 degrees, and squeeze the trigger as your crosshair passes over the enemy fighter(s). You should be able to destroy 1-2 fighters per strafing run like this. Any fighters that do get the chance to take off will likely get shot down by the oncoming CAP support. If not, you can easily hit them at close range with heat-seeking missiles. Once all of the fighters are destroyed, the CAP group will be called off and you will be assigned to land at the FARP to prepare for the next phase of the mission. Fly over the mountains and land on the open landing pad at the new waypoint. Vertical landings can be tricky in the F-45A, but the earlier you can vector to 90 degrees and start slowing yourself down, the easier your approach and landing will be. Avoid using the F-45A's VCAP function here, as it is primarily designed for making vertical takeoffs and will only make things harder for you when landing. There will be another landing pad at the FARP that is occupied by another F-45A; it will join you to assist with the next phase of the attack. Once you land, turn your master arm switch off, turn off your engine, and use the comms panel to request a rearm. You should only arm your fighter with [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120]] and [[AIM-9+ Sidewinder|AIM-9+]] air-to-air missiles for this phase. It is left up to the player how this is accomplished, but make sure to keep your Thrust to Weight Ratio above 1.10 to allow for a smooth vertical takeoff.

=== Phase II ===

Once your loadout is ready, start your fighter back up, take off, and vector west to the enemy airbase. Your other F-45A will form up with you for the attack. Another fighter squadron, callsign Bravo, will have already taken off to eliminate the airbase's air defenses while you complete your mission. The airbase here has much stronger defenses than the coastal airbase, sporting a number of long-range air defenses and a large compliment of [[ASF-30]]s to boast. The fighters here can be problematic, but your main targets are still the bombers at the airbase. Lean on your wingman to hold off the fighters while you hit the bombers. It is largely recommended to stay away from the airbase as its air defenses are very strong. The first bomber will take off and immediately vector west. Fly low on an intercept course and use an AIM-120 to hit it from far away. The bombers are fast, but somewhat sluggish to maneuver, so they are generally vulnerable to radar-guided missiles. The second bomber will take off and attempt to vector north as an alternate route to the fleet; once again, fly low to intercept them and hit them with an AIM-120. Once the two bombers are destroyed, you will be cleared to return to the carrier. Be wary of any fighters that could be pursuing you, though, as they won't give up on shooting you down.

=== ''"A medium sized drone ship armed with SAMs and basic gun turrets." -- Mission Editor Description'' ===
The DMS Cruiser is a common ship in the enemy navy, designed for mid-range air defense. It has five [[SAM Launcher|SAM launchers]] on its bow for targeting hostile aircraft in the area, complementing its own Vertical Launch System well for better air superiority. It also has three double-barrelled CIWS turrets located near its bridge for defending against missiles, bombs, and other aircraft at close range.

There is also another variant of the DMS Cruiser available: the [[Drone Carrier]]. Instead of five SAM turrets on its bow, it has an extra CIWS turret and 10 rocket-catapults capable of deploying numerous [[Manta UCAV]]s into the air.

== Armament ==

=== Weapons ===
* 3x Double-Barrel CIWS turrets; one in front of the bridge, two at the stern.
* 5x SAM turrets; all located at the bow, equipped with BSM-66 SAMs.
* 1x Vertical Launch System; located at the stern, near the two CIWS turrets.

=== Radar ===
* 1x Dorsal rotating radar; identifiable as ''DM'' on the [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)]]. {{Enemy Military Navbox}}[[Category:Ships]]

Radar is one of several target detection, acquisition, and tracking methods in VTOL VR. It works by sending out pulses and registering the 'echos' they send back to the radar source upon bouncing off of another object. In the context of VTOL VR, most radars are primarily intended for acquiring air targets, including jets and missiles.

Two main factors play into radar detection of units in VTOL VR: the radar source's power and the detectable object's Radar Cross-Section (RCS). Every radar source in VTOL VR will have a certain distance at which transmitted radio waves have little to no chance of providing any meaningful returns for the search radar. An object's RCS determines how much of a radar's radio waves are reflected back to the radar source, and is mainly dependent on the relative surface area that the radar in question can see. An object is considered 'detected' by a radar source if two criteria are fulfilled:
# The object is hit by the propagating radio waves.
# Enough of the radio waves reflect off the object and back to the searching radar to be registered by the radar system's AI.
For example, a fighter jet flying with its dorsal or ventral aspect facing directly towards a radar will give off a significantly higher RCS than if only its front is facing the radar, making it more visible to the radar from longer ranges.

In general, an aircraft with more flat edges across its frame--such as the [[F/A-26B]]--will be much more visible to a radar than other aircraft due to its geometry causing more radio waves to reflect back to the radar source. Conversely, aircraft like the [[F-45A]] will reflect fewer radio waves back to a radar source due to its more curved design; as such, it will be harder for radars to detect and start tracking an F-45A from range than something like an F/A-26B.

=== ''"Unmanned ship with 10 Manta drone launchers." -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The Drone Carrier is an alternative variant of the standard [[DMS Cruiser]] capable of launching 10x [[Manta UCAV]]s on command. It cannot launch UCAVs individually. It is designed to escort larger ships into enemy territory and assault hazardous areas or create diversions for enemy fighters. In a defensive context, the Drone Carrier is an easy method for mounting a defense against enemy air threats when scrambling fighters from a carrier would take too long.

Its drones can be deployed via its "Launch Drones" [[Event Actions|event action]] in the [[Mission Editor]].

[[File:AWACS Above Akutan.png|thumb|260x260px]]

=== ''"Airborne early warning radar jet (AWACS). It can scan a large area and provide aircraft positions via data link to allies." -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The '''E-4 Overlord''' is an allied AI-controlled aircraft with an AWACS radar affixed to the top. It uses its mounted 360 degree rotating radar dish to sweep long ranges (250–400 miles) scanning for targets and allies. The E-4 can then transmit this data to allied units and direct attack missions, or assist in helping other units rendezvous with air refueling tankers. 

The E-4's 360 degree radar does not operate similarly to the [[Fire Control Radar|SAM S/A Radar]] dish. Instead, it scans in a sphere rather than a half dome meaning there are no altitude blind spots. In game, units detected by the E-4 Overlord are always visible to the player, and there is no datalink or radio range simulated. This also means that there is no way to ask the unit about units outside the area visible on the NAV page of the MFD.

The E-4 has no defensive or offensive capability by itself, and instead relies on its powerful radar to detect threats and direct units to attack them. Players should be vigilant to defend it as enemy AI will engage it.

{{Collapsible|AEW-50 Bulwark
|[[File:AWACS AEW50 Profile.jpg|thumb|260x260px|The AEW-50 Bulwark, wearing its specialized REDFOR livery]]
The '''AEW-50 Bulwark''' is the REDFOR analogue of the E-4 Overlord. It behaves and performs in the same way as its BLUFOR counterpart, but has a different livery to represent its different allegiance.
}}

== Commands ==
Interaction with it is facilitated through the game's radio communication feature. There is a section in the COMMS MFCD page for it. The available commands are as follows:

* Bogey Dope: Provides a BRAA (see section below) to the nearest enemy fighter squadron.
* Picture: Provides the BRAA for the three nearest enemy fighter squadrons.
* RTB: Provides a bearing and range to the nearest friendly airbase. While AWACS will say "BRAA", it will not give you altitude nor aspect, since they wouldn't make sense in this context.
These can also be used as [[Voice Commands]]; you will need to prefix them with "AWACS"* or "Overlord" and this will need to be enabled beforehand in the [[Mission Editor]]. The recognized voice commands are as follows:

* '''''Bogey Dope'''''
** "Bogey dope."
** "Request bogey dope."
** "Ready for tasking."
** "BRAA"
** "Who is next"
** "Give me a target."
** "Where are they"
* '''''Picture'''''
** "Picture."
** "Request picture."
* '''''RTB'''''
** "RTB."
** "Request RTB."

''*Pronounced like "Ayy wax".''

== Terminology ==
AWACS uses a specific terminology for its callouts, one that provides relevant information about an enemy's position in a fashion as concise as possible. Here is how a callout is formed:

''"[Callsign], Overlord. (Popup) (Group/Hostile) [BRAA/Bullseye]: [BRAA data], [Modifiers]."''
* Callsign - AWACS will address you by your callsign for all communications. This is a phonetic alphabet word along with two numbers and is shown to you in the briefing room. For example, Alpha 1-1 or Tango 4–2.
* Overlord - AWACS will always refer to itself as Overlord.
* Popup - If a hostile is spotted within the AWACS' scanning range, meaning that it did not simply fly in to the engagement zone, AWACS will say "popup" to indicate. Reasons for this include enemies hiding via terrain and then being unmasked, or if the radar simply loses a signature.
* Group/Hostile - If AWACS determines that multiple aircraft are flying in formation/a group, it will address them as "group". Otherwise, it will address them as "hostile".
* BRAA/Bullseye - If a bullseye is defined for the mission, AWACS will give you BRAA from the bullseye's perspective instead of your own in most cases. However, AWACS will always give you BRAA from your own perspective when you're requesting bogey dope.
* BRAA data - BRAA comes in the form of four terms: 
** The first, bearing, is your true bearing to the target. For example, a bearing of 260 means that you should turn to heading 260 to head directly toward the target.
** The second, range, is your range to the target in whatever units you have set in your preferences.
** The third, altitude, is the target's altitude ASL in thousands of feet.
** The fourth, aspect, is the target's heading compared to you. Hot means that the target is headed directly at you, cold means directly away, and tracking north/south/east/west means the target is heading in that direction.
* Modifiers - AWACS will append a callout with several modifiers based on specific triggers. It will use multiple terms in one callout where appropriate:
** Low - Target is below 10,000 feet / 3,000 meters ASL.
** High - Target is between 25,000 and 40,000 feet / 7,600 and 12,200 meters ASL.
** Very High - Target is above 40,000 feet / 12,200 meters ASL.
** Fast - Target's speed is at least Mach 1 (600 knots ground speed).
** Very Fast- Target's speed is at least Mach 2 (1200 knots ground speed).
** Leans on Overlord - Target is becoming dangerously close to AWACS and it fears that it may be engaged. If this criterion is met, AWACS will immediately give you a callout to the target without being prompted.
In addition to this, AWACS will use the following terms where appropriate:
* Grand Slam - AWACS will say this when all hostile aircraft for the mission have been shot down. However, it will ''not'' say this term if a hostile is simply evading radar contact and cannot be seen.
* Clean - AWACS will say this if the player requests a picture or a bogey dope but it cannot see any hostiles.
* Homeplate - AWACS will refer to the closest allied airbase as this.

== Trivia ==
* The E-4's radome has no collision box.
* The model is reused from the aerial tanker. Although the refueling boom was deleted, the base is still attached to the fuselage.{{Allied Military Navbox}}[[Category:Aircraft]]

[[File:20190306003404 1.jpg|thumb|220x220px|4200L variant.]]External Fuel Tanks are available for the [[F/A-26B]], [[F-45A]], and [[AH-94]]. They count towards the external fuel gauge and can be jettisoned. They cannot be refilled from aerial refueling, and are always consumed by the aircraft first.

They are most useful for long-range missions, especially when large-scale combat isn't an immediate priority (such as in mission 3 of the [[Operation: Desert Cobra]] campaign). Fly to the AO, jettison your tank(s), and commence your attack.

This article could use some restructuring, specifically within the Avionics section. Scrub it clean for false or outdated info and make it look pretty.
-->
The '''F-45A (Ghost)''' is a sleek aircraft available to the Allied faction designed with stealth engagement in mind. It is a multi-purpose stealth aircraft with internal weapon bays and an advanced sensor suite. It is the only playable aircraft in the game that has an integrated internal weapons bay, allowing it to store its munitions inside the aircraft until needed. This has two main implications for the F-45A: it decreases drag across the aircraft, allowing it to reach higher In-Air Speeds, while also decreasing its radar cross-section, letting it both move closer to a radar source before detection and escape radar locks more easily through conventional evasive maneuvers such as notching.

== Strategy ==
The F-45A is arguably the most specialized playable aircraft in the game, intended mainly for use in stealth-oriented roles. It was created in response to the growing threat of hostile surface-based air defenses, especially where stronger modern [[SAM S/A Radar|ground radars]] and [[MAD-4 Launcher|SAM launchers]] were concerned. It is designed with pop-up attacks in mind, striking nearby targets before dipping back into cover or even striking targets from behind it. Even though it is not capable of equipping any Anti-Radiation Missiles, the F-45A can be a deadly asset in SEAD ops due in part to its aptitude in the area of evading radar-guided missiles. In scenarios where stealth is not required, though, the F-45A has the capacity to fit six extra pylons on its wings, allowing it to function as a versatile assault aircraft as well when needed.

In stealth-oriented roles, maneuverability and mobility are going to be key assets to an aircraft for remaining undetected when needed. As such, the F-45A has full VTOL capability. It can vector its thruster to 90 degrees to hover in a single place for extended periods of time, take off and land from smaller areas like helipads, or even for making strafing runs against ground targets.

''Main article:'' [[/Hardpoints|F-45A Hardpoints]]

== Avionics ==

=== Vertical Control Autopilot (VCAP) ===
This autopilot mode eases the workload in the transition between vertical and horizontal flight. The idea is that the throttle controls forward and aft acceleration, with the middle setting being zero acceleration. Pitch controls change in altitude. The computer will decide what is needed to achieve that depending on where in the flight envelope the plane is. For example, at low speeds altitude is changed by varying engine thrust, while at high speeds the computer opts to vary nose attitude. Pulling back on the stick doesn't explicitly mean "pitch up". Forward acceleration is accomplished by tilting the plane like a helicopter at low speeds, or changing nozzle tilt and thrust at high speeds.

Note: VCAP will not activate unless the [[Aerodynamics|TWR]] is 1.04 or higher.

==== Takeoff ====
* Turn VCAP on and center the throttle. This ensures the plane will lift straight up.  Afterburner is not available when the nozzle is rotated downwards more than zero degrees.
* Pull the stick back to 'pitch up'. Notice that the engine will begin to spool up, and the plane will ascend.
* Push the throttle forward to begin accelerating forward. Notice that the aircraft will initially pitch nose-down like a helicopter. Then, with increasing horizontal speed, the nose will rise, and the computer will use nozzle tilt more.
* At around 80kts, VCAP stops feeling like a helicopter and begins to react more like a plane. While pulling the stick back to increase altitude still spools up the engine, the aircraft starts to pitch up. The middle throttle position also tends to hold this speed, but it's around the upper limit.
* At around 120kts, VCAP will rapidly start to rotate the nozzle forward to  zero degrees in order to accelerate faster, all of which tends to override the middle throttle setting. The lift fan door will start closing to decrease drag, because the burden of providing lift shifts over to the wing and away from the nozzle.
* When VCAP is finished to transitioning to wing-borne flight, afterburner and full roll authority is restored.

==== Vertical Landing ====
This auto pilot mode also helps the pilot perform vertical carrier landings. Patterns are similar to aircraft carrier recovery patterns, but the meatball and glide slope terminate in a hover stop next to the carrier. The plane then crosses over to hover above the landing spot. Finally, the plane descends.

In VTOL VR, the middle throttle position will hold 50kts forward, which allows the aircraft to fly stationary relative to a moving vessel. When descending, the autopilot will choose a safe vertical speed.

=== Internal Bays ===
[[File:F45A Underbelly.jpg|thumb|220x220px|An underbelly profile picture of the F-45A, showing its internal bays.]]
There are 4 internal bays on the F-45A: two at the sides for small missiles and two larger ones below for larger weapons. The actuation of the internal bay doors changes behavior depending on the weapon type selected.
* When IR missiles are selected, the side bay doors are always open if the TRIG UNCAGE setting is OFF. This is allows the IR missile rack to swing out of the bay so the seeker can see forward. This does not apply to [[AGM-145 Ballista|AGM-145s]] stored within the side bays.
* For bomb release, a double action fire control is used. Holding the trigger opens the bay doors, and the cycle weapon button acts as a release button.
* For other weapons where introducing a delay isn't a problem, pulling the trigger once automates the cycling of the bay doors and weapon release (AIM-120s, AGMs and other long range missiles).

== Modular Touchscreen ==
The F-45A has a unique screen setup--instead of using individual MFDs with physical buttons, the F-45A employs the use of one large, modular touchscreen for its avionics. 

=== Top Margin Controls ===
The top margin of the screen includes various miscellaneous controls for the aircraft that would not have fit elsewhere in the cockpit. The controls are as follows, from left to right:<br><br>
'''Preset Selector'''<br>
This panel allows pilots to set and select preset panel layouts. Panel layouts can be assigned to a preset by pressing and holding down the corresponding preset button for three seconds. An audio and visual notification will appear next to the preset selector once a preset is saved. From there, the panel presets will persist between games and can be used for switching between various complex presets on the fly.<br><br>
'''Flight Notification Display'''<br>
This area contains the UI elements corresponding with different flight alert systems, such as altitude and missile launch warnings.<br><br>
'''Swap Button'''<br>
This button swaps the left- and right-hand panel groups, divided down the middle of the screen itself.<br><br>
'''Radar Power Button/Countermeasure Readout'''<br>
The button at the bottom (RDR PWR) allows the F-45A's radar to be toggled on and off. Two data readouts for the F-45A's current stores of Chaff and Flares will be shown above.
'''Fuel/Autopilot Readouts'''<br>
The last two panels are used for displaying the aircraft's fuel readout and controlling the aircraft's autopilot system.

<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;"><!--This Div is here to prevent organizational conflict between this section and the Cockpit section below.-->
<div>
== Panel Pages/Programs ==
The area below the top info area is where the panels are set and displayed. The panel UI itself is divided into two halves for its purposes. The pages can be set in one of four states:
* Half Margin: The program takes up one horizontal half of the screen UI in this state.
* Quarter Margin: The program takes up a quarter of the srceen UI in this state.
* Quarter Margin, Partial: Similar to the quarter margin, except the designated page is vertically confined to two thirds of its vertical space. Sub-portals can be found below for quick switching between set program pages.
* Sub-portal Margin: The program page is minimized below a partial quarter margin page, located at either the left or right side of the lower 1/3 margin. Program pages will not display related data while rendered as sub-portals, except for '''RWR and EOTS.'''

Additionally, half margin programs will include tabs in the lower portion of the screen, allowing for quickly switching between designated displays within the margin.
<!--=== Glass Cockpit UI === I'm keeping this section for the moment to use as reference. --Inlovewithabsol
On the F-45A there's one giant touch screen that can be divided into a maximum of 4 displays or a minimum of 2 displays. The arrows on the dividers of these collapse and expand them. Most pages are ported over from the MFDs of the other planes with modifications to work with touch screens. There are some pages unique to the F-45A.

Each window can be assigned a unique MFD page, which can be swapped out with the minimized pages by clicking on the corresponding tab. Tabs start off as BLANK by default and bring up the menu matrix when opened. Pressing a tab will swap the places of the open and minimized window. For example, NAV will become minimized to replace BLANK in the tab, and BLANK will be pulled up to show the menu.

Alternatively, tabs have an mini window form, allowing the display of widgets (currently only the TGP/EOTS and RWR). Otherwise, that window only shows the title of the page.

The SWAP button swaps left and right windows, and as a pair if there are multiple. This allows one to manage all windows with the left arm without needing to cross over the arm still holding the flight stick.

To prevent duplicates, the page opened in another window will be closed while bringing it over to the new window.-->
=== Tactical Situation Display (TSD) ===
[[File:F45A TSD display.png|thumb|F-45A Tactical Situation Display (TSD)]]
This page integrates data normally fragmented across several pages to create a 360 degree top down tactical awareness display. Units are populated here when detected (by your aircraft's sensors or through data link) in a similar fashion to the RADAR, ARAD, and NAV pages. Even after a unit isn't being detected by anyone on your team, the TSD will generate a predictive track for it for 35 seconds, based on the last known velocity of the aircraft, which will afterwards flash 5 seconds before disappearing. The addition of the cursor allows units to be designated for use in other systems while maintaining situational awareness. This mitigates the need to switch between Air-to-Air or Air-to-Surface workflows.

'''Designating a Target'''

Using the TSD cursor is similar to using the cursor on the RADAR page in the [[F/A-26B]]:
* Set the TSD as SOI and slew the cursor onto a target with the left thumb stick. The cursor will snap to a unit.
* On the HUD, a green dotted circle will appear, showing where the target is located in the world.
* Pressing the EOTS button will snap the EOTS to that target if the target is not a predicted track.
*Pressing the GPS-S button will set the designated target as a GPS target. You may now use GPS guided munitions against the designated target.
* The target is automatically used in other pages and systems.

When a target is hovered, a display appears in the lower-right-hand corner of the UI, displaying various telemetry statistics for the target. The values are as follows:
* '''B''' - Bearing (Relative to self)
* '''R''' - Range (Relative to self)
* '''A''' - Altitude (Relative to sea level)
* Unit's name
* '''M''' - Target Speed (Mach)
* '''H''' - Target's heading (Degrees)

==== Datalink ====
The F-45A's TSD can receive target telemetry from many different sources, including ''the F-45A's own radar, datalink, visual tracking, and the EOTS.'' The F-45A's sophisticated datalink technology allows its missiles to be fired at targets without a direct lock; as long the target is spotted by at least one friendly unit, or has a predictive track, a missile can receive indirect target guidance independently of the deploying aircraft.

The TSD will automatically manage the radar page as part of the fire control chain when firing AIM-120Ds. Once fired, the missile can receive target telemetry from many different sources, including ''the F-45A's radar, datalink, visual tracking, or the EOTS.'' This allows the F-45A to commence evasive maneuvers immediately after firing a missile. Once the fired missile goes pitbull, it will no longer require any further guidance to intercept its target. Note that predictive tracks will get more inaccurate the longer that they're active, which may lead to you shooting a missile away from any enemies.

==== Unit Symbology ====
Enemy ground or sea units appear as an orange square. Air units appear as a triangle with a line pointing forward. Any units emitting radar signals will be marked with two perpendicular lines jutting out from the front. Friendly ground or sea units appear as an upside down "U". 

==== Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) ====
A similar system to the AV-42C's TGP. EOTS has 3 viewing modes, day, night, and color. Day mode functions as a white-hot mode, where hotter objects appear whiter. Night mode is the same as the FA-26B's night mode, except it filters out heat from the sky and the ground, making it easier to see targets at longer distances. The EOTS has GPS send and acquire capabilities, while also being able to be slewed from the TSD, even when the EOTS page isn't opened.

==== Stores Management System (SMS) ====
[[File:F45A SMS page.png|thumb|F-45A SMS page]]
This page is similar to the F/A-26B and the AV-42C EQUIP page, where weapon configurations, arming status, and jettison status can be altered. However, there are 3 main differences:

* The Countermeasures (CMS) page is now integrated into the SMS page, as opposed to having its own page.
* The FUEL CONFIG page is now moved from the OPTION page to the SMS page. The fuel dump option is located here as opposed to a physical cover and switch. 
* The BAY DOOR OVERRIDES page is included in this page for manual override of the internal bay doors.

Instead of a jettison button panel seen in the F/A-26B and the AV-42C, this aircraft is equipped with a jettison combination selector switch/push button. To use the selector switch/push button, press and hold the trigger to grab the selector switch, twist your controller to move the switch to the desired setting, and press the countermeasures/weapon switch button to engage the setting. There are three options:
[[File:F45A jettison selector switch and button.png|thumb|F-45A jettison selector switch/push button]]

* '''SEL:''' Jettisons the stores selected in the SMS page, indicated by the orange border. 
* '''EXT:''' Jettisons all external stores.
* '''ALL:''' Jettisons all stores.</div><div>

The '''F/A-26B''' "Wasp" is a playable twin engine multi-role fighter aircraft, being the second aircraft to be added into VTOL VR. It is known for its sheer armament capacity, giving it the ability to equip a myriad of different weapons while still maintaining an acceptable Thrust to Weight Ratio. It is designed for Air-to-Air combat, but it is equally capable of Air-to-Ground combat as well. It serves as one of the most common fighters in the allied fleet, being nearly essential for large-scale air-based offensives.

== Strategy==
In comparison to the other playable aircraft, the F/A-26B has a superior thrust power and weapon capacity, allowing it to bring much more weaponry into battle than its siblings. Its radar inclusion enables it to function as an Air-Superiority Fighter in battle, fighting off hostile interceptor aircraft to ensure that its allies can safely serve their own purposes in battle. It is capable of deploying the powerful mid-long-range [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] for Beyond Visual Range (BVR) engagements along with other short-range Anti-Air missiles, such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], making it a formidable threat to other aircraft from any range. 

Additionally, it is capable of equipping many powerful Air-to-Ground weapons, such as the [[AGM-65]] and [[Mk. 82 Bomb]], allowing it to occupy ground forces as well if needed. Unlike other aircraft, though, the F/A-26B does ''not'' have an integrated [[Targeting Pod (TGP)]] and it must have one equipped in the Armament screen before it can use Air-to-Ground Missiles. In the context of Close Air Support (CAS), the F/A-26B is apt for hit-and-run attacks, dropping a payload onto ground forces before flying out of their range again. Its Air-to-Ground Missile (AGM) capacity also gives it the ability to undertake the potentially-dangerous role of Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). Among its repertoire of Air-to-Ground Missiles is the fearsome [[AGM-88]] Anti-Radiation Missile, which can be deployed against hostile Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) Radars from a reasonable distance to cripple hostile surface-based air defenses.

==Armament==
The F/A-26B has a rotary cannon, as well as hardpoints on the belly of the aircraft to mount different kinds of armaments. See article below for more information on hardpoints:

<!--[[File:FA26B Underbelly2.jpg|thumb|220x220px|A picture showing the F/A-26B's underbelly pylons, equipped with their default loadout.]]-->

===Radar Systems ===
To use the F/A-26B's radar system, pull up the RADAR page on the MFD and twist the Radar Toggle Knob clockwise. On the RADAR page, a line will be shown sweeping from left to right on a cone. Allied aircraft will show up as blue circles with lines jutting out at the front, enemy units will be shown as orange triangles with lines jutting out at the front, and missiles (Allied and Enemy) will be shown as red circles with lines sticking out from four ends. While the RADAR MFD is set as SOI (using the button in the upper-right corner), slewing the cursor over a contact and selecting it tracks the target using the F/A-26B's Track-While-Scan (TWS) system. This technique allows multiple targets within the radar's field of view to be tracked at once without having to rely on the main radar itself to sweep them. Up to 3 targets (excluding missiles) can be tracked at once via TWS. The downside to this is that the more targets that are being tracked by TWS, the slower the main radar will sweep, making finding new targets slower. To lock onto a target, select a contact again by pressing their corresponding button number on the left side of the MFD, or select them again using the slew cursor. A solid green line will connect to the target and two brief blips will play, signifying the establishment of a hard lock on the target. Targets with Radar Warning Receiver systems will be alerted to the hard lock. This system is required for the deployment of AIM-120 missiles. Pressing the '''+''' and '''-''' buttons on the radar will alter the displayed view range of the radar display. This can help differentiate between clustered targets at close range and show pinged contacts at longer ranges.

The '''ANGLE''' button on the RADAR MFD alters the sweep angle limit of the F/A-26B's radar. The radar starts at a sweep angle limit of ''60 degrees;'' pressing the ANGLE button toggles the sweep angle limit between ''30 degrees, 15 degrees,'' and then back to 60. A tighter sweep angle limit will result in a lower field of view for the radar, but this allows it to sweep much faster, mitigating any potential misfires from contacts suddenly 'disappearing' from the radar's field of view.

The '''MODE''' button switches the radar from horizontal sweep mode (default) to ''Forward Boresight'' mode. In this mode, the radar points straight forward and locks (hard lock) onto the first contact it spots. The radar in Boresight mode will only lock onto targets up to ~15 kilometers away. The '''HEAD''' button below MODE switches the radar to ''Head-tracking Boresight'' mode; instead of pointing straight forward, the Boresight radar follows the player's head movements, locking onto whatever it finds first.

=== ''"Stationary fire control radar for air defense missiles." -- [[Mission Editor]] Description'' ===
[[File:FCR_with_SAM-P.jpg|thumb|A Fire Ctrl Radar P alongside the Allied Faction's SAM Launcher P.]]
The '''Fire Ctrl Radar P''' is a stationary static fire control radar for the Allied Faction's surface-to-air missiles. Unlike the other SAM radars the Allied Faction has access to, the Fire Ctrl Radar P is a static radar which holds a single angle at all times. This restricts the radar's area coverage, but allows for faster radar sweep periods in its focused field of view.

The '''GAU-94''' is a triple-barrelled Gatling style rotary cannon, chambered for the 20mm round and available only to the [[AH-94]]. It operates similarly to the [[M230 Chain Gun]], as it is mounted on a gimbal. It was designed with close air support in mind and can target ground units using the TADS (Target Acquisition and Designation Sight).

* Using the TEDAC (TADS Electronic Display and Control), you may also slew the TADS cursor to a target, and the gun will target the enemy, allowing you to fire upon it with precision.
* If the head-track mode is enabled, the GAU-94 will track the TADS' crosshair, and this feature can be utilized for swift engagement of several ground targets.

When going above 110m/s, the gun will be speed locked and will operate similarly to static cannons, such as the [[Cannons|GAU-8 Avenger]].

=== ''"A STOVL/VTOL ground attack jet" - in game description'' ===
The GAV-25 Bullshark is the main VTOL aircraft for the enemy faction in the game. This unit specializes in Air-to-Ground combat; its sheer potential firepower makes it a formidable asset in Close Air Support tactics. It has no radar, falls short in terms of speed, and is only capable of equipping heat-seeking missiles, making it somewhat vulnerable to hostile interceptor aircraft.

== Armament ==
These are the weapons the GAV-25 can equip, as listed in the [[Mission Editor]].
* 1x Internal slot
** CG-25 Twin Chaingun - "A fixed 25mm dual-barreled chaingun."
* 8x External pylons
** GMA-6 x2 - "A medium range optically guided 'fire-and-forget' anti-tank missile."
** GMA-14 x3 - "A rack of 3 laser-guided anti-tank missiles."
** WR-25 Rocket Pod - "A hexagonal pod carrying 25 unguided rockets."
** ASF-SRM x1 - "A standard heat-seeking anti-air missile."
** ASF-SRM x2 - "A rack of two standard heat-seeking anti-air missiles."
** ASF-SRM x3 - "A rack of three standard heat-seeking anti-air missiles."
** SB-1 Bomb x3 - "Standard unguided 500lb bombs."
** ASF-SRM-RA x1 - "An older rear-aspect heat-seeking anti-air missile."
** ASF-SRM-RA x2 - "A rack of two older rear-aspect heat-seeking anti-air missiles."
** ASF-SRM-RA x3 - "A rack of three older rear-aspect heat-seeking anti-air missiles."

== Trivia ==
* Though the GAV-25 cannot be loaded with passengers in the Mission Editor like with the AV-42C, one of these fighters did play a transportation role in mission 7 (''Striking Oil'') of the F/A-26B's campaign. In the second phase of the mission, if the player takes too long to destroy the VIP's convoy, then it will stop at a checkpoint and the VIP (and presumably their guards) will board a GAV-25, which will attempt to extract them from the map.

=== "A 500lb laser-guided bomb." -- In-Game Description ===
The GBU-12 is a laser-guided bomb available for the [[F/A-26B]] and the [[F-45A]]. It requires constant laser lock for accurate deployment, similarly to the [[AGM-114]], and uses the HUD symbology of GPS-guided bombs (see the [[GBU-38 Bomb|GBU-38]]'s article for more information) for deployment. Its deployment method is paralleled in the [[GBU-53 Advanced SD Bomb]], a Small-Diameter, optically-guided bomb available to the F-45A.

== Equip Options ==
* Like with all guided bombs, the GBU-12's guidance package can be disabled through this page, allowing it to function akin to an unguided bomb, like the [[Mk. 82 Bomb|Mk. 82]].

== Deployment Strategy ==
The GBU-12 is chiefly designed as an asset in Close Air Support tactics. In comparison to your average Air-to-Ground Missile, the GBU-12 can be deployed more easily on short notice and carry a much larger payload, allowing it to easily dispatch hostile units in close formation. It can cripple ground vehicles in a wide radius and infantry units in a radius even wider.

The guidance package relies on a constant TGP laser lock for accurate deployment against ground targets, similarly to the [[AGM-114]]. If the TGP's laser deviates from its target, the GBU-12 could maneuver far off-course and not damage its intended target at all. As such, when deploying from the F/A-26B, it is recommended to establish a left-hand orbit around the target after dropping the bomb for optimal target lock. The F-45A is not quite as encumbered by such a restriction, as its ventral-mounted EOTS (TGP equivalent) gives it much more room to maneuver while maintaining laser lock. In either case, scenarios where air defenses are present can pose significant problems for deploying aircraft. Having to maneuver out of harm's way is very likely to result in breaking laser lock on a ground target, resulting in deployed bombs being summarily wasted after deployment. Ideally, GBU-12s should be deployed within environments with minimal air defenses, generally after SEAD and CAP groups have had a chance to clear the area of major threats to deploying aircraft.[[Category:Armament]]

=== ''"500lb GPS guided direct attack munition. It's a Mk.82 bomb with a guidance package strapped on." -- In-Game Description'' ===
The GBU-38 is a basic 500lb GPS-guided bomb. Its tactical employment is roughly similar to the [[Mk. 82 Bomb]], but the inclusion of a GPS guidance package makes it much more accurate than its generic counterpart. It functions very well as an asset in precise, coordinated attacks due to its accuracy and destructive capability. 

== Equip Options ==
The GBU-38 has a small set of config options to determine how the weapon functions in battle:
* '''Target''' '''Mode''' - This determines the deployment method of the GBU-38. It can be switched between two modes: ''Auto, Manual, ''and ''Dumb.'' ''Auto'' configuration causes it to cycle to the next target in the GPS list automatically once a bomb is dropped; otherwise (in ''Manual'' mode), this would have to be done manually. When set to ''Dumb,'' the GBU-38's guidance package is disabled and it can thereby be deployed in the same way the Mk. 82 is. 
* '''Auto''' '''Rel[ease] Rate''' - This option determines how many bombs are dropped per second while the trigger is held. Its default option is ''Single.''

== Usage ==
In its default mode, it requires GPS coordinates for deployment. This allows it to hit targets with precision accuracy, making it exceptionally useful as a bunker-buster weapon, but that makes it useless against moving ground targets. Alternatively, the GPS guidance package can be disabled entirely in a fighter's EQUIP MFD page in a pinch, allowing it to function the same way as a regular Mk. 82 would.

The GBU-39 is a GPS-guided Small-Diameter bomb available for all playable aircraft to utilize. A single rack can hold 4 bombs at once, making it a viable cost-friendly option for restricted missions. Unlike its relative, the [[GBU-38 Bomb|GBU-38]], the GBU-39 has less radius and damage, but is still a viable bunker-buster and can deploy its own glide-wings to hit targets from farther away. This maneuverability addon allows it to function more accurately when lobbed over cover. The GBU-39 requires set GPS coordinates for deployment; this makes its bombs extremely accurate against ground targets, but makes it somewhat useless against moving units.

== GBU-39ER ==

The GBU-39ER is a variant of the GBU-39 exclusively available to the [[AH-94]]. Unlike regular GBU-39s, the GBU-39ER has a brief booster stage for launched missiles, allowing them to gain velocity on deployment to account for the AH-94's lack of flight speed. It is the only weapon on the AH-94 capable of destroying bunkers.

===''"An internally-mounted rack of 4 optically-guided Small Diameter bombs. Each bomb has folding wings that allow it to glide for long distances and hit targets with precision. Advanced optics allow it to track moving targets from extended range without laser designation." -- In-Game Description''===

The GBU-53 is a type of guided Small Diameter bomb available exclusively to the [[F-45A]]. It is an advanced alternative to the conventional [[GBU-39]] SD bombs with further versatility. The most notable advantage it has over the GBU-39 is that it is not GPS-guided; instead, it is deployed using the F-45A's EOTS (TGP), much like the [[GBU-12]]. The most important note about the GBU-53 is that it contains a built-in optical targeting system like the [[AGM-145 Ballista]], giving it full fire-and-forget capabilities against moving targets. Consistent lock is not required for any targeting. 

Like other GBUs, its guidance package can be disabled entirely through the F-45A's SMS page to allow it to function like an unguided bomb.

=== ''"A small unmanned boat carrying a basic gun turret" -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The Gun Boat is one of the more basic ships in the fleet. It is a small boat with a single Double-Barreled CIWS at the front. It can be a good addition for fleet support, and works well in small fleets. Unlike its bigger cousins, the Gun Boat and its other variants can be easily destroyed by a simple burst fire from a fighter's main gun, making it somewhat nonviable for frontal assaults.

The base of the Gun Boat also facilitates the inclusion of two unit variants:
* [[Rocket Boat]]: Same as the Gun Boat, except it has a mid-range heavy rocket launcher for naval superiority.
* [[Mine Boat]]: Essentially a Gun Boat without a CIWS turret. It has a set of decorate sea mines in the back. So far it only serves as a decoration/easy target.

== Armament ==
* 1x Double-Barreled CIWS Turret; located at the boat's bow.{{Enemy Military Navbox}}[[Category:Ships]]

This feature can be turned on by flipping the HMCS switch on their aircraft up and either pressing a button on their helmet or pressing their fighter's "VSR" button. Activating this feature brings down the visor on the player's helmet. It has several main benefits: 
* It allows the player to see the entirety of their aircraft's HUD beyond the HUD's display screen, being useful for altitude control or identifying the locations of hostile units with the [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)]].* 
* It allows the player to use their night vision overlay.* 

* If the player's aircraft has an active TGP...
** It allows players to "See through" their aircraft in conjunction with their [[Targeting Pod (TGP)]].
** It can let them control the position of the targeting reticle with their head, being useful for the deployment of AGMs and quick targeting in close combat.
**When the TGP/TADS is SOI on the MFCD, pressing and holding the stick thumb down for 2 sec will transfer it to the HMD, where you can then zoom in/out pushing the stick forward/back.
**When the TGP/TADS is on the HMD clicking on the stickthumb will lock the current target and transfert it back to the MFCD.

''*This function runs independently of the visor in the [[F-45A]].''

When not looking at the HUD, or if the main HUD is turned off, the visor renders a display showing pilots their heading, speed, and altitude.

The Hydra 70 is a rocket pod available for the [[AV-42C]], [[F/A-26B]], and [[AH-94]]. Each pod contains a number of unguided rockets which are utilized similarly to an ordinary cannon. It is generally very easy to load and use on a fighter. Its rockets can reach impressive speeds in the air very quickly and pack impressive explosive power into each one, making them valuable for Close Air Support tactics. Even just a rocket or two to a naval ship's bridge can bring it down with ease.

The EQUIP menu has options for single shot or rapid fire (ripple) modes, as well as salvo sizes.

The most basic units in the game, available for both the allied and enemy factions. They will engage targets with their assault rifles. Their assault rifles largely pale in comparison to weapons such as the [[Z20x2 Anti-Air Artillery]] turrets, but still have the potential to deal a fair amount of damage to passing low-flying aircraft, especially if multiple infantrymen are in a tight formation.

They will engage any enemy units up to ~0.5km (0.2nm).

The '''Localization Editor''' is a game feature that allows users to translate the game into another language and contribute to the ongoing VTOL VR game translation efforts. It requires no texturing or file editing skills, as the game provides the editor, or you can use a spreadsheet application, the files for Localizations are stored as Comma-Separated Values files (.csv).

== Accessing the Files/Accessing the In-Game Editor ==
[[File:Game menu 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|306x306px|Main Menu Page with Localization Button Among Others]]
It is possible to access the localization editor without SteamVR detecting an HMD the same way the [[Map Editor|Map]] and [[Mission Editor]]s would be through the desktop. The button to access the editor will be located on the bottom left of the Main Menu, similar to how the Map Editor can be accessed. Alternatively, the files themselves can be found in the following area within Steam's local files:
 steamapps\common\VTOL VR\Localization\[LOCALIZATION NAME]

== Localization Menu ==
[[File:Localization Main Menu.jpg|thumb|306x306px|Localization Main Menu]]
Upon opening the localization menu, you will be met with a few options. You will find the option to return to the Main Menu in the top right ("Return to Game" button).

=== New Language Menu ===
Clicking the "New Language" button opens a new menu. Here, one of the preset languages can be selected in order to create a folder and start to localize, or create a custom one. Clicking the language you wish to localize will create a new directory and the files necessary inside; an external spreadsheet editor may be utilized for this if desired. This button will also open the Localization Menu. To create a custom language, enter a name in the box that states: "Enter custom language code..." and click the "Custom Language" button. Mind that the title only supports alphabetical characters; only a-z are allowed and no spaces may be included.

=== Choosing a Language to Edit ===
Upon clicking on a language in the Localization Menu, all of the .csv files inside the folder will be shown. To start editing one, click on it. [[File:Editing file.jpg|thumb|306x306px|Localization Editor]]
===Editing a File===
Clicking on a file to edit opens a new page, which shows you every entry to edit on the left (in English) and on the right (in the desired language). 

Each entry (represented each by a separated gray box) includes the entry's file name, the entry's corresponding text string below, a box where the translation of said entry will go and finally, a category on the top center of every box. Certain categories are important to pay attention to, as certain entries in those categories need to keep the same amount of characters and/or format (such as entries that will appear on GUI, the MFDs, the MMFDs, etc.), make an educated guess as to which require that special attention and/or test to make sure they fit in their allocated space. 

Additionally, there are arrow buttons at the bottom center of the screen that are used to navigate through each page (showing 20 entries per page). Finally, there is a search box on the top left of the menu, allowing you to search for specific entries to edit. Always save regularly to prevent loss of progress. 

== .CSV File Format ==
[[File:Loc as csv.png|thumb|306x306px|A French Localization CSV File Open in Google Sheets|alt=]]This section is a quick run-down of what column does what in the CSV files in case you wish to edit directly with a spreadsheet editor.A language file must first be created through the Editor before it can be seen here.

* The first column, named "Key", is the internal name for all of the entries;
* The second, named "Description", is a quick description of the entries;
* The third, named "en", is the entry you will need to translate in English; and
* The fourth, named "XX", where XX = the first 2 letters of your localization, will be the translated entry.

== Publishing the Localization ==
In order to publish your localization, you will need to join the official [https://discord.gg/u7X72wc VTOL VR Discord server], go to the #vtol_localization channel, drop a compressed file with your localization, and let the developer know you have completed the localization.

[[File:20190306003554 1.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]The '''M230 Chain Gun''' is a weapon available to the [[AV-42C]] and [[AH-94]] as an alternative to the [[Cannons|GAU-8]] and [[GAU-94]] cannons. It is designed with Close Air Support tactics in mind, being capable of rotating around a turret gimbal to track and targeting ground units with the assistance of the aircraft's onboard [[Targeting Pod (TGP)]] (or [[Targeting Pod (TGP)|TADS]] in the AH-94. It stands for Target Acquisition and Designation Sights). When traveling at less than {{Tooltip|110m/s|~400 KPH}}, the turret will be slaved to the TGP crosshair, allowing for easy acquisition and engagement of targets on the ground. In this mode, there are two main methods pilots can use for weapon deployment:
* Slew the TGP cursor onto a ground target to track them with the M230. This will allow for precision accuracy against individual targets, and lead correction against moving targets.
* If the TGP's head-track feature is enabled (the HMCS switch must be on and your helmet's visor must be down), then the M230 will track the TGP's crosshair as it moves around and it can be used for quick deployment against multiple ground targets. 
In addition to the prior features, in the AH-94 if the person with weapon control does not have SOI set to '''TADS''', the cannon will automatically point to where the person is looking at.

Otherwise, if flying beyond its gimbal-slaving speed limit, the turret will be locked forwards and will function similarly to the GAU-8.

* Cost: $1,000
* Weight: 937&nbsp;kg
* Ammo: 1200 rounds

===''"The missile launcher component of the Mobile Air Defense system. It must be connected to a dedicated radar unit to find and track targets (not necessarily the MAD-4 radar). It can only move while Engage Enemies is unchecked (its launch tubes will fold)." -- Mission Editor description''===
The MAD-4 Launcher is a component of the enemy faction's Mobile Air Defense system. It contains a set of super long-range Anti-Air missiles similar to those launched by the [[NMSS Cruiser]]'s forward launch tubes. These missiles have a longer burn time than regular Surface-to-Air Missiles, making them much harder to evade on short notice. They have an overall effective range of about 55&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;nm). When Engage Enemies is unchecked, it can move around as a regular ground vehicle, offering it a degree of mobility in the field for redeployment if desired. The MAD-4 Launcher can be paired with any [[Fire Control Radar]], but it tends to work best when paired with an [[MAD-4 Radar]] to better compliment the sheer range of its missiles.

== Armament ==
* MAD-4 Missile - "Standard semi-active radar-guided missile built for the Mobile Air Defense launcher. It has a range of about 55km (30nm)."
* MAD-4A Missile - "Advanced active radar-guided missile built for the Mobile Air Defense launcher. It has a range of about 55km (30nm)."

===''"The radar component of the Mobile Air Defense system. It can only move while Engage Enemies is unchecked (radar components will fold). The MAD-4 system features super long-range radar and missile technology on a mobile platform." -- Mission Editor description''===
This ground vehicle is one half of the MAD-4 mobile radar defense system. Its radar activates when its Engage Enemies property is enabled in the mission editor and it functions similarly to the [[Fire Control Radar|SAM S/A Radar.]] It cannot move and have its radar active at the same time.

The MAD-4 radar is notorious for being a very powerful radar system, capable of detecting, tracking, and locking onto targets from super long-range, similarly to the [[NMSS Cruiser]]'s long-range radar. It is recommended to pair this with an [[MAD-4 Launcher]] to better compliment its sheer range and mobility. This radar also works exceptionally well with the [[SAM Launcher]]'s BSM-66LR and FLKM-100 missile configurations, allowing them to better capitalize on their sheer range for more efficient target destruction.

The MAD-4 Radar can be identified as ''4'' on the [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)|RWR]].

[[File:FA26B home page.png|thumb|F/A-26B HOME page]]
'''MFD''' stands for Multi-Function Display. Buttons are located on the bezel surrounding the screen and their functions are labelled and changed depending on the currently chosen display. These may toggle between two states, or cycle sequentially through several states.

The MFD is turned on using the knob on either the bottom left or bottom right corner. The brightness of all MFDs can be adjusted by another knob in the cockpit. The MFD turns on to the HOME menu containing options to enter the following pages. Pressing HOME on any page returns to this first page.
[[File:F45A home page.png|thumb|F-45A MENU page]]

== RADAR ==
[[File:F45A RADAR page.png|thumb|F-45A radar page. Radar on the F-45A can also be controlled from the Tactical Situation Display ([[F-45A|TSD]]).|alt=]]
This page controls the onboard nose radar in the [[F/A-26B]].  The [[AV-42C Kestrel|AV-42C]] does not have radar, so it does not have a RADAR MFD page. The [[F-45A]] has a radar page, but it's largely unnecessary for pilots to access due to most radar functions being available through its own TSD MFD page (more info on that later). 

=== Sweep Mode ===
This page initially opens to a screen representing the scan area not to scale and relative angle only. There are numbered division rings indicating the range in the user's chosen units. Similar to the RWR, The scan area rotates relative to the movement of aircraft. However, the units are added to the screen once detected, but they are not updated until the next sweep. This means that although turning the aircraft moves the positions on the RADAR, those were the last seen positions of the targets relative to the aircraft. Compare this behavior with the latency free live view of units on the NAV map. For more frequent radar updates, users should opt for a smaller scan angle. 

Setting the Radar as SOI will allow the user to move the cursor using the controller's directional input. The cursor can snap to targets like the TGP. The user can do one of the following. 

==== Tracking Modes ====
* Center press once to save the target to memory or Track While Scan (TWS) mode. Targets will continue to be populated on subsequent sweeps. Up to 4 targets can be saved to memory for TWS.
* Center press twice to save the target to memory and simultaneously enter Single Target Tracking (STT). Alternatively, a tracked target can also be chosen for STT by pressing the corresponding bezel button. This mode locks the radar on the target to provide live tracking for launch authorization and guidance for the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]. This is visualized as a bolder and brighter colored green line. Information for the locked target is given in the bottom right.
** The unit's name 
** B: Bearing (Heading) 
** R: Range 
** A: Altitude
Untracked targets are erased from the screen and cannot be repopulated in this mode. However, the radar still seems to sweeping in the background to remember tracked targets. Double clicking again exits STT. Tracked targets are instantly brought back to the screen, while other targets are displayed as they are (re)discovered.
[[File:FA26B radar page.png|thumb|F/A-26B RADAR page]]

==== Buttons ====
* '''R(+/-)''': changes maximum range that will fit on the display. Beware that your radar signal still continues to move through space beyond the range displayed. Units that don't appear on your radar may detect your radar signal on their RWR. This only affects what is displayed.
* '''SCAN ANGLE''': Cycles through various horizontal sweep angles. The data is mapped  out to maximize screen utilization, so the player will not see the scan cone getting narrower. Instead the sweep beam cycles faster. The cone on the display is a relative measurement of angle, not the actual shape of the sweep cone. The vertical scan angle is seems to be almost 180 degrees, as all altitudes are visible from any reasonable nose pitch.
* '''UNLCK''': Unlocks the currently locked target, but does not erase it from memory.
* '''CLR''': Clears all tracked targets. Units will be repopulated on the next sweep.
* '''MODE''' toggles between a sweep and bore sight mode.

=== Boresight ===
Boresight fixes the radar forward and automatically locks onto the first target it sees. This search area is denoted by the circle on the HUD labeled "BORESIGHT" and reaches out to about 7.5&nbsp;km. This will immediately feed into the gun's fire solution or authorize a missile launch. In bore sight, holding center press on the controller will unlock the current target and prevent the radar from acquiring anything until released. The scan angle and range cannot be adjusted by the user as a compromise to allowing quick target acquisition when dog fighting within visual range (the range when IR missile start to become the better choice over AIM-120s)

== Anti-Radiation Attack Display (ARAD) ==
[[File:FA26B ARAD page.png|thumb|F/A-26B Anti-Radiation Attack Display (ARAD) page]]
This page is available to the AV-42C and F/A-26B. Units appearing on the [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)|RWR]] will also appear on this page. Units can be selected with the cursor to set them as a target for anti-radiation missiles, such as the [[AGM-88|AGM-88 HARM]]. The weapon range and launch authorization will appear or update the next time the target pings the player. For rotating [[Fire Control Radar]]s (SA, DS, MC, etc.), this may take about 2 seconds until the dish comes back around.

The HUD button toggles the appearance of green diamonds on HUD to mark the location radiation sources in the world. All types of radiation sources count, so this can be used to locate air units visible on RWR that have not appeared on the RADAR. The display is persistent even when the ARAD page is not on any MFD, allowing this to act as a passive way of detecting units, and as a way to visualize the RWR in 3D space.

== Spectator Camera (S-CAM) ==
[[File:FA26B S CAM page.png|thumb|F/A-26B S-CAM page]]
The desktop window defaults to mirroring one of the images from the headset. This screen provides the option to render a separate image from a different camera (extra performance overhead!). This camera will replace the desktop window's view, or be set to a second monitor.

Screenshots are saved in the VTOL VR directory in their own folder.

<br />
== GAME ==
[[File:FA26B Game page.png|thumb|F/A-26B GAME page]]

*'''QSAVE''': For making quicksaves and quickloading them.
* '''CENTER''': Allows the player to reset their VR position similar to the wrist watch button.
*'''RESTART''': Restarts the current scenario.
*'''EXIT''': returns the user to the main menu rather than exiting the game to desktop.
With the addition of the controller menu feature (Grip+Trigger+B/Y), this menu is made somewhat redundant.


== LOG ==
Logs game events such as unit destruction. If waved off by the LSO during a carrier landing, the cause of the wave-off will also be logged. The log can be saved for later viewing and debrief.           

== GPS ==
[[File:FA26B GPS page.png|thumb|F/A-26B GPS page]]
This is the destination of GPS-S (end) from other pages. GPS points are created and seen in the currently highlighted group. All points within a group can be sequentially connected by toggling PATH.

Arrows on the bezel allows a point to be highlighted for other actions. Chevron arrows on the lower right side of the screen allow the highlighted GPS point to be shifted up or down the list. 
* Deletion
* Slew the TGP to the point with TGP > GPS-Acquire

* Pressing WPT will set the highlighted GPS point as the current way point. In PATH mode, reaching the current WPT will automatically select the next point in sequence on the list and set it as WPT. This means that autopilot can also be used to fly a PATH automatically in order with no further user input. It also allows the [[AGM-161]] to fly the PATH set in the selected GPS group. 

==[[Targeting Pod (TGP)]]==
[[File:FA26B TGP page.png|thumb|F/A-26B TGP page]]
This page controls the targeting pod. The TGP on the F/A-26B is equipped as needed via the configuration hangar. The TGPs on the AV-42C and F-45A are built into the nose and therefore always equipped. In the case of the F-45A, this page is designated as EOTS (Electro-Optical Targeting System). It has to be powered on before the screen displays anything, but will stop rendering when the TGP displays to the visor.

== Onboard Cameras (CAM) ==
Cycle between outside views of the aircraft using '''PREV''' or '''NEXT''' .These can be used to check hardpoints and equipment, or view the undercarriage during taxi. This feature is available to the AV-42C and F/A-26B.

== Objectives (OBJ) ==
Objectives that have started appear here in white. They turn red if failed, and green if completed. 

Tallies and quotas for objectives appear here.

WPT sets the current way point to the objective if one is specified in the mission editor.

== Navigation (NAV) ==
[[File:FA26B NAV page.png|thumb|F/A-26B NAV page]]
Defaults to a MAP screen. Navigation related I/O mainly occurs through here.
*'''MODE''': toggles between fixing the map's orientation to "Up = North" or relative to the player orientation in the world as in "Up = forward".
*'''GPS''': A shortcut to open the GPS page. This button becomes MAP to return to this page.
*'''GPS-S''': Uses the screen center  and chosen altitude to create a GPS waypoint.
** ALT (+/-) is used to specify the altitude
** The MAP is normally centered on the player and moves with it. This behavior is turned off by using SOI or the bezel buttons. Cross hairs will appear to indicate where the screen is centered.

The left bezel has buttons that set a waypoint to important scenario related locations. These waypoints are configured in the mission editor.
* '''OBJ''': Sets the objective waypoint as the WPT. 
* '''RTB''': Sets the airbase as the WPT. The destination is specified in the mission editor. Players must manually land the aircraft.
* '''FUEL''': Sets the aerial tanker as the WPT. The tanker is configure in the mission editor. The NAV autopilot can navigate to the tanker within reason, but throttle and finalizing positioning for refueling needs to be done by the player.

== Communications and Radio (COMMS) ==
[[File:FA26B Comms page.png|thumb|F/A-26B COMMS page]]
The player can use this to command wingmen and communicate with your ATC.
* '''Wingmen'''
**'''Combat'''
***'''Attack Target''': Commands wingmen to attack the target currently locked and tracked by the TGP, Radar, or ARAD.
*** '''Engage''': wingmen will attack enemies at will. This locks out other commands and the wingmen are flagged as busy. 
*** '''Disengage''': wingmen will stop attacking and await orders.
** '''Flight'''
*** '''Orbit Here''': Wingmen break formation to orbit around the current location.
*** '''Form Up''': Units fly in formation with the player
*** '''Spread''': Changes spacing between aircraft in formation.
*** '''Go Refuel''': commands units to refuel from an aerial tanker designated in the mission editor.
*** '''RTB''': return to base. Units stop responding to commands once in a parked state.
*** '''RTB & Re-arm''': Return to base and rearm.
** '''Equipment'''
*** '''Radar''': Commands wing men to turn their radar on or off. This is independent of the Engage command, and units will use other weapons if possible. Useful for trying to avoid detection as units will path towards radar sources seen on their RWR.
* '''Ground'''
** '''Request Re-arm''': The player spawns outside the aircraft similar to the configuration hangar before loading the game.
* '''ATC'''
** '''Landing''': Request vectors and landing clearance to the nearest rearming point (airbase or carrier).
**# ATC gives the player a vector to intersect a line projected from the runway. The WPT is set to the ground at the end of the runway.
**# Once the player nears the intersection, they are cleared to turn towards the runway and land
**# The [[F/A-26B]] will also display ILS information on its Horizontal Situational Indicator.
**# Upon landing, WPT will be set to a rearming point. ATC will tell the player to taxi there.
** '''Takeoff''' (Carriers)
**# The player is assigned a catapult via waypoint, and as they are available
**# Once attached, the player is instructed to prepare for takeoff
**# The player may trigger the catapult by activating the afterburner
** '''Takeoff''' (Airbase)
**# The player is told to taxi to a runway as shown on the NAV and a waypoint on the HUD.
**# AI units will yield to the taxiing player, but the player will be told to hold short of the runway while AI fighters are taking off.
**# The player will be cleared for takeoff.
** '''Cancel''': Cancels the current request. This is important because you can affect the queue of ground operations of other units during taxi and takeoff. Units will attempt to land as long as the player is not fouling the runway and they will try to avoid colliding with other units.

== OPTION ==
[[File:FA26B options page.png|thumb|F/A-26B OPTION page]]
Allows the player to configure settings like the units used in distance and speed calculations along with flight stick orientation. The flight stick orientation option switches the aircraft between two flight stick modes:
* The flight stick is in the form of a joystick and is anchored to the right side of the aircraft. The ejection lever is in the center of the seat, right between the player's legs.
* The flight stick manifests in a more traditional form. It acts as a large lever in the center of the seat, between the player's legs. One ejection lever is available at each side of the seat.

== Equipment (EQUIP) ==
[[File:FA26B EQUIP page.png|thumb|F/A-26B EQUIP page]]
This shows pylon mounted equipment. Each weapon is mapped to a different bezel button. The '''MODE''' button allows the player to change the action of the these buttons.

* '''CONFIG:''' The bezel button''' '''opens a page to configure the weapon
* '''ARM: '''Allows players to toggle the arm state of the weapon. This overrides the master arm switch.
* '''JETTISON: '''allows the player to flag a weapon for an unarmed jettison state. Toggling again will remove the jettison flag from the weapon, and leave it in an unarmed state.
Pressing CONFIG will enter the configuration page for that weapon. Below are the modes available for each weapon type, or specific to a weapon.[[Category:Avionics]]

{{Stub}}[[File:Tracked Artillery Tank.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]The '''MPA-155''' is an alternative artillery unit available to the enemy faction. Unlike its cousin, the [[Rocket Artillery Truck]], this vehicle fires artillery shells and will only fire on specific waypoints when commanded to. Additionally, its reload speed cannot be configured.

MPA-155s fire in ''Salvos,'' and those salvos are based on two variables in their directives:
* ''Default Shots per Salvo ''- The amount of shots they make per salvo.
* ''Ripple Rate'' - The delay between the salvos they make in seconds.
For their firing solutions, the MPA-155s can be given one of four firing orders:
* ''Fire on Waypoint ''- The tank fires a salvo at a given waypoint.
* ''Fire Salvos on Waypoint ''- The tank fires a specific number of salvos at a given waypoint.
* ''Fire Salvos on Waypoint Radius ''- The tank fires a specific number of salvos at random points within a certain radius around the given waypoint.
* ''Fire on Unit'' - The tank fires a salvo at a specific unit target.

The MPA-155 has a maximum manual firing range of ~26 kilometers (14nm).

=== ''"A carrier-based unmanned aerial refueling vehicle. This tanker drone can be used to extend the range of naval air missions." -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The MQ-31 is a single-engine aerial-refueling drone aircraft. Unlike its cousin, the [[Air-to-air tanker|KC-49]], this drone is designed for naval operations and can launch from allied carriers. All allied aircraft can refuel on this drone, although players will find it much harder to refuel from it as opposed to the KC-49 due to its significantly smaller size. 

== Armament ==
[[File:UARV Refuelling FA26B.png|thumb|220x220px|An F/A-26B refueling from the MQ-31.]]
The MQ-31 cannot equip any weapons, but it does have external hardpoints for attaching optional fuel tanks if range is an issue.
* 2x Wing pylons
** 4600L Fuel Drop Tank - "A 4600L external fuel drop tank."

[[File:UcavOverIsland.jpg|thumb|220x220px|A UCAV flying over a mountain range.]]The Manta is a hostile Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle. It is launched from the enemy's own [[Drone Carrier]]. This unit is a viable unit option for easy defense or even being sent into hazardous areas where they would not be expected to survive. As such, it is commonly utilized in offensive contexts for combat support, or even just as a simple diversion. It is identifiable on the [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)]] as ''DF.''

Despite being designed to be launched from Drone Carriers, Manta UCAVs can be spawned individually in the [[Mission Editor]], though they cannot be spawned on the ground like other fighters. Additionally, individually-spawned UCAVs are able to be equipped with up to four Air-to-Ground Missiles.

[[File:MapEditor.jpg|thumb|319x319px]]
The Map Editor is an Editor program used for making maps in VTOL VR for use in the [[Mission Editor]].

== Main Menu ==
Upon loading up the Map Editor, two options will be available: '''New Map''' and '''Open Map.''' New Map opens up the setup page for generating new maps while Open Map allows creators to access saved maps for further modification.
[[File:NewMap.jpg|thumb|263x263px]]

=== New Map ===
The New Map UI is where new map bases (unaltered terrain) are configured for generation. The options chosen here cannot be adjusted after they are set. There are several different parameters that can be tweaked to change the map's properties:
* '''Terrain Type:''' Determines the type of map generated. Can be toggled between three different modes:
** '''''Archipelago:''''' Creates a water-based map with islands of varying size and density.
** '''''Mountain Lakes:''''' Creates a mountain-based map with large mountain ranges and scattered lakes. No water border is present in this type.
** '''''HeightMap:''''' A more complex type that allows for the generation of specifically-designed maps. More information in the HeightMap section below.
* '''Size:''' A slider option that determines the size of the map generated in square kilometers. Can be adjusted between 24&nbsp;km by 24&nbsp;km (slider value 8) and 196&nbsp;km by 196&nbsp;km (slider value 64).
* '''Biome:''' Sets the biome of the map, which affects the style of the terrain. There are three Biome options available:
** '''''Boreal:''''' Grasslands and scattered forests with snow-topped mountains. Trees are placed within the forest areas (patches of dark-green grass).
** '''''Desert:''''' Barren desert with sand fields and rocky mountains. Dead trees are scattered throughout the area.
** '''''Arctic:''''' Snowy tundra environment. No trees are generated, which could save loading time in certain setups.
* '''Seed:''' The map's Seed value used for determining the generation of the terrain (default value: ''seed''). This value can be copied down along with the config options to allow the map base to be shared. This value cannot be retrieved after the map's generation. There is also a Random button available for generating a random Seed value for your map.
* There are also two other sliders available for determining how your map is generated:
** '''Islands[sic] Size:''' Determines the size of the islands generated in your map. In the Mountain Lakes Terrain Type, this determines the frequency of lakes in your map.
** '''Mountain Height:''' Determines the maximum height ceiling for the mountains generated. At its maximum setting, it could result in mountains being generated with unnaturally flat peaks, giving off a mesa-type effect. This is due mostly in part to limitations in the game engine.

==== ''HeightMap'' ====
This Terrain Type option allows users to import their own Height Maps for configuration. The Seed option is replaced with a few new parameters for more adjusting the map's specifications to match the chosen Height Map:
* '''Border Type:''' This determines the border around the map. It is used for differentiating between different map types in the game. Three options are available:
** '''''Water:''''' The map is bordered by water on all sides. Used for creating island maps.
** '''''Hills:''''' The map is bordered by terrain on all sides. Used for creating landlocked maps.
** '''''Coast:''''' The map is bordered by land on all sides except one. This option allows for the creation of coastline maps. The coast can be set to one of four sides: ''North, East, South,'' or ''West.'' Everything beyond the direction your coastline is set to will be water, while every other border will have further land generated beyond it.
[[File:OpenMap.jpg|thumb|255x255px]]

=== Open Map ===
This area is for opening previously-generated maps for modification. The game's preset maps, such as ''CostaOeste'' and ''TestMapAlpha,'' will also be available for use through this area. The map of [[Akutan]], VTOL VR's "default map," is not accessible through the Map Editor though. It was designed individually and well before the Map Editor existed, and therefore is not compatible with it.

== Editor Overview ==
The Map Editor software contains a number of terrain tools for adjusting the terrain and adding in objects. Players can move around with the WASD keys and adjust the camera angle by holding right click and moving their mouse. There are three "Tabs" available in the top margin for adjusting a Map's metadata:
* '''File'''
** '''''Save:''''' Saves your Map as a file for later access.
** '''''Quit:''''' Returns to the Map Editor's main menu.
* '''Edit'''
** '''''Map Info:''''' Determines the ''Name'' and ''Description'' of your map, which show up when the Map is selected in the Open Map area.
* '''Steam'''
** '''''Upload:''''' Uploads your Map to the Steam workshop. Workshop page info can only be configured in the Workshop page itself after the Map is uploaded. This button is also used for updating the Map file on the Workshop after being uploaded.
For Map adjustment, there are three extra tabs in the right-hand margin.

=== Objects ===
This tab is used for manually adding objects into the Map. It is used mainly for adding [[Airbases]] (in the ''Bases'' category) and Docks (in the ''Coastal'' category) into a Map, but it can also be used to manually add in buildings as an alternative method to the City Painter Brush (see below).

=== Roads ===
This tab is used for inserting roads into a Map. There are two road options available: ''2-Lane Roads'' and ''4-Lane Roads.'' Roads are placed down as nodes that are automatically connected together. Roads are constructed based on three nodes placed down:
* Base node: This determines the starting point of your road strip.
* Midpoint node: This determines the curvature of your road.
* End node: This determines where your strip ends.
End nodes can be connected up to Base nodes to extend roads. Roads can also branch out from existing ones to create junctions. A road's height can be adjusted with Ctrl+Scroll, allowing bridges to be created. You can also to cancel the road creation by pressing space.

=== Terrain ===
[[File:HeightPaint.jpg|thumb|250x250px]]
This tab contains two Brush tools for modifying the Map. There are two Brushes available:
* '''Height Paint:''' This Brush is used for adjusting the shape of your Map. Holding Left Click raises the terrain while Shift+Left Click lowers terrain. There are three sliders available for adjusting the brush's behavior:
** '''''Radius:''''' Changes the radius of the Brush for adjusting larger swaths of terrain.
** '''''Strength:''''' Determines how quickly terrain is adjusted. Lower values allow for more fine-tuned terrain adjustments.
** '''''Shape:''''' Changes the "Shape" of your brush. Lower values make the Brush flatter while higher values make the brush much sharper towards the middle.
* '''City Paint:''' This Brush is used for placing down buildings in bulk for adding cities and towns into a Map. Holding Left Click adds in cities while Ctrl+Left Click removes cities. It works similarly to the Height Paint Brush, having the same ''Radius, Strength,'' and ''Shape'' options available, but it also has a range option available for determining the type of City painted down. The roads placed down in between buildings with this tool cannot be automatically connected up with the Roads placed down with the Road tool.

The '''Mission Editor''' is a built-in editing program used to create custom missions and campaigns. It can work with custom Maps created in the [[Map Editor]]. It can be accessed through VTOL VR's main menu with the Mission Editor button. Alternatively, it can also be accessed through a Mission Editor button on the monitor, which can be clicked with the mouse. 

== Main Menu ==
Upon opening the Mission Editor, there are three options available: '''Campaign Editor, Standalone Mission,''' and '''Steam Workshop.''' Standalone Mission allows for the creation of individual Missions, Campaign Editor allows for the creation of multiple Missions packaged up into a Campaign, and Steam Workshop allows custom Maps to be picked from the Workshop for use in the Mission Editor.

=== Campaign Editor ===
The Campaign Editor window lets players create a new Campaign or access an existing one for editing. Selecting '''New Campaign''' will allow players create a new Campaign file, determining the Campaign's filename and vehicle beforehand.

The Campaign Editor UI allows players to set up the structure of their Campaigns.

=== Standalone Mission ===
The Standalone Mission UI allows players to create new Standalone Missions or edit existing ones. 

=== Steam Workshop ===
The Steam Workshop button allows custom maps to be downloaded through the Workshop for use in Missions.

== Multiplayer Campaigns ==
To set up a Multiplayer Campaign in the Mission Editor, open the Campaign Editor from the Main Menu, select ''New Campaign...'', check the Multiplayer Box, and click save after naming the campaign file. Checking the Multiplayer option disables the Vehicle option, as that is set for each individual ''player slot'' later on. Individual Multiplayer campaigns can also be used for individual missions. 

== Overview ==

==== Unit value ====
Units in editor are in '''meters''' for altitude & distance, '''meters/seconds''' for speed and '''seconds''' for time.

=== Controls ===
[[File:MissionEditor.jpg|thumb|332x332px|alt=|The Mission Editor's UI.]]
==== ''Camera'' ====

* Rotation: Right-click + Mouse movement.
* Zoom: Scroll wheel. ''Zooms relative to the Editor Cursor, not the Mouse cursor.''

==== ''Cursor'' ====

* Movement: WASD or Arrow keys.
* Fast Movement: Shift + Movement.
* Drag World: Middle-Click + Mouse movement.
*Drag Rotation: Shift + Middle-Click.
* Teleport: Double-Click.
* Rotation: Q, E. ''Rotates the Editor Cursor.''
*Change Altitude: Shift + Scroll wheel, or Z (Decrease altitude) or X (Increase altitude).

==== ''Shortcuts'' ====

* New Unit: '''U'''
*Validate new unit / Position : '''Space'''
*Measure tool : '''R'''

The Editor Cursor is where the camera view is centered about. It is also the point used as the center for placing Units, Objects, Way Points, or other Editor modules.

=== Top Menu Bar ===

==== ''File'' ====

* Save: Saves the current Mission file. ''Shortcut: Ctrl+S.''
* Save As...: Saves the current Mission file as a new file. ''Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+S.''
* New: Resets the map to its default state, clearing all Units, Way Points, etc. for a new Mission. ''Shortcut: Ctrl+N.''
* Open: Opens up the Mission file selection UI. ''Shortcut: Ctrl+O.''
* Quit: Closes the Scenario Editor and returns to the Mission Editor's Main Menu. ''No shortcut available.''

==== ''Edit'' ====

* Scenario Info: Opens up the Scenario Info UI for the current Mission. ''Shortcut: Ctrl+I.'' 
**''Main article:'' ''[[Mission Editor/Scenario Info]]''
* Global Values: Opens up the Global Values UI. Used for setting Variables in the Mission Editor. ''No shortcut available.''
**''Main article:'' ''[[Mission Editor/Global Values]]''

==== ''View'' ====

* Minimap: Opens up a Minimap UI for map navigation. Zooms up to 1 time inwards and 8 times outwards, relative to its starting zoom value. A button at the lower-right corner of the Minimap allows its size to be changed. ''Shortcut: Ctrl+M.''
* Recenter: Moves the Editor Cursor to the map's origin point. ''No shortcut available.''

==== ''Tools'' ====

* Measure: Enables the Mission Editor's measuring tool. Click a point on the terrain and drag your mouse out to measure out distance from one point to another. It also displays a circle, whose radius is represented by the line drawn. Two values are shown in the top margin: the direction the line is pointing towards and the length of the line itself. Useful for determining the desired ratio for Triggers. ''Shortcut: R.''
* Repack Map: Updates the Mission's associated map file with the latest copy available in the Map Editor. May result in Units or Triggers being displaced over or underneath newly adjusted terrain. ''No shortcut available.''

==== ''Launch'' ====

* Launch Scenario: Opens up the Scenario Launcher UI for testing created missions. Players can choose their Profile and set Invincible on if desired for testing purposes. ''Shortcut: Ctrl+L.''

==== ''Steam'' ====

* Upload: Publishes a Mission to Steam. Workshop page details must be configured separately. ''No shortcut available.''

==== ''Help'' ====

* Controls: Displays the Editor Controls reference UI. ''No shortcut available.''

=== Right Menu Bar ===

====''Units''====
This tab allows for the placement of Units. Click the New Unit button and a UI will pop up where you can choose a Unit to place down. The Unit you choose will spawn in at the Editor Cursor's position facing towards the Cursor's direction.

A cog will also be located within each unit's space in the list; clicking it will bring up the Unit's config options. This UI can be used to set a Unit's AI behavior, their armament, etc. 

====''Paths''====
The Path tab allows the player to place down Paths, which can be used for unit navigation or as GPS point paths for the player to follow. A path consists of a list of points connected sequentially down the list. The Path Mode option changes the way in which the points are chained together. Its default option is "Smooth", but it can also be set to "Linear" or "Bezier" to change the way the path's curves are represented. There is also an option to reverse the order they are listed, which flips the points around on the list. The Loop option connects the first and last point to create a continuous circuit. This is useful for creating continuous patrol routes for Units to move through.

====''Waypoints''====
The Waypoints tab allows players to place down Waypoints on the map. A Waypoint consists of coordinates and an altitude. The coordinates alone would snap the Waypoint to the ground. The altitude specifies how high to raise the point above the ground. Waypoints can be used... 

* To program GPS targets when sent to the player through Events > Actions > System > Send wpt to GPS.
* As targets for artillery, bomber, and other unit attacks.
* As the landing spot for a VTOL.
* As the point a trigger zone should be centered about.

====''Events''====
The Events tab is for adding in Events, which function as triggers for unit orders and other game responses. Events are a sequence of actions in triggered, timed, or sequential variants. Events have a "Begin" state that can trigger immediately upon starting the scenario, after a certain amount of time, or even manually through other Events. 

[[Mission Editor/Events|''Main Article: Mission Editor/Events'']]
====''Objectives''====
Missions use Objectives to direct the player's actions and goals. They can also score actions with money which carrier over to other missions in a campaign. Objectives can be viewed by the player on the MFCD and there is a notification on the HUD for new objectives.

''[[Mission Editor/Objectives|Main Article: Mission Editor/Objectives]]''

==== ''Bases'' ====
Bases (airbases) offer a number of services to players and air units, such as rearming and refueling. These interact with the existing bases added through the Map Editor and can be used to determine two airbase properties:

* '''Name''' - Determines the name of the airbase, visible in the MFCD comms menu.
* '''Side''' - Determines whether the airbase is Allied- or Enemy-occupied. Allied units cannot land at enemy airbases and vice-versa.

====''Static Objects''====
Static Objects are decorative objects that can be set up per mission. These can be used to set up bases, helipads, and even ''oil rigs,'' which are the only semi-destructible objects in the game.

=== Bottom Bar ===
This bar provides a few miscellaneous resources for cursor map navigation:

* Cursor Heading: Displays the Heading (direction) the Editor Cursor is pointed towards. Can be given a specific Heading to point towards with the included text box.
* Cursor State: Displays what surface the cursor is currently on: Ground, Sea, or Air.
* Cursor Coordinates: Provides the current coordinates the cursor is located at, relative to the lower-leftmost corner of the map. Displayed in geographic coordinate notation.
* Altitude(m): Displays the cursor's current Altitude in Meters. ''MSL'' represents sea-level-relative altitude while ''AGL'' represents ground-relative altitude. The values can be manually set with one of the included text boxes. You can also set these boxes to display in imperial units (feet) by clicking on the unit and vice-versa.

== Alternate spawn points ==
Units can have alternative spawn points, which can be useful to improve replay-ability of a mission.

* Spawn 1 is the unit, while Spawn 2, Spawn 3, Spawn 4 etc... are the alternate spawn points.
* Each alternate spawn point has its own behavior setting (ex: you can spawn a tank parked on Spawn 1, but on a patrol path if it spawns on Spawn 2). Keep in mind that grouped unit can only realize order given via event to their UnitGroup.
* Alternate spawn point weight determinate how much chance that spawn point has against the other points to be selected on spawning. Having 2 spawn point at 100 means 50% chance for each.
* When Sync group is enabled, it makes all units of the group to spawn on the same selected alternate spawn point number.  Sync grouping '''will automatically create the same amount of alternate spawn point''' '''on all unit at each unit position if they don't already exist''', so make sure to select and move the spawn points at the proper location, (ex: Spawn 2 of each unit are around the farm, Spawn 3 of each unit are around  the city, etc...). Also make sure the '''Spawn immediately''' setting of your alt spawn point is matching the one used by spawn 1 (in case you want to spawn the group manually).
[[File:Alt spawn.png|center|thumb|333x333px|alt=|Example of group sync alternate spawn points]]

== Mission testing ==
''Main article: [[VTOL VR Wiki:How To Take In-Game Pictures]]''

Mission makers can use the Developer Camera to observe and debug the behaviors of their AI without actually joining the Mission itself. To launch a Mission without using a headset:

# Make sure equipment is not configurable in the '''Scenario Info''' (to avoid the loadout screen)
# Press '''R''' to skip the "Equip Helmet" screen

Events are the main system for mission flow within Scenarios created on the Mission Editor. There are three types of Events available to use: '''Timed, Trigger, and Sequence.''' Events can be combined with other aspects of the [[Mission Editor]] in order to provide a logical flow of event actions for any Scenario.

==Event Types==

===Timed===

Timed Events run specific actions for a certain period of time. They are classified as Event Groups and can trigger multiple actions in a single group, each with different relative timing. Checking "Begin Immediately" will cause the Event to trigger automatically at the start of the mission. Timed Events can contain an unlimited number of "events" inside; each event can trigger multiple actions at once. The Event Group itself can be given an Initial Delay in seconds, which adds a delay before the Event Group's activation. Each Event within the Group can be given a Time value (also in seconds), which determine how long the Event runs for before moving to the next one.

===Trigger===

Trigger Events are arguably the simplest kind of Events available. They run a single group of actions when triggered, and are usually used for less complex action chains. Trigger Events have two Trigger Type options: ''Proximity'' and ''Conditional.'' ''Proximity'' allows the Event to be automatically triggered once a unit enters or exits range of a specified Waypoint. It can also be specified if the Trigger can be set off by the player, a specific unit, any allies, any enemies, or any unit at all. The Trigger's Event Mode has two options for the Trigger behavior: onEnter and onExit; the former causes the Event to trigger once a unit enters the area while the latter triggers the Event after a unit leaves. A radius around the Waypoint can also be set to determine the Trigger area's size; it takes on a cylinder shape by default, but the Spherical Radius checkbox can change the shape to a sphere instead if desired. ''Conditional'' allows more complex trigger conditions to be set in place using the Condition Editor (see the Condition Editor section for more info).

===Sequence===

Event Sequences run one event after another with customizable timing and enter/exit conditions per Event. Checking "Begin Immediately" will cause the Event to trigger automatically at the start of the mission. Event Sequences are composed of Nodes which, like with Timed Events, can run an unlimited amount of Actions at once. The Nodes in Event Sequences, however, can be given Entry and Exit conditions, which must be fulfilled for the Node to run or to move to the next Node respectively. A gray box with a line in it can be dragged up or down the Event Sequence to change the Node order as needed.

==Conditional Editor==

The Conditional Editor is used by certain Events to act as a gateway for Actions to wait at until a condition is fulfilled before they can activate. It is represented as a table of sorts in which different nodes can be chained together to form different types of conditions. By default, a lone output node is present in the middle of the table; it cannot be deleted, but it can be moved if necessary. The available nodes to use are as follows: 

==== ''Logic'' ====

* AND: Has a minimum of two inputs (more can be added/removed as desired) and one output. All inputs must be ''true'' in order for the output to move forward.
* OR: Has a minimum of two inputs (more can be added/removed as desired) and one output. At least one input must be ''true'' in order for the output to move forward.

==== ''Conditions'' ====

* Unit: Checks the properties of a single unit and determines whether the relevant state is true (IS) or false (IS NOT).
* Unit Group: Same as Unit, but it checks an entire unit Group instead. Cannot be used to check multiple units at once.
* Unit List: Same as Unit Group, but can check through a custom list of individual units.
* Static Object: Used exclusively to check whether or not a specified Oil Rig Object has been destroyed.
* Chance: Has a chance of outputting, whose percentage number is determined by a slider or a text box included.
* Vehicle Control: Reads a value from the player's aircraft, such as their fuel level or if a certain button is pressed, and outputs based on the configuration.
* Global Value: Reads a Global Value and compares it to a given number. Outputs if the [[Mission Editor/Global Values|Global Value]] is greater than, less than/ or equal to the given number.

== Event Action Browser ==
Event Actions are used to control the actions and behavior of units among other Scenario functions.

{{Scrollbox <!--This Template is used for containing this massive amount of text within a dedicated box to save space on the page.-->
| content===='''Universal Unit Actions'''===

*Set Engage Enemies: Set whether the unit should engage enemies at all.
*Spawn Unit: Spawns the unit if it hasn't already been spawned (does not duplicate units)
*Destroy: This event destroys the unit immediately. Depending on the unit, their model will eventually despawn.
*Set Invincible: Set whether the unit can take damage. Allied units have collisions with each other disabled in formation as AI is tweaked.

=== Unit Actions (Player) ===

* Set Waypoint: Set the player's current Waypoint.
* Kill Pilot: Kill the pilot instantaneously (as if killed by g-forces or impact).
* Destroy Vehicle: Destroy the player's vehicle without killing the pilot.

In multiplayer missions, '''MP Spawn''' is used instead, and has a different set of functions:
* Move Spawn: Moves the player slot's spawn point to the given location. Bearing, start mode, and initial speed can be reconfigured as well.
* Set RTB Waypoint: Sets/Moves the player slot's RTB waypoint to the given waypoint.
* Set RTB Unit: Sets the unit used for the player slot's RTB waypoint. Used for carriers.
* Set RTB To Spawn: Sets the player slot's RTB waypoint to their spawn point location.
* Set Fuel Waypoint: Sets the player slot's Fuel waypoint to the given waypoint value.
* Set Fuel Unit: Sets the player slot's Fuel waypoint to the given unit. Used for carriers or specific tankers.

===Unit Actions (Air)===

*Set Unit Commands: Exclusive to allied aircraft. Sets whether or not this unit will accept commands given by the player.
*Set Path: Set the aircraft to fly along a path.
*Taxi Path: Command the aircraft to taxi on a certain path.
*Taxi Path Speed: Command the aircraft to taxi on a certain path at a certain speed.
*Orbit Waypoint: Command the aircraft to orbit a way point at a specified radius and altitude.
*Set Nav Speed: Set the aircraft's default navigation airspeed (when not in combat)
*Set Altitude: Set the aircraft's default altitude. AI will still take into account ground collision
*Form on Pilot: Command the aircraft to form up on a particular air unit regardless of faction or grouping
*Refuel From Tanker: Command the aircraft to refuel from the specified tanker aircraft.
*Fire ASM: Command an aircraft to fire an [[AGM-89 Anti-ship Cruise Missile|Anti-Ship Missile]] on the given path if available.
*Take Off: Command the pilot to take off. At an airbase or carrier, a plane will automatically follow ATC procedures, or vertical take off if possible from a helipad. When not at an airbase, the fixed wing will attempt to use the ground in front of it for takeoff roll or vertical take off.
*Land: Land at a specified airfield.
*Land at WPT: Vertically land on a specified waypoint if capable.
*Land at WPT w/ Direction: Same as Land at WPT, but takes in a bearing value for the unit to face towards when landing.
*Rearm: A combination of actions being Land, rearm/refuel, and take off again.
*Attack Target: Orders the unit to attack a specific target, regardless of detection or other threats. This overrides priority targets until the target is destroyed.
*Cancel Attack Target: Clears the unit's designated Attack Target.
*Set Radio Comms: Set whether the AI pilot will communicate with the player via radio.
*Add Priority Targets: Adds selected unit(s) to the AI pilot's priority target list. They will attack these before other when those targets are detected.
*Set Priority Targets: Sets or Replaces the AI pilot's priority target list to a new list populated by selected units.
*Clear Priority Targets: Clears the AI pilot's priority target list.
*Add Non-Targets: Specifies hostile units that this unit should not engage under any circumstances.
*Set Non-Targets: Same as Add Non-Targets, but it clears any existing lists beforehand.
*Clear Non-Targets: Clears the unit's Non-Target list.
*Bomb waypoint: Carpet bomb the waypoint from a certain heading and altitude, and with a certain number of bombs. The pilot will automatically configure ripple rate and release timing to center the line of bombs over the waypoint.
*Set Radar: Toggles the unit's radar on or off if it has one. This functions independently of a unit's ''Engage Enemies'' property, meaning units can be set to attack while maintaining radar silence to avoid detection.

The following functions are exclusive to the [[AV-42C]]:

*Unload Passengers: Causes all passengers inside the AV-42C to exit the vehicle if the ship is landed.
*Load Passengers: Orders specific [[Infantry]]men to approach and board the AV-42C.
*Load Unit Group: Orders an Infantry group to approach and board the AV-42C.

===Unit (Ground)===

*Set Movement Speed: Determines the unit's designated Move Speed. Players can choose between three movement speed options: ''Slow (10), Medium (20), ''or ''Fast (30).'' The number designates its movement speed in meters per second.
*Set Path: Orders a unit to move along a given path.
*Park Now: Cancels all present move orders and orders the unit to remain in place.
*Move To: Orders a unit to move directly to a waypoint.

===Unit (Sea)===

*Launch All: Applies to any unit with a configurable deck aircraft storage (Edit Carrier setting). Commands all onboard aircraft to take off. Scrambles the aircraft assigned to the carrier via the "Edit Carrier" sub menu.
*Launch Drones: Exclusive to the [[Drone Carrier]]. Causes it to launch all of its stored drones if they're available.
*Move to: Commands the vessel to move directly to a given waypoint.
*Move Path: Commands the vessel to move along a path.

===UnitGroup===
Similar to the actions used for individual units, but given to each unit within a group.
===Objective===

*Begin Objective: Starts the objective if it has not already been completed.
*Complete Objective: Marks the objective as completed if it has not yet been finished already.
*Fail Objective: Marks the objective as failed. If the objective in question is listed as required, then it will trigger a total mission failure.
*Cancel Objective: Stops the objective without completing or failing it.

===Timed/Sequence Events===

*Begin: Starts the event sequence.
*Stop: Stops the event sequence or prevents it from being triggered if it hasn't yet been.

===Trigger Events===

*Enable: Arms the Trigger event, allowing it to be triggered if its conditions are met.
*Disable: Disarms the Trigger event, preventing it from being triggered by its inputted trigger logic.
*Trigger: Triggers the event regardless of whether or not it is armed.

===System===

*Radio Message: Plays an audio clip over the player's radio comms system. Queues a radio message up if one is already playing.
*Play Priority Message: Similar to Radio Message, but it stops any currently-playing radio messages beforehand, giving the designated audio clip maximum priority.
*Stop Radio Messages: Immediately stops the currently-playing radio message and clears the radio message queue.
*Radio Message Team: ''Multiplayer mission exclusive.'' Plays a radio message for only the given team to hear.
*Copilot Radio Message: ''Multiplayer mission exclusive.'' Plays a radio message on the copilot audio channel.
*Copilot Priority Radio Message: ''Multiplayer mission exclusive.'' Plays a radio message on the copilot audio channel, giving the designated audio clip maximum priority.
*Fire Conditional Action: A very useful Event Action that triggers other Event Actions based on given IF, ELSE IF, and ELSE statements. Useful in conjunction with the Mission Editor's Global Values system.
*Play BGM: Plays an audio clip on a loop in the background. This functions independently of a ship's radio comms.
*Stop BGM: Fades out any currently-playing background music.
*Send WPT to GPS: Creates and sends a GPS group to the player's GPS tab (MSN prefix). The points are designated by inputted Mission Editor waypoints.
*Send Path to GPS: Creates and sends a GPS group to the player's GPS tab (MSN prefix). The path is determined by a given Mission Editor path and the GPS's Path mode is enabled for these points by default.
*Light Flare: Creates a flare at a designated map position. Its color and duration can be set beforehand.
*Add Score: ''Multiplayer mission exclusive.'' Adds a certain amount of points to the given team's Score.
*Force Quicksave: Causes the game to quicksave. It bypasses any predetermined quicksave limitations, making it useful as an autosave feature.
*Force Quickload: Causes the game to quickload if there is a quicksave available.

Global Values are a way of forming advanced Scenario flow behavior. They are often used for coding in more advanced conditions for [[Mission Editor/Events|Events]] using a variety of different inputs. Global Values can be changed through Event Actions and checked by the Conditional Editor's Global Value Node.  

== Configuration ==
Global Values can be set up through the Global Values screen in the Toolbar (Edit - Global Values). The Global Values screen allows new Global Values to be added or existing ones to be changed or deleted as desired. They can be given a name, a description, and an initial value through the GUI.

Objectives are the primary way to track player progress in the mission. They show up in-game on the OBJ page of the [[MFD]]. They will also show up briefly on the HUD when an Objective is started, completed, or failed. For multiplayer missions, Objectives are created separately for Team A and Team B.

To create an Objective, select the '''Objectives''' tab, select the appropriate team (if the mission is multiplayer), then click '''New'''.

== Objective Editor ==
There are several overarching properties for Objectives, which can be found in the left panel:
*'''Name''' - The name of the objective is shown in yellow at the top of the Objective Editor. By default, it will be called "New Objective". Click the '''Rename''' button to change it. The Objective's name can be seen in-game on the HUD popup, and in the OBJ MFD page.
*'''Objective Type''' - Determines the Type of Objective used, determining the properties denoted in the right panel. Properties are indicated by '''[bold square brackets]'''.
**'''''Destroy:''''' "Player must destroy at least '''[Min''' '''Required]''' units to complete this [objective]. The value of the minimum requirement will be clamped to the total amount of selected units. At least one '''[Destroy Targets]''' must be selected. The objective's base budget reward is given when the minimum is completed. The '''[Full Completion Bonus]''' is given in addition to that when all units are destroyed."
**'''''Pick Up:''''' "Player must pick up at least '''[Min Required]''' units to complete this [objective]. At least one '''[Pickup Targets]''' must be selected. Only certain units can be picked up. The value of the minimum requirement will be clamped to the total amount of selected units. The objective's base budget reward is given when the minimum is completed. The '''[Full Completion Bonus]''' is given in addition to that when all units are picked up."
**'''''Drop Off:''''' "This [should usually] be paired with a Pick-Up objective. Player must drop off at least '''[Min Required]''' units at the objective waypoint to complete this [objective]. An objective waypoint is required. Units will unload when the player is within '''[Unload Radius]''' from the waypoint. Once the units are dropped off, they will be directed to the '''[Dropoff Rally Point]'''. At least one '''[Drop Off Targets]''' must be selected. Only certain units can be picked up. The value of the minimum requirement will be clamped to the total amount of selected units. The objective's base budget reward is given when the minimum is completed. The '''[Full Completion Bonus]''' is given in addition to that when all units are picked up."
**'''''Fly To:''''' "Player must fly at least '''[Radius]''' meters from the waypoint to complete this objective. An objective waypoint is required. By default, the altitude component of distance is ignored. Set '''[Spherical Radius]''' to take altitude into account."
**'''''Join:''''' "The objective is completed when the player flies within '''[Radius]''' of the '''[Target Unit]'''. A '''[Target Unit]''' is required. If the objective does not have a waypoint set, it will automatically be set to the '''[Target Unit]'''."
**'''''Land:''''' "Player needs to land within '''[Radius]''' of the objective to complete this objective. An Objective waypoint is required."
**'''''Refuel:''''' "The '''[Refuel Target]''' units selected must be refueled to at least '''[Fuel Level]''' to complete this objective. At least one '''[Refuel Target]''' must be selected."
**'''''Protect:''''' "Player must prevent '''[Target]''' unit from being destroyed until the unit moves within '''[Radius]''' of the objective OR until the objective completion has been triggered. (Depending on '''[Completion Mode]''') Both '''[Target]''' and objective waypoint are required."
**'''''Conditional:''''' "Objective is completed when '''[Success Condition]''' returns true. It is failed if there is a '''[Fail Condition]''' and it returns true."
*'''Start Mode''' - Determines how/when the objective starts.
**'''''Immediate:''''' The objective starts immediately after launching the mission.
**'''''Triggered:''''' The objective never starts on its own. It must be started using an event action.
**'''''Prerequisite:''''' The objective starts when the designated objectives have been completed.
**'''''Final:''''' The objective starts when all other objectives have been completed.
*'''Waypoint''' - Sets the objective's waypoint. Required for certain objective types.
*'''Auto-Set Waypoint''' - Determines whether or not the objective moves the player's current waypoint to the one selected above when the objective is started. Off by default.
*'''Required''' - Determines whether or not the objective required to complete the mission. If on, the objective must be completed (or canceled) for the mission to complete, and failing the objective will fail the mission. If off, the objective can be skipped, and failing the objective will not fail the mission. On by default.
*'''Completion Reward''' - Determines the amount of money awarded to the player for objective completion. Used primarily for campaign missions.
*'''Objective Info''' - The description of the objective. This can be read by players in-game in the OBJ MFD page. It is limited to 80 characters.
*'''Events''' - Determines the actions run when the objective is in certain states.
**'''''Start Event:''''' Actions performed when the objective starts.
**'''''Completed Event:''''' Actions performed when the objective is completed.
**'''''Failed Event:''''' Actions performed when the objective is failed.

The Scenario Info UI is used for determining the overarching settings and info for the current Scenario. It can be accessed through Edit - Scenario Info, and is also displayed whenever the player uses the New function (File - New) to create a new Scenario.

== Contents ==

=== Scenario Info ===

* Title: the name of the Mission.
* Description: the Mission's description. If the Mission is published to the Workshop, it is used as the default Item description text.
* Image: the cover image used for the Mission. Image files must be placed in the EditorResources folder to be used.

=== Settings ===

* Vehicle: Determines the vehicle the player uses for the Scenario. Will be unchangeable if working with a Campaign Mission.
* Training Mission: If checked, the Mission will be available in the Training tab.
* Equipment: Determines Mission-specific Equipment regulations. There are two checkboxes in this section: Configurable and Forced Equips.
** Configurable allows the player to configure their loadout before the mission. Certain munitions can be disabled for that Mission with the Allowed Equips UI. When unchecked, Equipment Configuration is bypassed; the player's starting fuel level percentage can also be determined while this option is unchecked.
** Forced Equipment forces the player's vehicle to be equipped with certain munitions that cannot be altered in Equipment Config (when Configurable is enabled). If Configurable is disabled, the player bypasses Equipment Configuration and starts with the designated munitions equipped.
* RTB Waypoint: The Waypoint the player is directed towards when they press the RTB button on their GPS.
* Refuel Waypoint: The Waypoint the player is directed towards when they press the Refuel button on their GPS.
* Bullseye: The Bullseye Waypoint that the AWACS uses for Bullseye-relative Callouts. Shows on the GPS and TSD.
* Briefing: Configures the Scenario's pre-mission Briefing.
* Base Budget: The amount of money that the player has available for allocating their armaments in Equipment Configuration for this Mission.
* Environment: Changes the time of day the Scenario takes place in. Can be set to '''Morning, Day,''' or '''Night.'''
** Optional Env[ironment]: Allows the player to determine the time of day in Equipment Configuration.
* Quick Save: Determines the desired Quicksave functionality for the Scenario. Can be set to '''Anywhere, Rearm Only''' (when the player is landed at a rearming point), or '''None.''' The slider below it determines how many Quicksaves are available for the player to make in the Mission; it can be set to any value between -1 and 100, where -1 signifies unlimited Quicksaves. A value can also be typed in at the right, but any values outside the range of -1 to 100 will default back to -1.

Different settings are shown when configuring multiplayer missions.
* Separately configurable team A (Allied) and B (Enemy) values:
** RTB Waypoint
** Refuel Waypoint
** Bullseye
** Budget
** {{Tooltip|Score [Per] Kill|The amount of points awarded to the given team when an enemy unit is killed.}}
** {{Tooltip|Score [Per] Death|The amount of points awarded to the opposite team when an allied unit is killed.}}
* Briefing: Configures the Scenario's pre-mission Briefing. If Separate Briefings is checked, each team will be given their own separately configurable briefings.
* Auto Player Count: Automatically sets the player limits for each team for balancing. When unchecked, hard limits can be manually set using the sliders below.
* Environment: Changes the time of day the Scenario takes place in. Can be set to '''Morning, Day,''' or '''Night.'''
** Optional Env[ironment]: Allows the game host to determine the time of day in Equipment Configuration.

The Mk. 82AIR High Drag Bomb is a variant of the standard [[Mk. 82 Bomb]] available for the [[AV-42C]] and [[F/A-26B]] to utilize. It is equipped with a drogue chute in the back that deploys promptly after its release. The main use of this bomb as opposed to its counterpart is use in low-altitude bombing tactics. It is designed to resolve an old dilemma with unguided bombs: if a bomb is dropped from a very low altitude, the deploying aircraft runs a high risk of getting caught in the bomb's explosion themselves as the bomb will impact its target right as the aircraft is passing over it. The Mk. 82AIR bomb is built to solve this problem in the battlefield; once dropped, it quickly deploys a drogue chute behind itself. This slows its horizontal velocity enough without impacting its vertical drop-speed so that the deploying aircraft can move away from the target before the bomb's impact. Its deployment and tactical employment are largely identical to the standard Mk. 82 otherwise.

===''"Standard un-guided[sic] 500lb bomb." -- In-Game Description''===
The Mk. 82 Bomb is a generic free-fall bomb available for all playable aircraft except the [[AH-94]]. Its simplicity of use makes it effective for tactics such as carpet bombing. When active, it shows a vertical line across the HUD. The marker showing where the bomb will hit is at the bottom of this line, commonly referred to as the CCIP pipper. The entire system is referred to as the Constantly Computed Impact Point, or CCIP. The Mk. 82 has three main deployment techniques available:
* CCIP Dive-Bombing: This mode makes use of the Mk. 82's CCIP HUD pipper for a direct attack method. To do this, fly to ~5,000 feet above your target, immediately dive down towards them, and pull the trigger to release a bomb once the CCIP marker is over them.
* [[Targeting Pod (TGP)|TGP]]-Assisted Bombing: This mode is useful for hitting stationary targets in close proximity to one another, or for improving the accuracy of carpet-bombing runs. To do this, open up the TGP panel on one of your MFDs and set its mode to 'PIP' (Predicted Impact Point) to track the bomb's impact point more precisely. Line up with your target(s) and pull the trigger once your TGP's crosshair is over your desired target. TGP bombing is useful when diving is impractical.
* CCRP (Constantly-Calculated Release Point) Bombing: This mode is the most sophisticated deployment method for unguided bombs, allowing for strong accuracy against targets, stationary or otherwise. To use this mode, ensure that the Mk. 82's CCRP functionality is enabled in your aircraft's EQUIP MFCD page beforehand. Open up the TGP page and click the SOI button so you can slew the targeting crosshair over a desired ground target. This will create a dotted line on your HUD (the CCRP line); this is your steering cue. Line up the Mk. 82's CCIP reticle as closely with the CCRP line as closely as possible and hold your aircraft steady on your approach. As the CCIP marker nears the target, a diamond icon will crawl down the CCRP line towards two carats. Once the diamond is in between the carats, the CCIP is over the target (or at least within appropriate launch distance from them); pull the trigger once everything is lined up for an accurate bomb drop. CCRP bombing is a valuable tactic if one wishes to deploy unguided bombs against moving ground targets, such as convoys or naval ships, as the calculations account for the target's movement. Using AUTO CCRP allows you to hold the trigger in advance, with the computer releasing the bomb at the perfect moment. This mode works well for precise bombing runs against single targets, but if absolute precision against multiple targets is more necessary to your tactics, you may wish to opt to use a [[GBU-38 Bomb|GBU-38]] instead.

=== ''"Standard unguided 1000lb bomb."  -- In-Game Description'' ===
The Mk. 83 Bomb is a variant of the standard [[Mk. 82 Bomb]] with a {{Tooltip|1000lb|~454 kg}} payload as opposed to the Mk. 82's {{Tooltip|500lb|~227 kg}} payload. Its sheer weight means that only one Mk. 83 can be deployed per pylon as opposed to the maximum 3 bombs per pylon of the Mk. 82's rack. This bomb functions well for when pilots want to achieve better quality over quantity with their tactics; a single Mk. 83 can easily destroy bigger targets like enemy naval ships with a single good impact.

VTOL VR has an official multiplayer function. Multiplayer has support for all aircraft, a dedicated voice chat feature, and Steam Workshop compatibility. Servers can be joined or created from the multiplayer menu.

== Lobby Setup ==
[[File:Multiplayer_Lobby_Config.jpg|thumb|right|500px|An example Lobby configuration prior to launching a server]]
When creating a server, the player creating it becomes the host, and the server is hosted through their computer. The server host can configure the lobby name, game mode, lobby privacy settings, briefing room mode, in-game time of day (if applicable), and the visibility of unit icons.

== Preset Missions ==
* F/A-26B Dogfight
* F/A-26B Dogfight w/ Heatseeker Missiles
* AV-42C Deathmatch
* PVP Beyond Visual Range (BVR) Deathmatch
* PVP Strike Mission
* PVE F-45A Co-op Mission
* PVE F/A-26B Naval Strike

== Voice Chat ==
The multiplayer voice chat system is controlled using a panel at the right-hand side of the cockpit. A knob on the panel controls the microphone, switching between three different transmission modes: '''ON, PTT, and OFF.''' ON allows for constant voice transmission, while OFF prevents all possible voice transmission. PTT stands for ''Push To Talk,'' and only transmits the player's voice while the flight stick is gripped and a button on the controller is held--alternatively, players can interact with a hidden control on their neck to transmit their voices while in PTT mode.

Additionally, another knob allows for using one of two channels for voice chat: '''TEAM and GLOBAL.''' When the knob is set to TEAM, the player's voice will only be transmitted to teammates. When set to global, the player's voice will be transmitted to ''teammates and enemies alike.''

== Multiplayer Logistics ==
=== Player List ===
The player list can be accessed within the cockpit by going to the GAME page on an MFD and selecting PLAYERS. A list of the players currently in the server and on a team will be shown on the MFD page. The MANAGE button causes the player list to pop out from the MFD and render in front of the player's face in the cockpit. Here, players from the list can be selected, and can then be muted, kicked, or banned by vote.

=== ''"Large aircraft carrier" -- Mission Editor Description'' ===
The NFP Carrier is the main carrier of the enemy fleet. Unlike the [[Aircraft Carrier|allied aircraft carrier,]] the NFP Carrier is much larger, bearing a distinctive catamaran-like design with two hulls. It can hold up to 10 [[ASF-30]]s and/or [[ASF-33]]s on its deck for takeoff. It has four fighter catapults, two for each hull. It also has a straight-on runway located between the two hulls with an arrestor-bar-based landing system for allowing aircraft to land on the deck after being deployed. The NFP Carrier is also capable of supporting player spawns for the enemy faction in [[Multiplayer]], similarly to the allied carrier.

The NFP Carrier is most notable for its strong close-in defenses. Having one CIWS turret at each corner of the ship, the carrier has a very strong defense against incoming AGMs or cruise missiles. It also has two heat-seeking missile turrets at the rear corners for added defense against incoming hostile fighters. The NFP Carrier has a search radar located on top of its hull, functioning similarly to the radar found on the [[E-4 Overlord|AWACS]].

===''"Large missile cruiser equipped with a vertical launching system, large forward launch tubes, close air defense cannons" -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The NMSS cruiser is a hostile battleship designed with long-range air defense in mind. Its most notable features include a unique grid of long-range missile tubes on its forward deck and its two radars located on top of the ship. This ship is designed for long-range air superiority and taking heavy beatings before collapsing, making it an excellent ship to lead a fleet into battle with. The missiles stored in its forward launch tubes have a much longer booster phase than standard Surface-to-Air Missiles launched from a regular VLS or stationary [[SAM Launcher]], making them much more accurate and more difficult to evade than standard SAMs. This allows the NMSS cruiser an incredible amount of versatility in both offensive and defensive contexts. It can easily pin down airbases and carriers from afar, making it dangerous for them to scramble their fighters. To better facilitate its greater variety of functions, the NMSS Cruiser has two radars. One controls its forward launch tubes while the other handles its own VLS for mid-range air defense.

It is notable for its roles in the [[AV-42C]] and [[F/A-26B]]'s campaigns, [[The Island]] and [[Desert Cobra]]. In ''The Island,'' an NMSS Cruiser serves as the flagship of the enemy fleet sent to take over Akutan while the allied faction's main fleet was diverted. The player is tasked with using an [[AGM-89 Anti-ship Cruise Missile]] to destroy it in mission 6, ''Darkness.'' In ''Desert Cobra,'' two NMSS Cruisers are docked at the lake in mission 3, ''Strike At Naval Test Lake,'' and the player is tasked with performing SEAD operations while another squadron dispatches the docked ships, including dispatching the radars of the docked ships themselves.

The campaign for the [[F/A-26B]]. It contains eight missions that highlight the aircraft's multirole combat capabilities. You play as Kilo-1 and handle numerous combat roles during your duty. Roles include air-to-air combat, suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), and other air-to-surface objectives. The campaign brought a few new maps that are available for use in the [[Mission Editor]]. The height maps are provided in the EditorResource folder for use in the [[Map Editor]].

== Mission 1 - ''Base Defense'' ==
{{Quote|Defend the airbase supply depots from the incoming enemy attack.|Mission Description}}
Your objective is to defend the airbase from an incoming attack. Once you take off, immediately vector east to intercept some hostile strikers and other fighter squadrons. You can worry about the artillery convoy later on. It is also recommended that you defend the AWACS before it can be shot down; it will be very helpful in the next leg of the mission. Once the hostiles in the east are down, vector due north and intercept another squadron coming in. After that, head west as soon as possible to intercept another incoming fighter squadron and an incoming [[HB-106 Bomber]]. With those threats out of the way, you should get a notification of the convoy's position; fly to their location and destroy them as soon as possible. It should only take one [[CAGM-6 Cluster Missile]] or [[CBU-97 Bomb|CBU-97 Cluster Bomb]] to neutralize the platoon. Once the convoy is out of the way, you are free to land back at the airbase.
===Objectives===
* Defend airbase supply depots

===Threats===
*Various fighter squadrons
*HB-106 Supersonic Heavy Bomber
*[[GAV-25 BULLSHARK|GAV-25 Bullsharks]]

== Mission 2 - ''Retaliation'' ==
{{Quote|Turn the tables and attack the enemy airbase's supplies.|Mission Description}}
This mission has you launching covert strikes against the enemy airbases. Take off from the airbase and vector east towards the canyon river. Stay low to avoid their long-range radar defenses. There will be a squadron of fighters above your path; work with your wingmen to take them out, but don't let them divert you for too long. The first enemy airbase will be located at the east-southeast area of the map, near a town on a mesa. Fly through the canyon until you reach a bridge. From there, fly out of the canyon and order your wingmen to engage a SAM radar to your right. There will be a [[SAM S/A Radar (Enemy)|rotating SAM radar]] on top of the airport's control tower; an [[AGM-88]] can easily dispatch this target from afar. The supply tents will be located to the left of the airbase; fly in close and use your [[Cannons|cannon]] to destroy them. Order your wingmen to disengage and form up if needed and crest the hills to the northwest to escape the first airbase.

The second airbase is located in the north-northeast area of the map and lies within a valley flanked by jagged hills. Like before, fly low to avoid enemy fighter squadrons and SAM Sites and don't get hung up on groups of enemies along the way. The defenses at the second airbase are a bit stronger; aside from their SAM grid, there may be a squadron of hostile fighters above the airbase. Like before, use another AGM-88 to dispatch the S/A radar on top of the air control tower and order your wingmen to hit any other defensive measures in your way. Use your Vulcan again to destroy the supply tents and vector west to escape the airbase. You should now be cleared to RTB. Fly through the west side of the map to avoid any enemies and land back at the airbase once you reach it.
===Objectives===
* Destroy the 8 supply depots at each base (4 each).

===Threats===
*[[ASF-58]] squadrons
*[[SAM Launcher|SAM Sites]]
*[[Z20x2 Anti-Air Artillery|AAA guns]]

== Mission 3 - ''Strike on Naval Test Lake'' ==
{{Quote|Escort a strike group sent to destroy ships at the enemy's naval testing area.|Mission Description}}
This mission involves performing SEAD and CAP operations to protect a squadron assigned to destroy the fleet of ships moored at the lake. Take off and fly to the squadron above the airbase, X-ray 1, to begin the mission. It is recommended to equip at least one external fuel tank on your aircraft, as the initial escort objective is rather long. Fly with X-ray and avoid engagements until you crest a large mountain range. From there, order your wingmen to Engage and they will move to intercept the incoming fighters. Once your wingmen start their attack, rejoin X-ray and allow your wingmen to dispatch the hostile fighters. Order them to disengage and form up once those ASF-33s are gone so they don't get themselves killed at the lake. Now delete the GPS group for the escort path and follow X-ray into the AO.

You'll receive a notification once X-ray reaches their popup point--you will need to pop up as well once this happens. Fly up until you spot the hostiles on your [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)]]. Refer to the RWR's HUD overlay and target the radar signature at the far right of the HUD with your TGP. This will be one of the two SAM S/A Radars at the lakefront; these will be the biggest threats to you and X-ray. Use an [[AGM-161]] cruise missile to destroy this target. Use the TGP's GPS-S feature to mark them with a GPS waypoint and hit them with a 161. Once the missile is out, duck down behind the hills and vector to the east to dispatch the second S/A Radar at the enemy airbase. Once you reach the east end of the hills, turn left and use your TGP to mark the RWR blip farthest to the right on your HUD. Like before, mark it with GPS-S, make sure the new waypoint is selected, and use a 161 to destroy it from afar. Once this missile is out, immediately bank right and make for the hills to avoid any SAM sites that could be targeting you. The enemy fighters will now likely be a priority threat. Turn back around and switch your fighter's Radar on to search for the enemy fighters. You are looking for some ASF-58s over the lakeshore. Some of them may be coming for you if you're unlucky. Get up close to them and hit them with heat-seeking missiles, as they are resistant to radar locks. 

Once the fighters are out of the way, vector back to the hills to stage your next attack. Now you should focus on assisting X-ray with their attack. You can start by targeting some of the naval radars at the airbase harbor with AGM-88s or [[AGM-65]]s. Target the DMS Cruiser's radar (''DM'' on the RWR) and one of the NMSS Cruiser's radars (''LR'' or ''MC'' on the RWR) first. Open up your ARAD page, designate these targets, and fire your missiles. You should only need two missiles for this. Once your missiles are out, fly to the other harbor, the one with the first NMSS Cruiser. Fly behind it and prepare to destroy the NMSS's radars and the AAA turret to the right of the docks. AGM-65s are the most effective missiles to use here due to their range and optical fire-and-forget capabilities. At least 3 65s are required to do this. Once those targets have been destroyed, fly in and use your Vulcan cannon to dispatch the docked Gun Boats. Once those are gone, turn back around and fly to the airbase behind the main harbor. Now you will need to use some more 65s to destroy some of their air defenses. There should be an enemy [[Fire Control Radar]] to the far-right of the docks, next to the docked Gun Boats. You'll want to use at least 2 65s to do this: one for the FCR, and another for any ships still left standing. Once all the ships at the docks are destroyed (you can easily use some [[Hydra 70]]s for any stragglers), you will have to destroy two more cruisers patrolling the lake. Fly low and use whatever you've got left to destroy them. Once that's done, you'll be cleared to RTB. You'll need to fly around or destroy one more S/A radar in the mountains in between you and the airbase, though.
===Objectives===
* Support the strikers while they assault the docked ships.

===Threats===
*Docked ships still have completely functioning defenses
*Various SAM Site networks around each of the harbors
*An airbase that will scramble fighters and launch SAMs
==Mission 4 - ''Tanker Escort''==
{{Quote|Defend a tanker from airborne threats while it rendezvous with allied bombers.|Mission Description}}
This mission will be the first dedicated Combat Air Patrol mission of the campaign. You should only equip radar-guided and heat-seeking missiles for this operation. Take off and fly in the same direction as the tanker. A friendly AWACS will eventually spot a hostile squadron of ASF-33s coming in; intercept them as soon as possible. Another ASF-33 squadron will be spotted before you can destroy the first one, so you will need to be quick in dispatching the two squadrons. The tanker should rendezvous with the friendly bomber squadrons during this time. The next enemy squadron to be spotted will be a group of ASF-58s coming in from the north-northwest. You will need to use your afterburners to catch them before they can start attacking the tanker and the bombers. Another ASF-58 squadron will come in from the west once the first one is destroyed, so intercept them quickly. After the four squadrons have been neutralized and the bombers have refueled, you'll be cleared to RTB. You may be waiting a while for landing clearance, though!

===Objectives===
* Engage hostile aircraft before they can hit the tanker or the bombers.

=== Threats ===
* Multiple ASF-33 and ASF-58 squadrons.

== Mission 5 - ''Departure'' ==
{{Quote|Our naval strike group will be departing from port on the west coast. Hostile forces are trying to stop them.|Mission Description}}
This is one of the more difficult missions in the campaign. It involves your squadron being dispatched to deal with a hostile offensive while a carrier fleet heads out to begin a long-range mission. Your squadron will need to take off as soon as possible to reach the harbor before the carrier fleet can take any irreparable damage. Your first obstacle is a squadron of ASF-58s between you and the harbor. Like in mission 3, get up close to them and hit them with heat-seekers, as radar missiles are virtually useless against them at long range. Once they're gone, head south and intercept the incoming ASF-30s and the bombers heading for the carrier. Remember that the bombers are very fast, so you'll likely need to intercept them with your afterburners before they can start attacking the fleet. After that, vector further south and intercept a group of enemy GAV-25s before they can hit the fleet. Finally, you will have to deal with the hostile ground convoys heading to the harbor. They will be in tight parade formations, like the artillery group in ''Base Defense,'' so some CAGMs should be good for dispatching at least the bulk of them. The first group will be driving down a canyon road; fire a CAGM at their group and use your Vulcan cannon to dispatch any remaining vehicles there. The next convoy will be driving down the main road at the city just south of the harbor. Like before, use a CAGM and your Vulcan cannon to take them all out. Once the two convoys are gone, you will be cleared to [[Carrier Takeoff and Landing|land on the carrier]] and the mission will end once you do.

=== Objectives ===
* Destroy the hostile strikers and bombers threatening the fleet
* Destroy the ground convoys heading towards the base

=== Threats ===
* Numerous hostile CAP squadrons
** ASF-30s
** Some ASF-58s
* 3 HB-106s

== Mission 6 - ''Northern Assault'' ==
{{Quote|Participate in a strike against hostile military targets.|Mission Description}}
This mission is another dedicated CAP operation. Your carrier group has ventured into enemy territory and is preparing to make an assault against one of their forward bases. Your squadron is assigned to Combat Air Patrol duty and will protect the rest of your allies against hostile air threats. Take off from the carrier and fly to the first waypoint. Once you've reached the waypoint, the attack will begin. Immediately vector northwest to intercept the first enemy squadron and avoid the SAM Sites at the shore. Don't worry about the SAM radars on the shore; a friendly squadron will be handling SEAD operations for you. Destroy the first squadron and vector northeast, where an enemy carrier will be deploying its fighters to assist with their defense. Optionally, you can opt to bring some Hydra-70 rockets along with you to dispatch the carrier before its fighters can be scrambled. Once the carrier's fighters are neutralized, vector east once the allied strikers take care of the shoreline air defenses. You'll find another enemy squadron patrolling towards the northeast; intercept it and shoot it down. Once that's done, you'll be ordered to vector to the eastern airbase, where the final enemy squadrons are present. A bomber will take off from the airbase there, and you will have to destroy it before it can vector towards your carrier fleet. The airbase will be scrambling its fighters by then, so take them out quickly. Once the airbase's fighters are gone, your squadron will be cleared to return to the carrier, and the rest of the fighters will be cleared to RTB once the island is cleared out.

=== Objectives ===
* Destroy hostile air units around the island

=== Threats ===
* Enemy air patrols
* Small SAM grids

== Mission 7 - ''Striking Oil'' ==
{{Quote|The carrier group's next target is one of the enemy's main sources of oil.|Mission Description}}
This mission has your squadron destroying four oil rigs within a small archipelago. Take off and orbit the designated waypoint until command orders you to begin your attack. You and the rest of the squadrons will be heading around the northeast island while two allied cruisers go down the main way and begin a direct assault as a diversion. Once you reach the channel between the two small islands, the assault will commence. Fly up and target the oil rig farthest to the right with your TGP. It is recommended to bring either 8 AGM-65s or 4 [[Mk.83 Bomb|Mk. 83 Bombs]] with you to deal with the rigs. The former is the most efficient as it allows for better long-range target destruction; destroy two of an oil rig's legs to topple it, destroying the entire thing completely. Alternatively, if avoiding SAMs isn't an issue for you, you can opt to use a Mk. 83 against the rig; it's somewhat imprecise, but a well-placed Mk. 83 hitting an oil rig can destroy it completely with just one hit. Whatever method you choose, watch for hostile SAMs coming from the big island's shore or enemy ships in the water. Some hostile fighter squadrons will also take off from the enemy base later on, so fly back to the cruisers if you need cover. Your allies will be taking care of the rest of the enemies there, so you should be safe to make your assault on the oil rigs. Make sure to vector back around to the small island you passed earlier to terrain-mask any SAM site missiles or defend against enemy fighters (the cruisers will handle this for you).

Once all of the oil rigs have been totaled, fly to the next objective waypoint to receive new orders. Command will then inform you that "one of the highest-ranking enemy officers" is on the island and is about to make their escape. It's your job to intercept this VIP's convoy and destroy them before they can leave the archipelago. Fly back into the bay and approach the waypoint from the west to avoid the enemy's long-range air defenses. Use whatever weapons you have left to dispatch any air defenses in your way and find the convoy. Your TGP's HMCS view feature could be helpful here. The VIP's convoy will be composed of three vehicles in a line formation. Like with other convoys in the campaign, fire a CAGM at them from a reasonable distance to destroy the entire convoy with a single shot. Be careful to avoid the enemy's air defenses and lean on your wingmen to hold them off while you gun for the convoy. Once the VIP is eliminated, you'll be cleared to return to the carrier.

=== Objectives ===
* Destroy the 4 oil rigs in the bay
* Take out the VIP before they can escape

=== Threats ===
* Numerous ships in the bay
** DMS Cruisers
** A few NMSS Cruisers
** Many Gun Boats
* Hostile SAM Sites
* Enemy fighters

== Mission 8 - ''Decapitation'' ==
{{Quote|End the conflict for good by launching a heavy strike on the [enemy] command center.|Mission Description}}
The final mission in the campaign, and arguably the longest and hardest of them all. It involves a very strictly-coordinated attack with lots of air defenses to manage. This is also the only mission where you will be playing a role other than flight lead. Take off as soon as possible and form up (''not'' just 'rendezvous') with Kilo 1-1. Get in close and stay as close to the squadron as possible. Players with experience in [[Aerial Refueling|aerial refueling]] will likely have an easier time with this. If you break formation (get farther than ~500 meters from Kilo 1-1) four times, the mission will automatically fail. Get within ~100 meters of Kilo 1-1, use your afterburner and airbrakes to match their speed (~280&nbsp;m/s), and activate your aircraft's speed autopilot (SPD) to stay in formation with them. If you find yourself getting too far ahead or behind the squadron (especially after turns), deactivate your speed autopilot and quickly readjust to get back in formation. It may take some practice, but it shouldn't take too long to get a good technique down.

Kilo 1-1 will call out targets for you and your squadmates to deal with; follow their orders to the letter. You will need at least 2 AGM-65s for this. Your first target will be the Fire Control Radar at the far-right dock you will pass; lock the target with your TGP and destroy it before you pass over the area. Then your squadron will vector towards a city where they will have to destroy the air defenses there. Your target will be an IRAPC to the far-left edge of the city. Like before, hit it with an AGM-65 from afar before you pass over it. Your squadron will then vector through the mountain range towards the enemy command center. Once you reach the command center (Kilo 1-1 will say "Alright, fight's on!"), you are free to break formation and pick your targets. Your main targets will be their supply tents, but the air defenses present are very problematic, so you'll need to deal with them first. Deploy some AGM-88s against the two S/A Radars in the area and focus on destroying the AAA batteries in the area. After your first pass, command will transfer command of Kilo wing to you. Once the air defenses have been neutralized, work with your wingmen to destroy the rest of the supply tents.

After destroying all of the supply tents and eliminating the air defenses, a friendly [[AV-42C]] will vector in with a squadron to capture the rest of the enemy leaders. After the AV-42C lands, a tank platoon will emerge from the far-right hangar bay, so you will need to destroy it quickly. Like with clustered ground units before, a CAGM can easily take out the whole group in one shot. The AV-42C will take off again after a while, and you will need to escort it back to the carrier. The last threat present is a squadron of ASF-58s vectoring in from the southwest. Order your wingmen to engage the fighters and escort the AV-42C back to the carrier fleet. If any enemy fighters get close, break off and destroy them quickly before they can engage the transport. Once the three ASF-58s have been shot down, return to the transport and finish out its escort. Unlike with the first leg of the mission, you are not strictly required to 'stay in formation' with the AV-42C, but staying relatively close always works well for protecting it. Once the transport lands, you will be cleared to land as well, and the mission will end once you do. Time for a drink!

=== Objectives ===
* Form up with Kilo 1
* Hit hostile targets on the way to the AO
* Destroy the supply tents and air defenses at the command center
* Escort the AV-42C back to the carrier

=== Threats ===
* Hostile aircraft
* Hostile SAM Sites
* Numerous AAA batteries

{{Draft}}

Radar is the main method for detecting and targeting hostile aircraft in Beyond-Visual-Range (BVR) combat. Radar in VTOL VR works by sending out pulses and registering the reflections of those pulses as they return to the propagating source. In the context of VTOL VR, radar scanning is used to detect and target hostile aircraft in the sky.

== Radar Pros and Cons ==
Radar systems are very useful in VTOL VR for detecting hostile aircraft in the area.

=== Pros ===
* Radar can detect most aircraft from very long ranges. Radar detection range depends on the target's size and distance, along with the radar's Field of View (FoV). A tighter FoV will use more power to scan a more specific area as opposed to spreading the scanning power out, and will therefore be able to detect targets at a longer range at the cost of scanning width.

=== Cons ===
* Radar systems cannot be used to detect ground vehicles or aircraft that are grounded due to terrain interference. Because so many of the doppler waves get reflected back to an aircraft's radar source, the system has a hard time differentiating between what it sees. Radar systems are equipped with specific filtering algorithms to mitigate ground clutter and prevent it from returning confusing data to the targeting computers. As such, any targets that are grounded or very close to the terrain will likely evade radar detection completely unless they're moving very fast.
* The pulses emitted by hostile radars can be detected by units equipped with [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)|Radar Warning Receivers (RWRs).]] These systems can detect radar pings and trace them back to their sources, even identifying the type of radar that pinged it in the process. Anti-Radiation Missiles (ARMs) such as the [[AGM-88]] can even use Radar Warning Receivers for targeting radar sources from long ranges. Bear in mind that enemy units are not equipped with RWRs, so this only applies to Allied RWRs versus enemy radars.

== F/A-26B Radar Quick Guide ==

=== How to Use the F/A-26B Radar to Fire the AIM-120 Missile ===
# Turn on Radar switch to ON
# Set one of your MFDs to RADAR
## MFD Buttons R+ and R- adjust the range.  Use R+ to max until you see 60 and 30 mark green lines for max range
# Point your nose towards contact (diamond)
# Make your RADAR SOI, watch closely until red planes appear 
## Enemy aircraft are red icons
## Friendly aircraft are blue
## Missiles are circles
# Use the SOI controller (trackpad/joystick) to move the green brackets on target
# Press ONCE to identify target, [1] should appear on the left of MFD identifying it as target number 1.  Repeat for multiple targets and each one will be numbered.
# DOUBLE press to get a lock on the target (STT - Single Target Track)
# Select AIM-120 missile
# Missile range will be visible on the right side of the HUD as a vertical bar on the right hand side with a little pointer/arrow. 
## The bar represents the max range of the missile against the target continuously calculated as you and the target maneuver. When the arrow is within this range the missile may be fired and the yellow launch lights turn on.
## The double bar represents the no-escape range. If you fire when the arrow is there the enemy cannot escape the missile (but they can still defeat it with chaff and other methods)
# On the HUD, the enemy aircraft trajectory pointer (the small solid dot), doesn't have to be in the circle, but its desired as it represents an optimal path for missile trajectory
# The missile indicator on lower left HUD should show something like T-43s which is predicted time to impact. 
## The target does not need to stay STT locked all the time but it has to be WITHIN scanning range of radar until missile goes Pitbull (T changes to M), at which time the missile goes active and you can break the lock

=== Boresight Mode ===
Boresight mode is for working for < 15&nbsp;km and should be only used for close range.  When in boresight mode, the radar will lock on to the first aircraft to enter the circle in the HUD. Be sure not to accidentally lock a friendly fighter while in boresight mode.

== F-45A Radar Quick Guide ==
Unlike with the F/A-26B, the F-45A can more easily deploy radar-guided missiles through the use of its Tactical Situational Display MFCD page. Moreover, the F-45A uses AIM-120Ds instead of standard AIM-120s, which make use of the F-45A's expansive computer systems for more precise guidance. To deploy an AIM-120D with the F-45A...
# Open up the TSD on one of the areas on the touchscreen.
# Press the RADAR button on the left side of the TSD and press the Power button to turn it on.
# You will see a green cone appear in front of your aircraft's icon on the TSD; this represents the maximum range of your radar. This can be used to detect targets that are not already visible on the Radar Warning Receiver. Set the TSD as your Sensor of Interest and use the cursor to identify hostile air targets.
# Use the cursor to select your target once you've identified it. If they are close enough, the green cone will be replaced with a thick green line connecting your icon to the target, signifying a successful radar lock.
# Select your AIM-120s and squeeze the trigger to fire a missile. Deselect the target on your TSD after launching a missile to bring your radar cone back up so you don't accidentally lose lock before your missile goes active ("pitbull").
The F-45A does not have a Boresight-locking function for its onboard radar.

The RWR (Radar Warning Receiver) displays and identifies sources of [[Radar (Mechanic)|radar]] emissions. Initialisms identify the radar platform, while symbols help the user prioritize and respond to threats. The display updates a source every time a radar ping hits the aircraft. 

'''NOTE:''' ''No Allied radar sources are displayed on the RWR in singleplayer, except for that of the [[E-4 Overlord]].''

==Example Scenario (Surface to Air Threat)==

This is a brief example of what the RWR panel of a defending aircraft shows when a hostile [[SAM S/A Radar (Enemy)|SAM S/A Radar]] (DS) is detected, locks on and fires/guides a semi-active [[SAM Launcher|BSM-66]] to its target.

[[File:RWR SAM Launch Video.mp4|center|750px]] <!--File size can be adjusted using the px modifier. -->

== Symbology ==
{| class="article-table"
!Symbol
!Definition
|-
|[[File:RWR_Basic_Primary.png|thumb|left|45x45px]]
|The threat that the RWR has identified as the primary threat. This is dependent on several factors and may not always be your actual top priority; generally, airborne and long-range radars that are close to you are considered more dangerous.
|-
|[[File:RWR_Basic_Newest.png|thumb|left|45x45px]]
|
The marking for the most recently detected radar threat. This may also help with target prioritization. 
|-
|[[File:RWR_Basic_Airborn.png|thumb|left|45x45px]]
|The radar threat is airborne. Airborne threats vary significantly from ground threats, due to their ability to quickly reposition and fire from all angles.
|-
|[[File:RWR_Basic_Locked.png|thumb|left|45x45px]]
|The radar threat is '''locked on''' and '''tracking you'''. Listen for a radar spike (lock-on) warning tone. A lock-on doesn't always mean a missile launch, but be prepared for a missile launch warning.
|-
|[[File:RWR Basic Guiding (Revised).png|left|thumb|45x45px]]
|This is a '''very urgent''' marking. The radar threat has launched a semi-active radar missile, and is guiding it towards you. Take evasive maneuvers, and attempt to break lock or line of sight from the radar site. Incidentally, this is also what an enemy would see while your aircraft is guiding the [[AIM-7 SARH]] missile.
|-
|[[File:RWR_Missile.png|thumb|left|45x45px]]
|This is the '''most urgent''' marking. This tells you a missile has locked you with its own internal homing radar and is close to hitting your aircraft. Consequently, this is what an enemy would see when an [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] goes "pitbull", displaying an M on the HUD. 
|}
== Acronyms == <!--There are still a lot of RWR symbols associated with multiplayer that aren't listed here.-->

The '''Radial Menu''' (aka. the '''Hand Menu''') is a feature available to players in VTOL VR. The Radial Menu can be accessed within singleplayer or multiplayer and can The Radial Menu's functions vary between singleplayer and [[multiplayer]] gameplay. The features available through the Radial Menu are as follows, from top due clockwise:
* ''Recenter Seat:'' Recenters the pilot's forward direction to where their headset is pointing.
* ''Restart:'' Restarts the mission from the very beginning.*
* ''Exit Mission:'' Despawns the player and returns them to the menu (singleplayer) or lobby (multiplayer).
* ''Save/Load:'' Replaces the menu's controls with save and load buttons.*
** ''Load:'' Loads the mission from the last available quicksave point; restarts the mission otherwise.
** ''Save:'' Creates a quicksave of the mission's current state, which can be restored to via the ''Load'' function.

Access to the Radial Menu depends on the VR peripheral being used. Directions for different VR controllers are as follows:
*''HTC Vive controllers:'' Trigger + grip + menu button
*''Oculus controllers (Rift [S], Quest):'' Trigger + grip button + Y/B button
*''Valve Index controllers:'' Trigger + grip button + B button
*''Windows Mixed Reality controllers:'' Trigger + grip button + Y/B button

'''Rearm/Refuel Points''' are allied Units that can be used to create Forward Arming and Refueling Points, or FARPs, in a mission. They are added through the [[Mission Editor]] and can be used by both players and allied NPCs for rearming. They are designed specifically for use with Helipads (added through the Static Objects section in the Mission Editor); as such, it is recommended to use it for rearming [[AV-42C|AV-42Cs]] or [[F-45A|F-45As]] only, as they are the only allied aircraft with VTOL capabilities.
[[File:RearmRefuelPoints Variants.jpg.jpg|thumb|275x275px|The different Rearm/Refuel Point variants. From left to right: A, B, C, and D.]]
There are four different variants of Rearm/Refuel Points currently available:

* '''Rearm/Refuel Point A:''' ''"A designated area where the player can rearm or refuel."'' - This is the largest Point of the Rearm/Refuel Point family.
* '''Rearm/Refuel Point B:''' ''"A designated area where the player can rearm or refuel."'' - This Point is similar to Point A, but is smaller with fewer props nearby.
* '''Rearm/Refuel Point C:''' ''"A designated area where the player can rearm or refuel. (no props)"'' - Identical to Point B, except it has no adjacent props. Useful for additions of custom props.
* '''Rearm/Refuel Point D:''' ''"A smaller designated area where the player can rearm or refuel. (no props)"'' - Has no props like Point C, but is much smaller.

===''"A mobile rocket artillery truck. It can be commanded via event actions to [attack] specific locations or units. It will also automatically engage visible enemies between 2km and 8km when 'Engage Enemies' is checked." -- [[Mission Editor]] description''===
The Rocket Artillery Truck (RAT) is a ground unit available to both the allied and enemy factions. Each RAT contains a missile battery with 12 rocket launch tubes. The overall artillery function is very similar to the [[MPA-155]], except that it can engage enemies automatically when its 'Engage Enemies' property is checked. It also has a configurable reload speed, similarly to [[SAM Launcher]]s. The allied and enemy RATs are only different in their models used and function the same way otherwise. Artillery trucks will never move while performing fire missions.

Rocket Artillery Trucks fire in ''Salvos,'' and those salvos are based on two variables in their directives:
* ''Default'' ''Shots per Salvo ''- The amount of shots they make per salvo.
* ''Ripple Rate'' - Set the ripple rate to control how quickly the rockets are fired.  The value represents the number of rockets launched per minute.  For example, a ripple rate of 60 means 1 rocket every second, and a ripple rate of 120 means 2 rockets per second.
For their firing solutions, the Rocket Artillery Trucks can be given one of four firing orders:
* ''Fire on Waypoint - The RAT fires a salvo at a given waypoint.''
* ''Fire Salvos on Waypoint - The RAT fires a specific number of salvos at a given waypoint.''
* ''Fire Salvos on Waypoint Radius ''- The RAT fires a specific number of salvos at random points within a certain radius around the given waypoint.
* ''Fire on Unit'' - The RAT fires a salvo at a specific unit target.

Rocket Artillery Trucks have a maximum manual firing range of ~32 kilometers (17nm).

=== ''"A small unmanned boat carrying a large rocket launcher and a basic gun turret." -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The Rocket Boat is a variant of the enemy navy's [[Gun Boat]] with an unguided medium-range rocket launcher turret located in the back. It is designed with naval superiority tactics in mind. Though it is easily destroyed like its sibling, its added rocket launcher makes it a significant threat nonetheless, especially to other naval ships. Though not its main priority, the Rocket Boat is also capable of firing rockets at ground targets as well. The rockets seem to function similarly in application to the rockets launched by [[Rocket Artillery Truck]]s. The Rocket Boat is incapable of performing actual artillery fire missions, so the rockets are fired at enemies within a range of ~8&nbsp;km, similarly to the "Engage Enemies" functionality of the artillery truck.

The Rocket Boat is most widely-known for its role in mission 7 of [[The Island]], the vanilla campaign for the [[AV-42C Kestrel|AV-42C]]. After clearing out the airbase, a group of five of these Rocket Boats is spotted moving towards the carrier fleet. Left unchecked for long enough, they could easily down the whole fleet from afar within minutes.

== Armament ==
* 1x Double-Barrelled CIWS Turret; located at the bow of the ship.
* 1x Heavy unguided rocket launcher, 11 rockets loaded; located on a raised platform at the stern of the ship. Launches rockets at hostile ships from afar and can even down a distant [[Allied Cruiser]] with 1-2 good shots.{{Enemy Military Navbox}}[[Category:Ships]]

=== ''"Self propelled anti-air weapon. Armed with short-range radar guided missiles and twin anti-air cannons." -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The Self-propelled Anti-Air Weapon (SAAW) is a ground vehicle designed with short-range air defense in mind. It is essentially a superior version of the [[IRAPC]] with short-range radar-guided missiles instead of heat-seekers and a small cannon. It can load up to 8 missiles at a time and will engage enemies with its cannon at ~1&nbsp;km (0.5nm) and with its missiles at ~6km (3.2nm). The missiles on the SAAW are technically semi-active radar-guided SAMs; as such, they are incapable of [[Radar (Mechanic)|"going pitbull"]] on enemy air targets. It is identifiable on the [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)]] as ''SA.''

=== ''"Phased array fire control radar. Can rapidly detect and track targets in a 120 degree field of view. For use by SAM units that don't have their own radar." -- Mission Editor description'' ===
The SAM Fire Control Radar ([[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)|RWR]] designation: ''SR'') is one of two stationary fire-control radars used by the enemy faction, the other being the [[SAM S/A Radar]]. It can be connected up to [[SAM Launcher|SAM launchers]] to provide targeting and launch authorization for them.

== Distances and Usages ==
<!--[[File:SAM F-C Radar Vertical Arc.png|thumb|Photo showing the vertical scan arc of the radar.]]-->
It has a horizontal scan arc of ±60 degrees (120 degrees total) and a vertical scan arc of -9 to +81 degrees (90 degrees total). Unlike the SAM S/A Radar, it has a lower detection range, but also a much faster scan rate which is audible on the [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)|RWR]] as more pings per minute. This SAM dish is best suited for covering narrow or specific areas, like the area of [[Akutan]]'s airbase or a lake. It has a detection range of about {{Tooltip|35km|18 nautical miles.}}.

=== ''"Standard air defense platform capable of firing a variety of radar guided surface-to-air missiles. Requires [a] link to at least one [[Fire Control Radar]]." -- [[Mission Editor]] description'' ===
This is the enemy's Surface-to-Air Missile launcher (aka. SAM Site). It has 4 launch rails mounted on a turret. The unit can be configured in the mission editor to reload its stock after a specified delay (Default 120 seconds). Despite its description, the SAM Launcher can also be linked up to nearby [[SAM S/A Radar (Enemy)|SAM S/A Radars]] or even [[MAD-4 Radar|MAD-4 Radars]].

[[File:SAM Configs.jpg|thumb|249x249px|Each of the SAM Launcher's different configurations. From left to right: BSM-66, BSM-66LR (ASM-66LR), and FLKM-100.]]
The enemy faction's SAM Site has a few different kinds of Surface-to-Air Missiles it can equip in the Mission Editor, depending on the desired role.
* BSM-66 - ''"Standard semi-active radar-guided surface to air missile."'' The standard Surface-to-Air Missile. Attempts to intercept the target, dealing major damage on impact.
* BSM-66LR - ''"Standard semi-active radar-guided surface to air missile. Equipped with first-stage booster for extended range."'' A regular SAM with an extra booster stage, giving it much longer range and making it harder to outrun or outmaneuver.
* FLKM-100 - ''"Dual stage long range active radar-guided missile that deploys a field of explosive munitions."'' Essentially a BSM-66LR with active radar guidance that functions as an aerial cluster bomb. Intercepts the target and deploys a small field of cluster bomblets in front of them. The spread-out damage makes it excellent for dealing with bandits in close formation.
* ASM-66LR - ''"Active radar-guided surface to air missile. Equipped with a first-stage booster for extended range."'' Similar to the BSM-66LR, but with active radar tracking, allowing it to seek out and reacquire targets on its own after being launched.

=== ''"Long-distance detection and fire control radar. Can detect and track targets from any direction at great distances. For use by SAM units that don't have their own radar." -- [[Mission Editor]] description'' ===
The SAM S/A Radar ([[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)]] designation: ''DS'') is a stationary rotating fire control radar system. This unit uses a rotating dish radar to search for targets within the local airspace. It can be connected up to [[SAM Launcher|SAM launchers]] to provide targeting and launch authorization for them. The SAM S/A Radar can scan in a full 360 degree field of view and has a very long locking range, although that does mean slower updates in pings per minute. This type of SAM radar is generally best employed in wide open and elevated areas, such as on top of hills. It has a detection range of about 55km (25nmi).

'''Small Arms''' is a Quick Flight mission available for the [[AH-94]]. It involves the player destroying lightly-defended enemy outposts in the area using the AH-94's array of impressive air-to-ground weaponry in a Close Air Support (CAS) stance.

Like with the rest of the AH-94's Quick Play missions, this mission may also be played with other players in multiplayer. Two helicopters can be used in multiplayer, with each helicopter supporting their own pilot and gunner slots.

OBJECTIVES:
* Seek and destroy the Valley FOB
* Seek and destroy the Hillside FOB
* Seek out the final FOB
** Destroy the inactive [[SAM S/A Radar (Enemy)|SAM S/A radar]] present
* Return to base

== Walkthrough ==
=== Recommended Loadout ===
This mission serves as a basic showcase of the AH-94's Close Air Support capabilities. As such, hostile surface-based air defenses will be minimal, and hostile fighters will not be present. As such, you may forgo bringing air-to-air missiles completely, and you don't have to bring a radar with you. It is recommended to bring a '''GAU-94 cannon''' to deal with the softer and closer ground targets in the area. An ''M230'' may also suffice, but the higher rate of fire offered by the GAU-94 makes it easier to hit targets by quantity and chance instead of quality. For armored ground targets, quick-deployment weapons can suffice here. [[Hydra 70|Hydra 70s]], [[AGM-27|AGM-27s]], and [[AGM-114|AGM-114s]] are all decent weapons for dealing with targets like what will be found in this mission. Players could also use [[AGM-145|AGM-145s]] against armored targets on the ground, but since the air defenses are so weak in this mission and targets will be so close together, it would just be overkill.
=== Overview ===
You will start out on a helipad at an Allied airbase. Once you've completed the AH-94's startup procedure, take off and move towards the waypoint. Mission Control will inform you not to move too far to the southwest, as enemy forces will send fighters towards you if you venture too far into their territory. You should now activate your TADS and press the ''WPT'' button to slew the targeting reticle to the waypoint; this will allow you to spot enemy targets more quickly. Once you spot an enemy unit, the next part of the objective will begin, and you will be cleared to engage the enemy forces at the FOB. Your helicopter's cannon weapon (GAU-94 or M230) can easily make short work of the enemy units in the area, but it is recommended to use other air-to-ground weapons against the larger targets in the area to conserve ammo. A few barrages using some Hydra 70s or AGM-27s can easily make short work of the enemy's armored assets. Any remaining infantry units will be easily destroyed by some short bursts of fire from the helicopter's cannon weapon.

Once all the enemy units at the FOB have been destroyed, you will be assigned another waypoint to move towards. Head over a nearby mountain range to move towards the next waypoint. An enemy [[Infantry MANPADS|MANPADS]] infantry unit will be present at the next waypoint, so be ready to pop your flares if you get too close to the objective waypoint. Your main threat here is going to be a pair of [[GAV-25 Bullshark|GAV-25s]] attempting to take off once you're spotted. You will need to destroy the GAV-25s before they can take off. A couple well-timed shots from a PGM-27 can easily destroy those units quite quickly. From there, destroy the ground vehicles in front of the FOB and the infantry units occupying the compound. Once all the units at the second FOB have been eliminated, you will receive a new waypoint to move to.

Once you reach the next waypoint, you will be assigned to seek out the final enemy FOB. Look to the mountain at the far left of the waypoint to find a SAM grid under construction. You won't be able to destroy the bunker at the outpost, so you will be assigned to destroy only the enemy's inactive [[SAM S/A Radar (Enemy)|SAM radar]] before it can activate. An unfocused barrage of Hydra 70s fired at the enemy's FOB will generally be enough to destroy the radar and some of the other softer emplacements at the base. Once the SAM radar has been destroyed, you will be cleared to return to base.

=== Overview ===
In this mission, you are given 4 initial GPS waypoints that need to be observed to find 3 Weapon Supply Caches. The Cache locations are randomly generated somewhere in the vicinity of these waypoints every mission. These Caches look like large army tents (using [[Storage Tent A]] model) and from certain angles can look similar to aircraft hangars. However, the Cache will always generate an IFF Foe signature when you slew over it with your EOTS.

As the mission title suggests, the most likely route to success is staying as stealthy as possible. This does not mean remaining undetected the entire mission (this may be impossible), but it does mean taking all measures possible to not appear on radar until your first strike to take out at least one objective and any available threats.

=== Stealth Strategy ===
The goal is to remain undetected by enemy radar whilst getting into firing range. To prevent radar detection, you should:

* Keep the belly of the plane away from the direction of the radar source
* Avoid using afterburner
* Keep your own radar switched OFF
* Do NOT load any external hardpoints (E5-E10)
* Set all internal hardpoints to "manual uncage" mode. This means holding the joystick trigger opens the bay door, and the weapon-switcher button fires. Do NOT open the bay door until the very last second before you plan to fire.

The first bullet item above is most critical and requires that you stay very low to the ground and avoid hard banking. You should especially not roll away from a radar source (e.g. if a fighter is on the left side of your RWR, do not roll your plane to the right). Slow speeds and heavy use of the rudder allows for maneuvering while keeping the plane's underside parallel to the ground as much as possible.

Maintaining this approach, you can get very close to the SAM sites in the mission and remain undetected by the initial patrolling aircraft.  

One effective strategy is to sneak around the mountains to the northside of the airbase located at the same GPS location every mission. If you remain undetected up until getting close to the airbase, you can very quickly take out its one air defense missile turret and then mop up the scrambling fighters on the runway. At least one of the objectives is very often (always?) located at the airbase.

This will leave considerably less enemies in the air to engage with for when you seek out any remaining objectives.

Happy hunting!

The '''''[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141700/VTOL_VR_T55_Tyro__Trainer_Jet/ T-55 Tyro]''''' is a two-seater, single engine DLC trainer jet designed for [[Multiplayer|multiplayer]] flight instruction.

== Strategy ==
The T-55 Tyro can be used as a trainer plane, with a student pilot taking the forward seat and an instructor in the aft seat.

In a combat role, the T-55 can be useful as a strike aircraft. A pilot can fly while their WSO focuses targets on the ground or in the air.

Due to its few hardpoints, limited missile capacity, and low TWR, the T-55 is not well suited to dogfighting or prolonged air-to-air combat.

== Armament ==
''Main article: [[T-55 Hardpoints]]''

== Cockpit ==

=== Forward Pilot's Seat ===
The forward pilot's seat is similar in layout to the [[F/A-26B]], with some instruments rearranged and some controls being slightly smaller. 

Two new indicators are present in the cockpit: a Flight Control indicator and a two-button Master Arm switch.

* The Flight Control indicator (located right of the RWR) changes color depending on which pilot has control over the aircraft. Green means you have control while yellow means your co-pilot has control.
* The new Master Arm switch has two buttons: SAFE and ARM.
** The green light shows when on SAFE. 
** Red means weapons are armed and you currently have fire authority. 
** Yellow is the same except your co-pilot has fire authority. 
** Note that only one pilot is allowed fire authority at a time; you must press the ARM button to regain control over weapons.

=== Rear Pilot's Seat ===
This seat appears as "Instructor" in the multiplayer briefing room and has all of the same functionality of the forward pilot, with two additions.<!-- FURTHER ANALYSIS REQUIRED.

TODO: Test if the control knob also locks out the front pilot from having weapons control.

Spyglass 1 -->

* The Control knob (located above the landing gear) dictates how the pilots can control the aircraft.
** LOCK: Rear pilot has no flight controls; Grabbing the stick only grants control over their SOI. This is the default option when spawning in.
** NORM: The first pilot to grab the stick is given flight controls, similar to the AH-94.
** OVRD: Both pilots are allowed flight controls, but the rear pilot is given priority.
* The MFD Mirror switch (located to the left of the RWR) allows the aft pilot to view the MFDs of the forward pilot. Once the mirror switch is turned off, the aft MFDs will remain on the same page.

=== Singleplayer vs. Multiplayer ===
The Control Knob and MFD Mirror switch are absent in Singleplayer. Instead, there is a "Switch Seat" button on the right panel near the brake lock. Pressing this button allows the player to change seats in flight.

<!-- The writing within this comment came from a previous draft of the article. While the writing itself is unfit for the Wiki, it's being retained internally to act as a reference for a new draft.

This new trainer aircraft will have a multitude of differences to the other aircraft already in VTOL; one of these features being the double-seater layout. We have only seen this in the '''[[AH-94]]''', where the front seat is the gunner of the aircraft and the back seat is the dedicated pilot. However, within this new trainer, the front seat will most likely be the trainee and the back seat will be the trainer. This new layout comes with a few main differences to other aircraft.
The '''''T-55 Tyro''''' will have a new "MFD Mirroring" system, mentioned in the [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141700/VTOL_VR_T55_Tyro__Trainer_Jet/ '''official Steam page for this DLC''']. This feature will allow the player in the backseat of the aircraft, or the instructor, to view or take control of the student's MFD (Multifunction Display). It will also have the option for the trainer to take control of the student's flight controls.
[[File:Screenshot (1730).png|right|frameless|267x267px]]
The weapon system for the '''''T-55 Tyro''''' will also have some differences from what we're used to. Within the promo video posted on VTOL VR's official steam page, we can see the '''''T-55''''' shooting down another aircraft with what its [https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Cannons Vulcan Machine Gun]. However, what's different from other aircraft is that the aiming instrument for the trainer's MG is what's called the "Funnel", or more specifically an EEGS system. This stands for Enhanced Envelop Gun Sight. This instrument shows the path that your rounds will take if fired, and assists pilots in aiming. This instrument is solely used for air-to-air purposes, and not air-to-ground.-->== Trivia ==

* The T-55 Tyro was announced on March 14th, 2023 and was released 10 days later on March 24th, alongside the 1.6.0 Update.
* "Tyro" comes from the Latin "''tiro"'', meaning a young soldier or a novice.{{Playable Aircraft Navbox}}

{{Stub}}The '''tanks''' are the main ground-based battle vehicles for the allied and enemy factions. The premiere choice for ground combat. They engage hostile ground vehicles with their main cannons, and infantry and aircraft with their machine guns at close range. The game features two tanks; an Allied M1 tank, and an enemy MBT2-E tank. 

Their cannons have an engagement range of ~2km (1nm), and their machine guns ~1km (0.53nm).

'''The Island''' is the default campaign for the [[AV-42C]], and VTOL VR's first official campaign. It contains 7 missions taking place on [[Akutan]], showcasing the AV-42C's various tactical and logistical capabilities.

== Mission 1 - ''Preparation'' ==

=== ''"Help make preparations to defend the island. Transport personnel to the coastal SAM Site." -- Mission description'' ===
This is the first mission in the campaign. The first half of it involves the player loading up some troops and delivering them to a waypoint. Open your doors, let the troops in, land at the waypoint, and let the troops back out. The second half of the mission has you rescuing the crew of a crashed AV-42C from a remote island. Meet up with a fighter squadron in the sky; they will escort you to the waypoint. A squadron of hostile [[Manta UCAV|drone fighters]] will be above the island, but your fighter escort will take care of them for you. From there, land at the waypoint, pick up the infantry units, and deliver them to the hospital via the helipad in the southern city. Once the second group has been dropped off, you may return to base.

=== Objectives ===
* Deliver troops to the SAM site area in the city
* Extract the crew from the island

=== Threats ===
* None

== Mission 2 - ''Minesweeper'' ==

=== ''"Destroy the drone ships laying mines on supply routes." -- Mission description'' ===
The first combat mission in the campaign. Take off, meet up with a fighter squadron, and engage the enemy ships south of Akutan. The fleet is composed of several Mine Boats following a hostile [[Drone Carrier]]. The Drone Carrier will deploy its drone fighters promptly after arriving at the AO; focus on the mine boats and allow the fighters to keep their cruiser escort and drones busy. If the Drone Carrier locks onto you with its SAM radar, dive down towards the sea, away from the cruiser, and deploy chaff to avoid its missiles. It is generally easiest to deploy your GAU-8 against the mine boats, as they are very fragile. Once the mine boats are out of the way, you can return to base. Optionally, you can help the friendlies deal with the enemy cruiser before you head home. This can be done easily with a few [[Hydra 70]] rockets aimed at their bridge.

=== Objectives ===
* Destroy the [[Mine Boat|Mine Boats]] and their escort

=== Threats ===
* A Drone Carrier escorting several mine boats.

== Mission 3 - ''Redirection'' ==

=== ''"Join the carrier fleet embarking on a preemptive naval strike." -- Mission description'' ===
Another no-combat mission. The first leg of it has you flying into the sky to find a fighter that went missing and escort it to a [[KC-49 Tanker|refueling tanker]]. The fighter will be flying a wide orbit around the designated waypoint; using the TGP's HMCS View feature can be very helpful here. After the fighter refuels, you can both land at the carrier.

=== Objectives ===
* Find the missing pilot in the sky
* Escort the pilot to the tanker
* Land at the carrier

=== Threats ===
* None

== Mission 4 - ''Open Water'' ==

=== ''"Meet the enemy in open water for a preemptive strike." -- Mission description'' ===
The first large-scale combat mission in the campaign. The first part of the mission has you dealing with some drone fighters harassing your carrier fleet. You then vector to the next waypoint, where you will encounter and engage the enemy fleet. Just like in ''Minesweeper,'' Hydra 70s are very helpful for dealing with DMS Cruisers and Drone Carriers. When dealing with ships equipped with SAM turrets or VLSes (visible on the [[Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)]]), approach them at an angle to make missile evasion easier if they lock onto you. Most importantly, the enemy fleet has a strong close-in defense of double-barreled CIWS turrets; if you get too close, the CIWS turrets will start firing at you. To avoid CIWS fire, quickly pitch up, pitch back down, and repeat until you're out of range. The closer you are to the turrets, the less effective this maneuver will be. Once the enemy fleet is gone, land back at the carrier to complete the mission.

=== Objectives ===
* Destroy the enemy fleet

=== Threats ===
* Multiple [[Gun Boat|Gun Boats]]
* Multiple DMS Cruisers
* At least one [[Drone carrier]]

== Mission 5 - ''Silent Island'' ==

=== ''"Return to the island to investigate why communications have gone silent." -- Mission description'' ===
The first leg of this mission has you escorting a fighter squadron to a nearby fuel tanker. If your RWR is on, you will spot multiple signals coming from the northern coast of the island; an enemy fleet is present there. Once the fighters have refueled, fly to the next waypoint to receive your next objective. Make sure to stay low to avoid getting locked by the enemy fleet. You will then receive an objective to destroy a convoy en route to a group of engineers still on the island. Hit their air defenses first to debilitate the convoy; [[AGM-65]] missiles are recommended for effectiveness and safety. Once the entire convoy is gone, land at the next waypoint and allow the engineers to load onto your ship. After they've loaded up, take off and return to the carrier.

=== Objectives ===
* Find out the situation on Akutan
* Destroy the convoy threatening the engineers still on the island.
* Pick up the engineers and return to the carrier.

=== Threats ===
* A whole enemy fleet in the bay area
* A hostile convoy
** Tanks
** Air defenses

== Mission 6 - ''Darkness'' ==

=== ''"Begin a counterattack under the cover of darkness." -- Mission description'' ===
An [[AGM-89 Anti-ship Cruise Missile]] is required to complete the mission. Take off from the carrier and head to the island. There will be multiple hostile air patrols above the island, but the other fighters will take care of those squadrons for you. Get high up enough to identify the radar signals coming from the bay, but stay far away enough to avoid getting locked onto. Remember to stay away from enemy fighters and SAM sites around the island. Your target should be easy to identify: on your RWR, you will see at least one radar signal named ''"LR"'' or ''"MC";'' that's your target. Also, if you have the HUD overlay enabled, you should be able to see what looks like a discolored green diamond among the other diamonds in the bay; that would be the calling card of the enemy's [[NMSS Cruiser]]. The NMSS Cruiser fires special missiles from its forward launch tubes. Unlike the regular SAMs encountered in previous missions, these are active-guided long-range SAMs. These rely on the deploying vehicle for homing, but activate their own internal radar systems to track their targets once they get close enough. If you find your aircraft locked onto by an ''LR'' radar, it will be important to terrain mask that radar as quickly as possible, as their missiles are much harder to defeat up-close. That being said, considering how far out in the bay the NMSS Cruiser is, attacking it by conventional tactics will be a suicide mission.

Once you've identified the target, use your TGP's GPS-S function to set a nav marker on the target's location. Then enable the Path feature on your GPS MFCD page and use your NAV page's GPS-S feature to set up a path to your target. It is recommended to set up a path of 2-3 points going around the island and hit the NMSS from the side. Once your points are in place, go back to your GPS tab and move the first waypoint (the one where the target is) down to the bottom of the list with the double-arrow buttons. If you've done everything right, you should see a series of points on the NAV map moving around the island, connected by lines, leading straight to the enemy target.

Next, move to the EQUIP tab on another MFCD and check your AGM-89's settings. Make sure your missile's Terminal setting is set to either SSEvasive or Popup. The former makes the missile less likely to get shot down, but the latter makes it more likely to sink the target. Choose wisely. Once your missile is set up, make sure the first point on your path is selected (use the single-arrow buttons on your GPS MFCD page), point towards it, select the AGM-89, point towards the highlighted GPS marker on your HUD, and fire away. 

If everything goes well, your missile should vector around the island, avoid hostile CIWS, and impact the enemy NMSS Cruiser, sinking it in one hit. Once this is done, you are cleared to return to the carrier.

=== Objectives ===
* Destroy the enemy's NMSS Cruiser.

=== Threats ===
* NMSS Cruiser
* Occasional SAM Sites

== Mission 7 - ''Island Defense'' ==

=== ''"Begin to take back the island and eliminate the enemy fleet off the northern coast." -- Mission description'' ===
The final mission of the campaign. Take off and assault the airbase. At the front of the base will be a hostile [[Fire Control Radar]] flanked by hostile [[Z20x2 Anti-Air Artillery|Anti-Air cannons]]; target them with your TGP, fly behind the airbase, and use some AGM-65s to safely dispatch them before continuing your attack. Use your flares to counter the enemy heat-seeking missile defenses (a [[Infantry MANPADS|MANPADS]] and an [[IRAPC]]) and keep making passes around the back of the airbase to clear it out. Some well-placed Hydra 70s can easily destroy clusters of hostiles; alternatively, you could opt to hit them with [[Mk. 82 Bomb|Mk. 82s]] in quick bombing runs. Once the airbase is cleared, you will receive an objective to destroy an incoming platoon of [[Rocket Boat|Rocket Boats.]] The objective may also begin if you're taking too long to clear out the airbase. Fly in close and use your GAU-8 to destroy the boats. Remember that you can also target enemy boats with your TGP and command your wingmen to engage them for you, or use some AGM-114s against separate targets. Once the boats are gone, return to the carrier, rearm and refuel if needed, and fly up to the next waypoint.

Your next objective has you assaulting a SAM Site in the eastern city. Hit its FCR or SAM Launchers to clear the incoming friendly fleet for takeoff. Once that's out of the way, vector to the bay to make your combined assault. Try not to fly too close to the enemy fleet, as they have numerous DMS Cruisers and Drone Carriers in the area. AGM-65s are immensely helpful for dealing with those kinds of ships from afar. Focus on their radars at first and let your allies handle the remaining enemies. During your anti-ship objective, you will receive another objective to deal with another incoming carrier and its four cruiser escorts. Once the first anti-ship objective is out of the way, land at the nearest allied carrier and rearm for the final leg of the mission.

This part is generally the hardest one for many players, as the carrier fleet is very difficult to destroy. AGM-65s tend to get shot down, and it's difficult to hit them with AGM-89s, so you'll need to get creative to defeat this fleet. If you manage to destroy the radars of the cruisers escorting the carrier, as well as the two IR SAM launchers on the carrier's stern, a pair of allied bombers will vector in to dispatch the carrier for you. Alternatively, you can simply land at the carrier and wait for its escorts to intercept the carrier fleet. The cruisers have very powerful anti-ship weaponry and can easily deal with the carrier fleet for you. Once the carrier fleet is out of the way, land at the Akutan airbase to complete the mission.

=== Objectives ===
* Destroy the enemies at the airbase
* Destroy the hostile Rocket Boats heading towards your fleet
* Destroy the enemy fleet at the northern coast
** Main ships
** Carrier and its escorts

=== Threats ===
* SAM Sites on Akutan
* A platoon of Rocket Boats
* The enemy fleet
** Numerous Gun Boats
** Numerous DMS Cruisers
** Several Drone Carriers
** A carrier group

*** Four DMS Cruisers

This page is dedicated to the aggregation of various miscellaneous tips and tricks for survivability and tactical superiority in the context of VTOL VR. 

== Radar Missile Evasion ==
Radars work by sending out pulses of radio waves and detecting if the radio waves reflect back to the radar source.

'''Terms'''
* Soft lock: When a radar is tracking a target, such as through Track-While-Scan (TWS) functionality.
* Hard lock: When a radar locks directly onto a target, such that the target's RWR would pick up the lock and warn the pilot.
* Notching: Positioning your aircraft between a radar source and terrain while flying perpendicular to the radar source, causing it to filter you out and lose lock.
* Spike: When a hostile aircraft's radar locks onto your own aircraft.
* Mudspike: When a hostile ground radar locks onto your aircraft.
* Booster Stage/Phase: The initial stage of a rocket or missile's activation where the rocket booster is propelling the missile forward. Missiles will continue to glide with their fins after their booster stages complete. 
* Smoke trail: The trail of smoke a missile leaves behind during its booster phase. Can be used to visually spot an incoming missile.
* Chaff: A tightly packed bundle of metallic threads that can act as a countermeasure against radar locks.
* Vertical Launch System (VLS): A tube cell system on most naval ships that can launch Surface-to-Air Missiles at hostile air targets and Surface-to-Surface Missiles at hostile naval targets.
* Pitbull: When an active radar-guided missile gets close enough to its target and switches to its internal radar projector for guidance, establishing a lock on the target and no longer relying on datalink updates from the firing aircraft.
* RCS: In the context of radar mechanics, an acronym for ''Radar Cross-Section.'' RCS refers to how much surface area of an aircraft is facing towards a radar source, affecting the likelihood of the radar waves reflecting straight back to the propagating source and triggering a definite detection. This makes it easier to avoid radar detection by flying straight towards a radar source; this may seem counterintuitive at first, but it exposes the lowest amount of surface area to the radar source, decreasing one's relative RCS. Additionally, aircraft with smoother and smaller frames, such as the [[F-45A]], will naturally have an easier time controlling their relative RCS due to their smaller size, smoother frame, and other small factors such as radar-absorbent coating and ordnance strategization.

=== Techniques ===
* If you've launched a missile at an enemy, and suspect a missile launch (e.g. you see a smoke trail), force it to waste its energy. Make a broad to the left or right to make the missile turn, causing it to waste kinetic energy by maneuvering and ultimately slow down. A slower missile is less effective at reaching your aircraft. This technique is called '''Cranking''', and you should begin this immediately after launching one of your own missiles.
*You can also opt to hold your heading to the 3 or 9 o'clock of the missile and use your afterburners to force the missile to keep turning in one direction; this technique is called '''Beaming.''' This should be done if you have not launched a missile yourself.
* Outmaneuver their missiles. When the missile comes close, roll left or right and pull back on the flight stick as hard as you can. Pulling G may allow you to evade the missile kinematically. This is best done when the missile is low on energy, especially if it's past its booster stage (it no longer generates a smoke trail).
* Use your chaff. When employed adequately, it can confuse radars to break a lock or make other maneuvers easier later on. Chaff should be used when notching a missile or radar to create a cluttered background. (See the section on Countermeasures below for more info.)
*[[AIRS-T]] missiles are capable of locking onto and intercepting incoming radar guided or IR missiles. This technique is nicknamed '''Active Defense.''' Using the AIRS-Ts in Track Mode is also helpful in this application. Bear in mind that this is a somewhat inefficient use for the AIRS-Ts, so it should only be employed in emergencies.

=== Specific Sources ===
There are also more specific tips available for dealing with radar-guided missiles coming from different sources as well.

==== ''Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs)'' ====
This refers to radar-guided missiles launched from hostile aircraft. As a reference, air-launched RGMs will usually come at you from above and tend to be faster due to not having to fight against gravity or deal with drag as much.
* Against radar sources locking you from above, there's a maneuver you can employ that can allow you to "slip out" of a hard lock, even against missiles that are still well within their booster phases. This technique is called '''Notching.''' To do this, identify the source of the hard lock on your RWR and turn so that the radar cone is facing you at your 3 or 9 o'clock angle. If you are below the radar, then the hostile radar will confuse you with the terrain and filter you out, breaking lock instantly. This technique can even be used to break lock against multiple hostile radar sources in short order if they are within a similar angle relative to your aircraft. This technique tends to pair well with Beaming.

==== ''Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs)'' ====
This refers to missiles launched by hostile [[SAM Launcher]]s or the Vertical Launch Systems of hostile naval ships, such as the [[Drone Carrier]]. 
* When you get mudspiked, dive down low immediately. This segues into three different evasion techniques:
** The simplest way to deal with incoming SAMs is to put some terrain between you and the incoming radar source. Blocking a radar's line of sight is an easy way to get out of a lock. This technique is called '''Terrain Masking.''' This works against any radar source, including the missiles themselves (after going pitbull).
** While diving down, the missile will actively dive down as well to try to meet up with you at the calculated intercept point. This can be actively exploited to cause the missile to collide with the ground. The technique itself is referred to as '''Driving.''' While diving down, activate your afterburner to descend as quickly as possible. If done correctly, the missile's trajectory will place it on a crash course straight with the ground. Make sure to pull up in time to keep yourself from crashing as well!
** Missiles tend to have a harder time propelling themselves forward when at low altitudes, as the air density creates considerable drag for them to fight. This can be exploited to decrease an engine's propulsion efficiency with a technique called '''Dragging.''' In short, the closer to sea level a missile is, the less energy it can gain. This makes it slower and allows other maneuvers to be more successful.

== Countermeasures ==
Knowing how to use your countermeasures effectively is key to defeating missiles. Each playable fighter will have two different types of countermeasures at its disposal: '''Chaff''' and '''Flares.'''

* '''Chaff''' comes in the form of small canisters packed with metal threads that disperse behind an aircraft on deployment. The main purpose of chaff is to confuse hostile radars; if employed correctly, it can be used to reduce the accuracy of incoming radar-guided missiles or even break their lock on you entirely. Chaff is most effective when the defending aircraft is flying perpendicular to (at a 90 degree angle relative to) a hostile locking radar. It is a very useful tool when ''notching'' a hostile radar (see above) as it can further clutter the background behind a fighter, making it easier to confuse radars into losing their lock on your fighter. Furthermore, in lieu of a terrain background (when a radar source is locking you from below your aircraft), you can make liberal use of chaff to create an impromptu backdrop in the sky itself, which can also help notch your aircraft out of a radar lock. Be aware that chaff is of little use outside of the context of notching, and should be deployed only very sparingly outside of such contexts.
* '''Flares''' are the most widely recognized countermeasure and are used specifically for fooling Fox-2 [heat-seeking] missiles into losing lock on your aircraft, for they are incredibly hot, and burn at over 2000° Farenheit. If a hostile aircraft fires a Fox-2 at your own, then you should turn away from the incoming missile(s); cut your throttle to reduce your heat signature, '''if you are flying with your afterburners, cut them immediately'''; and deploy a burst of flares before the missile gets too close. As long as you maintain a degree of situational awareness in the sky, heat-seeking missiles are generally easy to beat. ''Flares have no effect against radar-guided missiles and should be disarmed when heat-seeking missiles are not an immediate threat in the area.''

Each countermeasure can be armed and disarmed via controls in your cockpit. Know what sorts of threats you will be going up against and don't deploy both types of countermeasures at the same time to conserve them.

The CMS page of the MFCD allows the pilot to set the deployment speed and method of countermeasures. It alleviates workload on a pilot, allowing them to simply hold the CMS button of the throttle to automatically deploy chaff and flares at set intervals. 

== Weapon Deployment ==
'''Lofting'''
Lofting is a technique used to increase a missile's overall effective range. This is especially useful in BVR combat (with [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120s]]), where range is important. In order to loft a missile...
# '''Fly with afterburner. Exceed Mach 1 if possible.''' Higher speed gives your missile more energy, giving it a higher maximum speed before the motor burns out.
# '''Angle your aircraft's nose up to ~10 degrees.''' AIM-120s follow a ballistic trajectory when launched, but turning immediately after launch wastes energy. Pitching up before launching the missile maximizes its energy state by reducing the turn required.

This can also be helpful where AGMs are concerned, especially when working with Anti-Radiation Missiles.

==Game Overview==
[[File:VTOLVR Logo.jpg|thumb|395x395px]][http://store.steampowered.com/app/667970/VTOL_VR/ VTOL VR] is a near-future VR mil-fantasy flight game developed by Paolo Encarnación, also known as ''[[BahamutoD]]'', of [[Boundless Dynamics]], original creator of the ''BDArmory'' mod for ''Kerbal Space Program.'' It is centered around air combat, putting players in one of three aircraft in a military environment. Players can interact with each button and switch in their cockpit to control their aircraft; no keyboard or even HOTAS interaction is required. Players can take on a number of different enemies, including hostile aircraft, ground units, and even naval ships with a plethora of strong weaponry. VTOL VR was released on Steam Early Access on August 7, 2017 and entered 1.0 on August 7, 2020.<br>
VTOL VR is currently in version '''{{Game Version}}'''.

VTOL VR is playable on the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift (S), Valve Index, Oculus Quest (only via Oculus Link or Virtual Desktop) and Windows Mixed Reality. The game requires both an HMD and controllers. There is optional hardware rudder support, but no HOTAS support.  

VTOL VR offers a small variety of advanced multi-role aircraft for use: 

*[[AV-42C]], a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capable vehicle.
*[[F/A-26B]], a carrier based air-superiority fighter that can be configured for ground attack roles.
*[[F-45A]], a small stealth aircraft with VTOL capabilities and an internal weapons bay.
*[[AH-94]], an attack helicopter apt for carrying out close air support tasks. (DLC)

The game offers [http://vtol-vr.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Missions missions] that put players in transport, air-to-ground, and air-to-air combat roles. Additionally, users can create their own [[Map Editor|maps]] and [[Mission Editor|missions]] or play other users' content via the Steam Workshop.

Aside from the COMMS page in an aircraft's [[MFCD]] system, it is possible to use '''voice commands''' instead to quickly talk to wingmen, AWACS, and ATC.

[[File:Watchman Truck Profile.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''Watchman Truck''' is a mobile air defense radar unit available to the Allied faction. When ''Engage Enemies'' is enabled, the Watchman Truck will park and activate its radar, allowing it to coordinate the firing of associated SAM launchers. The Watchman Truck is commonly seen alongside the [[SLAM Truck]], another mobile air defense unit.

== Trivia ==
* The Watchman Truck uses the chassis model from the [[SRAD]] with a [[SAM S/A Radar]] dish at its rear.

<!--This article refers to the callouts used by and for AI wingmen in singleplayer. Do not add real-world callouts that are not traditionally used in VTOL VR to this article.-->
When deploying weapons, each one has a specific callout that is traditionally [[Voice Commands|announced]] to their wingmates to communicate their current actions and mitigate the risk of other friendly munitions being wasted on a target that will likely already be destroyed. All of the callouts used in VTOL VR are listed here.

== Relevant Callouts ==
* "Guns, guns, guns!" - Firing a [[Cannons|cannon]] weapon
* "Fox 1!" - Firing a semi-active radar-guided missile ([[AIM-7 SARH]])
* "Fox 2!" - Firing a heat-seeking AAM ([[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], [[AIRS-T]], etc.)
* "Fox 3!" - Firing an active radar-guided missile ([[AIM-120 AMRAAM]])
* "Rifle!" - Firing an Air-to-Ground Missile ([[AGM-65]], [[AGM-114]], etc.)
* "Pickle!" - Dropping a bomb ([[Mk. 82 Bomb]], [[GBU-38 Bomb]], etc.)
* "Magnum!" - Firing an Anti-Radiation Missile ([[AGM-88]], [[AGM-126 SideARM II]], [[AGM-188 MARM]])
* "Bruiser!" - Firing an [[AGM-89 Anti-ship Cruise Missile]]
* "Greyhound!" - Firing an [[AGM-161]]

=== ''"Anti-Air Artillery. Dual 20mm rotary cannons" - Mission Editor description'' ===
Two Gatling guns mounted on a turret, similar to the [[C-RAM Truck]] or CIWS on ships. Aside from targeting hostile fighters, it will also target incoming missiles or even bombs, making it a good defensive measure against hostile strikers.

Tracks the player once in range and fires a burst of rounds. Can often be tricked by deploying chaff and/or swerving the aircraft perpendicular to the radar source. These units will turn off their radar when they are out of ammo.

It has a range of {{Tooltip|~2.5km|~1.3nm}}.
