I don't remember a mission like that, but with the AV you have to land in a field once and with the 45 you have to land at a small FOB
In multiplayer the host model breaks and gets set to the tacview default
Also iv been having issues where the shown heading, and the real heading are different
I def didnt land with a 10 degree offset 😄
Yeah lol 30 aircraft is doable
We don't know
@Freedomplaza you were planning some MP missions right
Single life/limited life settings so people can’t infinitely respawn would be great
Speaking of scores, a way to see the current score would be nice, currently you have no idea what the score is due to people leaving/joining
Yes this as well
:thonkery:
Wut
You can already see the leaderboard in aircraft , but that dosnt display score due to ppl leaving
Right yeah budget, money rewards for objectives would be excellent
Oh
Nice
Money being pooled with the team vs per player as an option would be nice
That’s already a thing in mp
Yeah
When you start a lobby you get the option to enable/disable hud icons
It’s not in the editor, it’s based off the lobby itself
Not yet
Where would the picked up people go?
Yeah
but
where would the people go?
Like on the aircraft
they'd have to sit outside on the wings
Issue is to employ weapons you still need the TADS (or I guess you can use GPS weapons)
There's an action when the user does something in the cockpit right? Iirc thats how the tutorial works
Would'nt be suprised if it uses the custom format baha made
Yeah it is
So you'd have to write a custom parser for it, but its a simple structure so
Im fairly confident, iv used quite a few formats and never seen this, and looking at the game code I *think* its fully custom
Ok yeah it is custom
Baha is using something he calls a "ConfigNode"
Its the same thing quick saves use iirc
im writing a vts2json just for the fun of it
No and no, but you can decompile the code and take a peak
Not at all
Its quite readable
All method names retain their original names, and the decompiler is quite good about guessing names to things
Unity/C#/mono
yes
thats it
Baha made BDArmory so
https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/class_config_node.html Yeah pretty sure its built into KSP
But the config node class thats in vtol seems to be not as an external project
Seems like it?
@BahamutoD Any info about the VTS file format/how we could possible parse it and work with it?
Repeating is something thats been asked for a lot recently, but suggestions are normally best in #vtolvrdev
:oknice:
nan
context here and above
it is on the right
But, now I can translate VTS to JSON
I just gotta write a JSON to VTS translator now
No im still working on the compiler
I am having fun with encapsulation tho
not yet
uh
What aircraft is this mission for?
Sure
what aircraft?
A 26 could p easily hit all of those targets youll want wayyyyy more
If anyone is planning on messing around with scenario files directly, I wrote a small program to convert VTS into JSON, and JSON into VTS https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTOLConfigNodeToJSON
I may have missed some data format/type that VTOL uses so uh just yell at me if it dosnt work
:Think:
the program is litterly hard coded to use `input.json` and `input.vts` why tf would I make UI
I didn't even bother to add a command line argument for input
If anyone is going to be using this, they know at least enough to make changes to the code as they need
@Steakfest if your interested
yes
input.vts -> output.json input.json -> output.vts
Wrong accnt
:risitas:
don't worry about it
Oh wait I just remmebered there was a bug that I didn't fix
:defaultdance:
the vts file format is :Agony:
wait fuck
~~im going to have to do something crused~~ nvm im dumb
Vtol has two different types of empty values
Iirc they can be granted for completing objectives
500m is accurate to what their vision radius is so that makes sense
Maybe?
Living life as a manpad opperator must suck
they get modified eyes that let them see 4.5km
except they loose the ability to see anything except things in the sky
They are nearly completly blind
They sit in darkness until an aircraft happens to fly overhead
They can at least see armor, are you sure they won't *try* to shoot it?
Yeah it wont
Which seems almost like a bug...?
:risitas:
The soldiers with like their 5.56 will shoot at armor but not a srad with a .50
and the F-45 one as well
the unit is here, maybe it was left out of the selector by accident?
why
`AEW-50` I think?
filename is AEW-50, object name is AEW-50, unit name has Bulwark but I don't think thats its ID
I thought that was fixed :thonkery:
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/884568240947355698 Guess this is still an issue in the editor
Yeah its a naming issue with the equip, I bet you can see this in the loadout screen as well
But both do use the 120D
Baha has mentioned planning on making the PT -> Stable cycle quicker
so, prob no longer than a month or two
v1.3.3 PT lasted 1.5 weeks with 3 versions
Id expect v1.3.4 PT will be longer as all the kinks with the editor are worked out
As a mission designer you can allow that
I had something like that happen once, wish I would have recorded it. The "pilot" seat in the slots was actually the guner seat, so I had to select the gunner seat to fly, but after I respawned it put me in the gunners position but without the radio panel and what not
was really odd
btw do  \`\`\` stuff here \`\`\` to make it look like ``` stuff here ```
Does that unit instance ID show up anywhere else?
no
I wonder why we don't
its there, it works in mp, but we don't have it in the editor
Maybe baha wants a new aircraft for team B rather than reskinned team A's one?
Tho would be nice in general to put any unit on either team
MAD-4's for everyone!
yeah they will be prompted if they want to download it
alternativly, one aircraft impact
For the mission editor? Yeah
No public ones
:thonkery:
I mean I guess that would mean we just have to write our own compiler
unless you mean like actual nasm in that case we can use any compiled language
wdym? Its all visual based
^
Its a unity game so C#
:Think: that changes nothing
no wait that makes it *easier*
as you can now use nasm or (the other one I cant remember) to compile to
Honestly if we did get support, lua or python or js would be good
something light weight, easily sandboxed, and that everyone knows
:Think: JS is excellent
Typescript is so close to C# that I picked it up without any need to study or learn
so if typescript bad, then C# bad?
It transpiles to JS
So anywhere that expects JS, you can use TS
also, all JS code is valid TS
so
compilation != transpiling
typescript adds no features to the language, just development tools
My point was that they are close enough that any valid complaint against TS could likely be levied against C#
also C# *sucks* for AOP
Im having to install an entire framework for something that takes me one line in TS
^
feel free to :Think:
Using the JSON converter is only helpful if you intend to write automated tools to work with VTS
If I was doing it manually yeah
:Think:
with a program id use JSON
?
Because programs cant read VTS
You can read it as *text*
Not as objects/classes
if I said "give me the position of the entity with id `3`" of a VTS file how much code would you have to write :Think:
with JSON, its just `data.units.find(unit => unit.id == 3).globalPosition`
or everyone just pressed respawn
Yeah it is
nan
wait your telling me I can fly in formation wih the E4 and KC-49 :risitas:
Once the mission starts the screen switches to the scoreboard and wont go back
Would be nice, even before the mission starts if you had your own briefing on your screen to control/flip through
your assumptions about what uses more preformance is likely correct. A unit staying still is better than a moving one, radar adds more complexity, air units while their physics is lower are going to be more expensive, ships are probably pretty expensive given the number of parts on them (gun turrets, radars, missiles, etc)
yes someone can, and that someone should be you
the map editor is free to be used by all
no one knows how to do it until they learn
I might be missunderstanding something im reading, but it looks like they should be able to kill bunkers?
Bunkers have a minimum damage of 150, tanks deal 151 damage
exported from the game
150
Which means anything that can kill it will kill it in one hit
unless min damage is subtracted?
iv heard recent reports that bunkers might be a bit buggy with when they take damage
150 as well
oh wait
the enemy tank
only does 125 damage
So allied tanks can kill bunkers, enemy tanks cannot
you can
500lb will
SBDs will as well
all bombs iirc
65s will I thought
145s wont tho
None exists rn
b61 works best
:itsfreerealestate:
you can have dev camera, im not sure if you need a headset for it tho
press insert on your keyboard
then use brackets
np!
press `del`
ah you just edited it :angery:
I wanted AGM 144s
aim280 cant kill anything
no they are fox4s
kek that would be great
yeah
its an infinite money glitch
I mean it is
but
just not a good one
takes a lot of fuel to run those carriers
the carrier burns more fuel than your selling, thus, the value never changes
nah I wanna know how much fuel I would have to sell
use in game
CFTs push it up to what like 13k?
CFTs do refuel as its counted as "internal"
nah its less than 21k
that might be with ext as well
but ext dont refuel
89 has internal radar and multiple evasion modes and an integrated RWR to make inteligent decisions
its far more advanced than a 161
161 technically has a TFR so its more advanced than a regular AGM but still not as complex as the 89
wait is it pvp?
I thought it was just who can refuel first
whats the min altitude for the tanker?
can you make it fly around/in terrain
:itsfreerealestate: that would be fun
low level refueling
either
:thonkery: how is this my bad dream
I didn't come up with this idea Yukari did
I mean I came up with the infinite money glitch a while ago but not a gammode out of it
you can tell SAMs not to engage missiles right?
ah
thats S-400 I thought
it does
yeah just have it if you get within 1km its a loss
nan
:KEKW:
or just
dont allow respawn
how tf are you even going to die?
I guess running out of fuel but thats on you
iv run out of fuel on multiple missions, they just cant be *super* short missions
what about F/A-26B Naval Strike?
Sure but even then you'll burn through your tank fairly quick
I really hope you are talking about unarmed drones
The fuck is wrong with you?
Russian, Ukrainian or whatever, these are real people with real lives
This isn’t a video game
The fact that you don’t understand that is deeply disturbing
There’s a reason why people like you should never be let near any weapons of any kind
Maybe that’s what you are saying now, that’s not what you said
Maybe get to know some of the peoples who lives have been permanently destroyed or ruined due to the things they’ve witnessed or experienced and you’ll be a little more stable
You can do it by modifying the VTS file but im not sure if thats a good idea
theres prob a reason its hidden in the editor
you can edit the VTS file but otherwise no
wait for what red elite has to say he knows more than me tho
ah ok so I was right
There’s no public list of feature requests and what not, but re-raising feature requests is a good way to show baha how interested people are in an idea
@ierdna100
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16DD8d1NudAGreoYmacUhVrwygP6oRgFtgGqJXnbI4Jc/edit?usp=sharing
:Think: I did
However, I wasn't home so I figured id ping you then I realized I had it saved somewhere else
im now free if you want to run through it
Lemme get on my vr stuff
not directly, but you can edit the VTS file or convert it to JSON then edit it there
He hasn't said its planned
but also hasn't said itll never come so we cna have hope
Iv written the code to work with VTS as json here if you want to use it https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTOLConfigNodeToJSON
Fair
python is prob better for something like this anyways
432hrs on linux :defaultdance:
Very valid
Don't question steam
"440 hrs in past two weeks"
"345 hrs on record"
its not even a faked photo its just steam being dumb
Uhhh not sure to be honest, I picked up JS as my first language so I don't know a lot about how to jump into it from an already experienced perspective
I could probably write a python version in a little bit
Yeah thats prob the best way to do it
no
that would mean anyone using the mission would need the mod
yes
cope
modifying the VTS file is the correct way to do it
but c# as a mod is better
you don't need to directly modify VTS directly if its a mod
as vtol already has the ConfigNode system so you just work with it the same way the game does
Looping with the ability to respawn/somehow procedurally spawn units would be :justright:
Hmm yeah its interaction with other objects would be problematic
Lua/some other scripting language integrated into the editor would be amazing
Python would be excellent for something like this
Really any easy to learn/simple/light weight scripting language would be great
JS/Python/Lua/Bahascript
Iv heard its bugged yeah
Lots of truth
I solve a majority of my problems just by talking out loud/talking to someone about the problem
Range will be lower for the helicopter due to low RCS, I’d recommend using a hill or something else to ensure they don’t get hit on the ground, plus just test to see
30k, 40 at the very most
oh
huh
I assumed it was 40k bcs thats the default alt warn for player aircraft
you always have the vts editing option tho if you wanna make it go higher
All the fixed wings are 40k right?
Heli is like 12 somthin
hmmmmm I could have sworn the ah was the only one different
Iv found it actually does quite well, its flaps produce nearly no drag but the wings/flaps produce a huge amount of lift
I remember for a time there was a hard limit to the game at 40k ft
it was exactly 40k ft
or just limit weapons
banning 145s for all aircraft would be good
Ehh, at least for the AH94 banning 145s is a great way to add a bit more challenge
in the 45 it matters less
spawn range is good if you want to have a formation setup/ingressed into the AO
but no more than 60mi required imo
thats the game version that the mission was created in iirc
its not publicly available
Wonder how large maps are when generated, could be a nice mod to cache lobbies to disk
its a reference point on the map people can make callouts in reference to
I mean it *is* a radar
6 per player running a2a would be reasonable/easy
Naval strike has something akin to 30
Of course those 30 don’t come all at the same time
Against how many players?
A wave of 4 is nearly nothing against even a single player
For the longest time the only team you could play on was team A, so it didn’t make sense to spend a bunch of dev time on ships you’d hardly see
Remove the zip bomb from the folder
it does work in mp sadly
Luckily the debug gun is disabled (as well as time accel)
It can refuel in a turn, so making it orbit is fine
But its far easier to intercept
send you files?
For the builtin ones?
"the mission" there are a lot of missions
There are many built into the game
otherwise yeah its on the workshop
you don't need the files just the workshop link like shadow is saying
why?
Why do you need/want those files?
Could always try google translate, but the files are just binary data im not sure how that would help you
Yeah here one second
nan
Like I said, its raw binary data so its not useful to you in that format but there you go
:Think:
Also @ierdna100 I gave him your mission :risitas:
thats the file for the one we were using to test headless client
I mean I only gave one file of the many that are required
and that file is encrypted
Internally fuel is typically a percentage, not sure if it’s the same in the mission editor but I’m guessing you want .5 fuel
Ah yeah so it’s probably a percent just not using decimals
You can always limit money
For a single player mission you can also force a specific load out which has a set fuel
nah
the best you can do is copy the unit and spawn it again
Go to "previous version"
Bahascript is the mythical solution to all our problems
The idea would be missions could have custom scripts written in some language (possibly a custom one) to add functionality
most of the time
:Think: I know jack shit about the editor
But I can say, if you try to fuck with it and try to trick it into re-running events I can basically guarantee it will break everything
Just a PSA, if you make a guns dogfighting missile that spawns you as a cold start you deserve the not allowed to make missions
And the very next mission im playing has *140nm* flight
Yes the FLKM-100
its a 16 player mission that you need one player to complete
Includes helicopters that also have to fly that 140nm
There really needs to be an in-lobby downvote button
and a way to see the mission rating before you join
Fobs are good, don’t spawn helis and planes in the same area. Limit the load out of jets so they can’t do everything, finally place units in cities/other hard to get places, that’s where the helicopters shine
Hmm I need a good “skill issue” emoji, iv got :skillissue: but that’s too bland
Would be nice if cities weren’t limited to grid tho that would need a large redesign to make working
Bcs it’s a grid it’s still easy for jets to line up shots it’s just annoying
Yeah uh I also want more than 2 FPS :risitas:
Infantry are good but they aren’t a threat to a heli at all, AAA also poses a good threat to helis and when placed in the correct area can really discourage aircraft from going in an area
That being said jets (especially F45s) are likely to target anything with a radar
Yeah AAA pretty spook
Tho it’s extremely spook in the heli
Also fun fact
AAA can fire at you without a radar lock
I blame the gun
It can’t handle acceleration
Prob AAA
And now that iv beaten it once I’m sure my second play through would be far quicker, I was taking it far slower than needed just to avoid pointless deaths
Yea but mission designers have a clear “style”, I know in general where to look for threats
It takes every bit of self control I have to not instantly hit the deny button every time I see it
Well gunners are just bad
Doing dynamic lib with Baha the other day and while that mission is far from hard when it comes to helicopter stuff, we did as good if not better than if I would have been on my own
Ok well yeah but still :risitas:
I think gunners are just in general bad
I think it’s the combination of three things - selection bias as gunning *seems* easier, so less experienced less skilled players choose gunning  - a large boost in new players to the game means average skill level is lower - gunning Is *hard*, being a good gunner is harder than being a good pilot
I mean the skill floor for piloting is also pretty damn low :risitas:
Yeeee that’s what I’m saying, skill floor being low = you can be really really bad at it
But yeah no I agree with your sentiment, it’s easier to be a meh gunner than a meh pilot
I just wish the slave button worked without TADS as SOI. Even really good gunners will have a bit of delay If I could just hit the slave button it would be great
What tf else is the pilot gunna be doing :risitas: gotta do something more than just sit there and look pretty
I guess some pilots like having the TADS up which I do see value in, but it seems like a waste given that your gunner is focused on that most of the time
Plus radar really helps SA as you can work out what is what
Night
We really need vote buttons in the lobby room for the mission, and a way to see a missions votes before we join
isn't there an "invincible" flag you can set?
why do so many people call their map "pvp/freeflight"
if you say its pvp
its gunna be just pvp
Btw to you mission designers out there, having one or two redfor slots with limited loadouts is very fun for making the enemy team less predicable and more of a challange
2003 Baghdad PVP/PVE is great, it has two redfor player slots that are 26's, and all they get are AIM-9s
No thanks
Well,  they shouldn't
the Receive Friendly Damage tag is new, maybe its bugged?
you left a team B slot im playing team B
I can hear the comms from the other people, I think its all helis :Agony:
wait no they have 42's as well ok its fine
Oh they also have lots of 45's and 26's lol
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/964337084435402782 I did too :risitas:
when you start the game there is a button on the bottom right
Could be nice addition as a command line arg
`-novr` or whatever
Its a flag in source engine iirc
Iirc you have to change the settings via steam but I could be wrong
16 total
So 8v8
But, you can do uneven teams if you want as well
There’s some missions that do like 14v2
Always remember to double tap the cockpit to ensure the pilot has zero hope of survival
Yeah they do gun runs
^ We need to know
Id have to calculate per-aircraft to get radar range, the SAM will fire at 14.5km
But, the RIM-67B isn't a very good missile, its fairly easy to dodge
Long burn time,  but terrible maneuverability
Ah lol, a mid tier option for the VLS would be nice
`[` and `]`
Oh lmao rip
For me, its the two characters to the right of the P
nan
ah yes, the person throwing snow left, and the person throwing snow right keys
Im pretty sure they dont
you could prob test by putting two tents next to each other, tents are super week but have a massive explosion
Unlike the RAT,  I don't see a hard coded maximum engagment range, the bullets can exist for 2 minutes before self detonating traveling at 510 m/s (I think)
So quick math would say it should be able to fire at a 45 degree angle for a range of 26.3km
wait do bullets have air resistance in vtol?
I have no idea
nan
depends if you include air resistance
As bullets don't have resist in vtol,  best is 45
At 510m/s theres no angle they can fire to make the bullet run out of time
Tho thats not counting the use of hills
the wiki is wrong about a great many things
Radar detection range depends on aircraft type/aspect/weapon load
A fully loaded 26b with lots of weapons can be detected from a *loooonnnnggg* range away
The FCR is about 50% worse than the 26b radar, detected at 50nm seems strange, if you show your belly + have external equips maybe
are you being locked by it?
Oh thats not detected
Inverse square law means you can get rwr pings from a *much* higher range than the enemy will see you
rwr just means you got a ping, but that dosn't mean the ping makes it back to them
He thinks he can make easy medium and hard all into one mission
*why* you would want that who knows
No as in, you select the mode in-mission
That makes it ***harder*** to use
and objectivly worse than just, selecting the mission
I never disputed the possibility
No way to do loops, your best option is to copy and paste the events a few hundred times
That event trigger will only happen once right?
it was my understanding that basically all events/triggers can only happen once
but
I don't make missions
so take everything I say with a grain of salt
If you are the creator yes
2km
Cheese I wrote script to do that for missiles, want me to just modify it for units?
Are units funnii?
Ah yeah
:Think:
The aircraft already despawn
They visually vanish
Its quick enough tho, its like 1 minute or something
Is there a timer as well? Iv killed AI on the ground and a few seconds later they vanish
But not immediately
I am testing
HC
maybe
yes
but for now
HC
MP compatible when :isforme:
Just beg bovine to bestow his divine wisdom
pog
we can test
cring
For marking airbases your best option is probably GPS points
:flooshing:
@Shadowtail
Try deleting this file `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\Welcome to the Jungle\image.PNG` and then re-setting the image/uploading
Try setting the image again?
You might need to restart your game again, but can you post a new player.log?
Bcs it would then have a different file name maybe? Dunno, something weird happening
That was sent before 9am and therfoe does not count as a valid message
What region did you say the server was in? If possible id recommend looking at moving the server to Europe or America, I wouldn't be suprised if some of the issues you've had are due to region specific issues in a less-popular area
Ah it was a specific API version, I don't use that version in any of my bots so I didn't notice it
No more than 25nm
You can put a bunch of slots in
You can have an unlimited number of vehicle slots
SAAW is a fairly low tech/small unit, it’s radar is likely incapable of intercepting missiles
If missile intercepting is needed, dosnt AAA do that job better?
If you need mobile, MAD4 works
Well can’t shoot and move at the same time
But can move to setup elsewhere
Boat works, could always dig a moat next to your road have have a boat going through it
More radars would fix yeah
You’d need more launchers tho, iirc a launcher can only have one radar
Also you can configure the radars to not engage the players
Which I’m sure would be a brain fuck, they see like 50 mad4s but none of them shoot lmao
Interesting, I have no idea how that would behave
Launchers have a launch-cooldown, so there’s a limit to some extent but yeah dunno
can you post your vtm/vts/vtc files? IIrc this has something to do with a weird ID/name miss match
thats one of the files, there should be a few others, specifically a `.vts` file
vtc = campaign vts = scenario  vtm = map
dosn't he have this?
well should be a version without the `b`
I can decrypt it if needed
lemme take a look
So my guess is the map isn't playing nicely because the IDs don't match
in the vtmb file the ID is listed as `Korengal`
But in the vts file it lists as `Korengal_1725346568`
Which also explains the name miss match between the folder `Korengal_1725346568` and the file `Korengal.vtmb`
Iirc the folder name needs to be the same as the file name
nan
I would try changing the folder name to just `Korengal` and updating the map IDs to `Korengal`
You said this was a workshop map right?
Has anyone confirmed workshop maps actually *work*? I wouldn't be suprised if the game tries to append the workshop ID to the map ID but isn't correctly updating the internally listed id
Well then I have no idea, the other possibly weird thing is `ScenarioTest1.5` has the ID `ScenarioTest#1.5`
No idea why the `#` is there
Ah yeah I don’t think you can have a # in a file path
Dunno if that is breaking it?
Well I dunno
Maybe, maybe not
No one has gotten in trouble for it, I believe its *technically* reportable via steam but steam will just take the workshop item down
yes
I have no idea how
but I know some missions do
Also some missiles just put an ungodly amount of AAA above an altitude
Do what the thunderdome map did then
Shit load of AAA up on cliffs
Put the AAA back far enough so they only get LOS when the helis get too high
Thats what I woulda done
If someone has to put in the effort to fully make a mission it’s more likely to be good than if they can just spend two minutes moving a single unit and uploading
I’m tempted to write a program to fully procedurally generate missions, it’s on my very long todo list of massive projects
Edited in read only?
Ahh
Oh my god it’s the same argument as earlier. Remove control from a creator just because some other people want it to be different :agony:
:Think:
Having had a project I worked on for over a year on get stolen, fuck off, it dosnt matter that it’s free, it’s still something being stolen
Starmap
There’s a reason it’s only partially open sourced
And why headless client will also only be partially open sourced
A personal project
:Think: you having access dosnt make it open source
That’s not how that works
No
I’ll hold onto your money for you if you want
Nah
I only owe money to C
I owe like 12 cents

Mission                                     Unit Spawns Dynamic Liberation (Hard)     670 F-45 Cooperative Mission       78 F/A-26B Naval Strike Mission 89
The built in coops don't even come close to dynam lib
Funily enough low tech pvp is nearly the same as the coops [LOW TECH] PVP Strike Mission 83
nan
it does somewhat, but not much
:risitas: spot the headless client testing maps created by @ierdna100
That being said, cities/roads play a very large role in map preformance
lots of cities will kill pref
nan
There I formatted it a bit more reasonably
Join team B
Hull number is just the number thats written on the boat, its got two ESSM launchers and one CIWS
Its possibly got two different radars, so it might be capable of using both launchers at the same time
Unless we get permission from baha, it’s pretty straight forward to reverse the process hence the fact that HC can show maps
Generally yeah I plan to have features that would allow for that, maybe not a pure time limit, but a clean easy to read game log with timestamps
:Think:
Temperz surely you understand how *breaking the game encryption* breaks the EULA
Well
for workshop missions you would be
for built in missions your distributing the game files
:Think: well if you want to do it the hard way I guess
It's not steam encryption
its baha encryption
:Think:
@Sypwn Did you remove the 145s from the delta internal bays?
Ah lol
Yeah makes sense, I wasn't gunna take bombs but now I have 53s :risitas:
Shadow is the one to talk to about that
But he’s mentioned he dosnt want to bloat it too much
Backstop are allied
I wonder... what proximity are you to the enemy when the SLAM truck fires at you @Green
AI Air units avoid friendly fire with ARMs, I wonder if ground AI dosnt
@Sypwn Any chance you could take a look at a campaign and figure out why its causing a black screen?
Its an invalid character in file path but I don't see any invalid characters anywhere
waiiit gimme 2 sec to test i just noticed something
Yeah ok got it
Game dosn't like CRLF line endings
:thinkening: that would be cheating tho
I don't believe thats possible
It seems like the answer is likely yes
at least the allied escort cruisers gun on the front is capable of targeting ground units
CIWS might be able to target ground units????? Im not sure,  I kind of doubt that
Id have to touch the mission editor tho
Were they within 5km of the ground targets?
Because I can answer some of the mission editor questions kek
The range of the allied cruiser is 6km, the max-range of a CIWS is 2km
Was the testing target within 2km? Im *guessing* it requires a radar lock to fire, but it can *see* tanks
actually no it can't see tanks, but it can see infantry/tents
I don't think it engages tanks
Armor units are different than non-armored
Id try infantry, or tent's
or both
lemme look
Nice
:risitas:
"fuck you in particular"
It looks like nearly everything is counted as "ground armor" even without having armor, anything with wheels is counted as ground armor, plus of course the bunker
The tent, solider, manpads, the static sam launcher, the static radars, and AAA are all "ground" and will be targeted
Out of curiosity, if you opened command prompt and ran `ping cdp.cloud.unity3d.com`, what does it say?
Open command prompt, type in `ping cdp.cloud.unity3d.com` and press enter
nan
nan
Do you have anything that would be blocking your internet connection?
No idea but its consistant with other workshop errors iv seen
Lemme see if I can find a dependency on it
Yeah I dunno, dosn't make sense that it would be required either, but I *have* seen it come up in a bunch of peopels logs with workshop issues
make sure travel times make sense
don't make the helicopter fly farther than 20nm
iirc you have to put a spawn for every slot you want
All MP missions must be a part of a campaign
If you only touch preview.jpg/png it should work
I know you can edit exclusively that loading screen
I thought it was one of the two, not sure
Either way it shouldn't have changed the map mesh itself even if you modified heat.png unless you regenerated the heightmaps
height0-3 are the ones actually being used for the mesh, unless those don't exist I think height.png is a fallback
Ah but in game the terrain was fine?
Interesting
Flying far in jets is fine
flying far in heli sucks
Aaaaaaa its valid for a mission to not have an image associated with it?
:Crycat: so many edge cases
:harold: also I see now that its not required for the images to be square
nan
Seems like it
lmao
you think my logs are readable?
Also like two seconds after that photo I restarted HC and broke everything so :risitas:
Also I almost never host lobbies so that alone would be suspicious
Watch it? No
Rip
Most units within the editor are metric, the speed is in m/s
np
For weapon stats I created this   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLWW-bbyfJEuQnnMmhSoCq39m3Ge5fxL11G_qbVDd88/edit  Iv been wanting to create stats for AI units for a while but it’s a lot more complex
As in AH-94 a2a combat?
Im not sure a gamemode like that would work at all tbh
It would need to be cities to have any hope of working
Mountains/valley then
not a plane
What weapons are you going to allow?
You can ask baha, I asked about the built in PVP strike mission and he said it was fine, but a campaign might be different I dunno, just gotta ask him
Ill grab it in a bit
max 2
its fairly integral to how the game is setup to support only 2
save-as
To be fair, I used to recommend people copy the files and directly modify them before someone told me save as worked :risitas:
Yea its not aircraft connected at all, you can see the icons through your aircraft even with full power off/no sensors on them
Wouldn't it also not work due to TGP IFF?
TSD shows as well iirc
wait maybe not, I might be remembering an instance I was in the heli
Being able to see player/unit names is a weird meta, would be nice to be a lobby option
Yeah 42c dosn't have radar at all, only the 94 can radar detect infantry
What the playercount/aircraft type? Seems like the perfect job for 2 26's running 4 CAGMs each
Oh... yeah I dunno about that tbh lol. You'll have to heavily limit the 45, otherwise a single 45 is going to take out every oil rig lol
145s can take out the legs of the oil rigs
you only need to take out 2 legs per rig
thats 16 legs
the 45 carries 24 AGM-145s
Could always place an infantry on the runway, its so small that its unlikely to be visible unless you get close or put your TGP directly on it
I don't *think* that will prevent AI from using the runway either
np
backstop is a BSM-66 equivalent
patriot has been buffed to be closer to the MAD-4
I havn't tested
They'll engage some ground targets, but not with missiles
only with their guns
if someone says there's ground below me and then drops me into the occean ima be mad
21.9km
with a min range of 1.2km
it is a scaled down super missile cruiser missile after all
nan
Its cruise motor produces 25 thrust for 40 seconds
an aim120's cruse motor produces 5 thrust for 18 seconds
:risitas:
The VLSanti-ship missile produces more thrust in cruise mode than the 120 produces for its boost mode
yeah its 20x draggier
Im many ways I actually think the anit-ship version is better than the regular super missile cruiser missile lmao
holy fuck
90 thrust for 5.5 seconds
and then 8 thrust for 30 seconds
15x drag compared to AIM-120
2km
Don't ping admin/mod unless you have an issue with the discord server
entity id -1 is what a player gets before they spawn
I don't believe they are their own static objects, so dosn't seem like its possible
they are just regular unity mesh's on the airbase
Interestingly the tutorials are static objects...? I have no idea what they do and there's no mesh for them
``` Tut_BasicFlight Tut_GettingStarted Tut_Weapons1 VFTraining1Prefab ```
They seem very custom so probably do nothing (or completely break) if not put in the right mission. `Tut_GettingStarted` and `VFTraining1Prefab` might do nothing at all, there's some lists that are just empty for those
iirc they can fuel off the team A aircraft
max level profiteering
sounds like it would start WWIII
all it takes is a single RWR to malfunction
For validation I wrote my own VTS parser, it dosn't spit out clean errors but it could help https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTOLConfigNodeToJSON
Anyways I honestly recommend some sort of version control, use a git repo and push changes before launching the game
Google drive seems like an... interesting solution lol
Honestly for projects that your working on for months, id just create a script that commits the changes to github then launches the game, then just always launch teh game through that
of what?
the effective radar powers?
There's no range chart
I already sorta made something like that
I was working on a tool for it
Its pretty easy
I could look into making an actual usable tool without all the over-the top extra I was doing
If I was a frontend dev, would be great
I however have none of the required skills to make something like that :risitas:
:Think:
Ierdna do you know how ot do UI?
As in you know Vue?
Or some other frontend framework
Thats the issue
teaching me "UI" isn't gunna help when I don't know how to make it in anything except Stormworks
its different per weapon type
Iv used GitHub desktop as a GUI, it’s simple and works well. I also tend to use Visual Studio Code as a UI for it as it’s also what I use to edit files
iirc thats the upload file size is too high
Primarily due to pictures
Its unlikely to be the units, dynamic lib has over 600 units iirc
so unless you've got more than that
Single picture is worth *thousands* lmao
The editor itself won't limit how many units you can place, limit exceeded means the file size was too large but units are just a few bytes for each one so
Make sure all the images are <1mb
np
nice
Yeah all mp missions are campaigns even if they only have one mission
anyone know why I wouldn't be able to make my mission public
Well I don't have steam guard enabled so lemme try that lmao
had to disable it for HC
Yep that fixed it, steam communicates this being a requirement *no where*
The AI will taxi/takeoff themselves, you just command them to takeoff
You don't manually create the paths for em
Yep all AI aircraft will taxi on their own
Ok good Sypwn is here, I have no idea lmao
Uhh you'll need nodejs installed, maybe ill setup a simple website to convert easier
Well I was gunna but
@Sypwn what sort of validation would be useful? First thing I thought of was checking `unitInstanceID` to make sure all IDs are unique
nan
VTS file
Making a website to convert between VTS <-> JSON, figure ill throw some validation checks on as well
Anyways im extremely shit at UI but here: https://convert.vtolvr.live/
Console will spit out useful information
@ISEGaming ^
> that would be awesome Issue is thats all UI heavy
which I suck at lmao
Ill add some more ID validation later, but that should handle conversion as needed
Tho I havn't really tested so :shrug:
The output looks ok and it converts between back and forth fine it seems
Could you send me a vts file with such errors so I can test?
IDs aren't indexes right?
I meant positional index
So I can just rearange things while keeping IDs the same
ah lol
The datastructure iv setup makes it pretty trivial to change IDs and what not, but, thats UI
nan
> that bad if you write a system that maps all ID references Yeah no the data-structure/manipulation side of it is trivial
Designing the UI to interface with that is hard
Uhhh :shrug: depends on what you want it to do
Make UI and ill make it functional
The website itself is open source https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTSConverterWebsite
somewhat #off-topic it would seem
^
lmao
I extremely rarely use the editor so I cannot comment
yes
I am going to implement whatever you need
but I can't comment on what you need
Whats `_el` @ISEGaming
of whats currently being dragged?
kk
Did you upload them to the workshop?
?
oh
I see
well I can retrieve them from the workshop
but only if they are yours
Well gimme the links
github!
I don't believe boats are ever removed
Its ok the allied carrier is op af so its fine
Yeah we need a weak carrier lol, PVP with the goal to sink the enemy carrier is fun but currently extremely favored to team A
like, if you don't have cruise missiles your only real hope is to ram the carrier
There's not *really* a way
just backup your mission files always
The "other" way is basically contact me lol, there *is* a way to recover from the workshop but you need custom scripts to do it
> How would a script help recover the files? The files on the workshop are basically encrypted, the script undoes that
After that your left with just a regular mission that you can edit
Only if they are your own
You can just ask @Chieh
yeah editor is almost entirely in meters
you can set altitude to ft
in some places
Yes
They may be broken for other reasons
But they can be converted
trigger kill the AI whenever the player spawns
So you *always* have N aircraft alive
Player spawns in, replaces one AI
Nothing new for VTOL :risitas:
sec I clicked a button and did something to my unity that I don't know how to undo
oh god restarting didn't fix it
Ok no i found it
nan
*technically*
Uhhh 10 degrees I think
9.05
80.95 degrees vertical
So -9.05 to 80.95, total 90degree vertical fov
ima try to export all the useful/important information about every unit
they can spawn that altitude
just because you can't do it in the editor
dosn't mean it can't be done
40k ft is the altitude warning, and also where the game used to hard cut off so you couldn’t go above so that’s what I assumed would happen
Its nothing fancy, but if you are ever looking for specific stats on units here you go
if someone wants to make that into a google sheet or some other good visualization please do
also lemme know if there's any metrics/stats iv missed that I could add
Could also instantly respawn the unity `N` times to make it effectively have more health
tho that would prob look weird to anyone looking too hard
Also wouldn't work with moving units
at least not without a shit load of events and what not
The in game tutorials don't have any gif/video's pop up
I *think* iv done the tutorials but its been a hot minute, I believe the only sorta thing is the text/on-button pop-ups, which mission creators can use in SP
Maybe its related to one of those special static objects
You have to datamine a bit
What would it compile to?
VTS isn't a programming language
You could serialize the ConfigNode format, which is what VTS is
Bundle? Yes thats how they are stored
hence the whole datamining aspect
The files aren't just cleartext shipped with the game
you have to export
and then dig them out of another file
It should be compatible
Unless baha radically changes something in an upcomming patch
Which is unlikely
Radical changes are no different working on ptb than working on stable to be fair
The only difference is if a new feature on PTB gets changed specifically, which could happen
Other than that, no issue working on PTB
Ultimately a stable update could break things the same way a ptb update could break things
You'll be fine a vast majority of the time
no :risitas:
Yes, tons
modders knew it was multicrew attack heli with AG radar and a bunch of weapons like months before it was released
But yeah no updates in a month makin me excited for whatever is coming
the less baha says the more hyped I get :risitas:
Im guessing skin support personally
Neat
The moment I see a mission creator use it im leaving lmao
Which tutorial uses it?
Ok *this* is a good use of it
indepedenece day, it does work
No
You can do some things the mission editor won't let you do
like putting buildings in weird places
or units where they normally can't be
For what? Pref? Dynamic lib has 1000+ spawns with like 25% spawning
Depends on the type of unit and what you have it doing
If your goal is to make a comp mission, limiting budget will mean good players never kill each other with AIM-120s
In a "comp" setting, spamram is not a viable tactic, its never more effective than a single missile. But missiles specfiically timed at different energy states *is* important
Iirc there's a position value in the vts you can tweak that dosn't actually move the airbase but does change where trees can/can't spawn
Ah
Sypwn does
he'll prob help once he's done with heling me
yes, but they don't work in mp
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718727127
Mission made using them ^
it would prob sync incorrectly
Baha will likely fix it at some point, but if you want to look for a work around, it seems somehow related to ASF-30 [208], my guess its unit group/unit group actions somehow
If I had to guess, having the AI aircraft in the same group as the rocket boats fucks up something
Well there's the problem
I couldn't be bothered to type it out
Go to `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR\SaveData`, open `gameSettings.cfg`, and set `EULA_AGREED = 1`
For what it’s worth yes ground units can do some truely impressive terrain nav, so it could make it, but yeah just fix it
Ok yeah, nothing is consistent
They *can* make it up that ridge
If they choose to in this situation
Who knows
these two folders have what you need
Collide with boats*
Iirc there's no collision with most ground units
Yeah two good players with guns will win, one can just defend the entire time while the other comes around the back
:risitas:
That would be fun lmao
it has to do diving passes, when I messaged around wtih ah94 vs fixed-wing, while the 94 lost every time a few of the passes a bullet or two would hit me
so with 15 helis
might win
> Anybody know if it is possible to spawn a multiplayer spawn AV42 with troops inside Its not, only in SP. In MP you have to spawn the troops nearby and tell them to load in  >  players the choice of what jet to spawn You can do this by placing a bunch of mp spawns and letting the player choose which slot they want
Prob just make it heavy
Command it to taxi, then add a trigger to the location you want them to taxi to to command it to takeoff
I believe the TWR requited for all VTOL AI is 1.1
1.05 for VTOL landing
Looks like for landing you can force them to vertical land and they'll jettison equipment until they have a 1.05 TWR
no
I know extremely little about mission editor stuff
Yes but requires some work/extracting the game
I would have to entirely write the AI and the physics
Yes there are buttons on screen when you first launch the game
they have them built in, so yes wasting time
In 1.5 yes
Well now in 1.5
On stable branch no, once a unit is dead its dead
Yeah baha probably dosn't even know
Dosn't seem to be, your best option would prob be to add a slot that you tell every unit on the map to not engage
I looked and there dosn't seem to be a way to call it on a player, uses different methods
Why do you need to be flying around, why don't you just use insert camera?
devcam
the camera you get by pressing insert
yes
Sounds like you need HC lol
Not even a plug just another tick on the list to convince me to actually work on it
The BFM thingy *is* HS
Tacview, but live, and without mods
it is
In the same way the BVR mode is a branch off
nan
No
Sort of
They are two different gamemodes
They share a vast majority of the code
Two
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1035382815392534578/1035383601853911200/unknown.png
What it looks like ^
kek
I have this on #public_testing except now that channel is dead
Nah I just tend to leave it open on my third monitor lol
Iv heard rumors that radar horizon is actually simulated in vtol but I haven’t been able to confirm
Put valleys/hills in such a way so if you fly low enough you can stay out of LOS
There’s not really a max height
Generally both radars and missiles do better against high targets
Yea the website is down for a bit, I need to setup some VMs to do I can run multiple projects. Rn I’m running HS, so I took HC down
For my services I do, and I have it behind nginx so I can map different domain names to internal services
Issue is, both HC and HS require an owned copy of the game, so it requires steam. I need a solution that allows me to either have multiple steam installs, or a VM
Yea, and more specifically the issue is there’s no way (at least no obvious way) to setup different accounts for different services. I tried docker but ran into some issues getting steam to run inside it
It just dosnt work
I’m fine with just running multiple accounts
It dosnt “use a steam account”, but it’s through Steamworks, so it counts as running the game
Also we should go to #off-topic before Sypwn wakes up
There is a max range and angle, it’s just *height* is unlikely to hit those limits
If you wanted to implement a height yourself, it’s probably possible with 1.5 features, but I’m not sure why you’d want to, it’s fairly unrealistic
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16DD8d1NudAGreoYmacUhVrwygP6oRgFtgGqJXnbI4Jc/edit#gid=0
nan
boats use special net syncs right?
They use the downloadData same as players iirc
nan
its a specific way of syncing data, not a regular RPC
its "better"
and yeah boats use it
the netcode can take shocking amounts of abuse
Yeaaaaa I did get a lot of soft-locks, but mostly just the client waiting on something that never happens
To be fair I also wrote a C# version
Tho no idea why I didn’t just steal Baha’s :shrug:
It’s not unity
It’s semi-custom based off ConfigNode’s from KSP
The serialization/deserialization exists in the regular source for the game
Well I wouldn’t have put it on GitHub
Only reason that vts to json exists is I needed it for HC and figured it would be useful to other ppl
I simply woulda skipped the GitHub step
Actually iirc I haven’t even published the C# version
That’s just used for HS
Fly 60 minutes, get nailed by a random hidden manpad?
Iv wondered if I could do this on HS by telling everyone than everyone else is on the other team
So team a would see both team b and c as a part of team “b”
No reason it couldn’t be for AI either
Well ig it would require a mod lol, there's no team information attached to network entities at all, so I can't even try to spawn it on the other team
The issue is we *can* mod basically whatever however we want, its simply not done more just because *its hard*
How would that work? Baha would basically have to open source the unity project lmao
My biggest question is *how*? What could be done to make it easier?
I have no idea what you mean tbh
So the issue is no one is making things, baha changing things wouldn't fix that
ask in the modding server
well yeah CSA should be base game
that much I agree with
We've mentioned it a bunch of times without baha saying anything
Nah order does not matter
Not sure, but id just put em at the top
Should prob move to a thread, or #off-topic, not super mission-editor related
No tester role so dosn't count
No signs at all
Can *single player* have it?
Because know multiplayer has never had it
Wiki isn't a ground source of truth, and those are just example callsigns
Can you send me a link to the mission?
Sex
If you are the mission creator yes
otherwise you have to ask the creator for the files
Mobile so no link for you
There’s the zip somewhere for units specifically
Can't you GPS CCRP?
Idk if you get CCPR symbology off GPS for a dumb bomb, or if its only TGP
yea GPS bombs in dumb will CCRP to a GPS
Tbh regular dumb bombs not CCRPing to GPS points seems like an oversight/bug
Send your player.log
uh
that dosnt seem right
Why?
Why would the plane be able to CCPR off of a TGP point, but not off a GPS point?
CCRP is an extremely old technology
And the TGP having CCRP but not GPS points seems like an extremely random/arbitrary limitation
no I have no idea what you are talking about
Arbitarailly less accurate when its a GPS point vs when its a TGP point?
a point is a point, the aircraft shouldnt be magically more or less accurate
Why would it be any harder than with the TGP?
Dropping off the TGP and dropping off the GPS should be identical
so
nothing to do with the bomb
or with CCRP
you are simply saying its harder to get a GPS point than a TGP point?
this is what confused me
you were talking about some sort of "less accurate ccrp"
That seems likely to be a bug, when you post it make sure to include a full log file (and a vts file if possible)
Send me a link
No rush lol ill be here all day
done
> If you can't figure things like this out yourself, then you probably shouldn't be messing with the VTS file :Crycat:
Only if you are the creator
Yes some have min-range, ill check what its set to for the slam truck
1km
Baha reads most messages in #vtolvrdev, just generally don't expect a reply lol
Post it there, but its a semi-major change so don't keep your hopes up lol
Tuesday dosnt *normally* cause client routine crashes, but I’d wait till tomorrow to see if it still happens
Steam maintenance happens on Tuesday’s
Causes many mp issues
the ASF-30s radar is about 20% worse than the 26b's (inverse square law prob means its *range* is less than 20% different, but thats output power), the AI 26b has an identical radar to the player radar
Are you sure they are getting targets on radar and aren't just turning to them via RWR?
Yeah just looking at their stats I don't see why they would behave differently
Log file might have something useful, tho I don't think it shows rwr detections
MP vs SP
Your RWR filters out non-player friendly RWR contacts
So you'd only see an AI 26b nails if you were on team B
make em heavy
I already did
You'll have to decompile the game
@Sypwn may have them on hand
16
You can put infinite player spawns but only 16 players can connect
Positive
> every single other plane dies when taking a direct missile hit (as you'd expect) except the f/a-26 Iv seen the F-45 tank missiles many more times than iv seen 26b's, unless you mean AI?
for AI iv exported their relevent stats here https://canary.discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/1029607562598948965
And missile stats here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLWW-bbyfJEuQnnMmhSoCq39m3Ge5fxL11G_qbVDd88/edit#gid=2059608664
All the player aircraft can survive AI missiles from time-to-time
Actually looks like functionally the AI F-45 should have more HP lol
> why is that Dunno maybe baha meant to update all of em but got sidetracked
I don't think its meant to be like that lol
The game will break after a little bit tho
The big issue I had is with the mission timer
it would rollover and all radars would break
somewhere around 24hrs iirc but I could be wrong
is why HS does autorestarts once an hour
Looks to me like a unit group issue again
Is the ship in a weird unit group, such as sharing with an aircraft?
There's a rocket boat in Echo group
Which is an aircraft grouping
nan
No problem!
There was some talk of skin support awhile ago, by why lol
In `AppData\Roaming\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR\SaveData\pilots.cfg` you can modify pilot names
@houstonderk  > I just want a dynamic liberation match with only 1 life... lol All i see is kamakaze pilots, although yesterday someone screamed as they were going down and it put a little more emphasis on it...  Issue is with a public lobby you are basically never going to get people who care/are capable of one life, so you'll have all the slots in the lobby depleated after only a few minutes lol
I thought about running a "hardcore" HS PVP lobby to see how it went lmao
One life and then your banned
@Jaidensky did a full solo zero death run on hard mode
Something like 460 kills iirc
> stopping from a rejoin on that one match On that *one lobby*, so they are gone until you fully rehost the lobby
The mission creator can set it to 1 life slots and then they have to watch the briefing room map until the next match
You'll have to astro about that, he pushed back on adding more data in the past
Yes, but the lobby host can choose to allow any skin as well
mach .8 seems like a reasonable airspeed
Tbh, there's probably a reason baha has the player count set to how its set. One of the reasons HS is only 16 players is for that
Probably as its generally not a great look for a game to be laggy/jittery, so the 16 player limit is to prevent it from being *too* bad
Ah
ok
I mean yeah thats very possible but the road of mod loader working with vanilla is :sus:. HS Accessor does it but takes extra precautions
are you looking via insert cam?
Did you press insert on your keyboard, or did you fly over to it
terrain far away has an LOD, which can make it look like things are floating
