What wire do you normally catch? 3m difference shouldnt change much if you are going for 2-3 wire
VCAP bad :bob_gun:
:tonk: hand flight gives you more control and is more fun
VCAP has gotten me killed more than manual
If you transition manually its easy
For a regular hook landing in the F-45 its identical to the 26, for VTOL its just a game of come up next to the carrier, reduce your relative speed, translate over, and touch down
kill
If they say "power" means you have **way** to much and need to reduce throttle to zero and airbreak
:tonk:
Fully situational, are you fast? Just increase pitch, are you slow? Increase throttle + pitch. If you neither just increase pitch and increase power a *little* bit
To learn people find it easy to use the speed AP so they can ajust their pitch however they want and still land
I dunno, I eye ball everything. Just give yourself more room than you think you need
Something iv found helps me is not to think "I am landing on this runway" rather to think "I am falling on this spot"
Basically, fuck around, and if you find out fuck around in a different way
:risitas: I landed first try today
210 is normally my target landing speed :mildpanic:
:itsfreerealestate:
gotta stress test the cables for in case of emergancy
yes
Actually rephrase what you said
> Would the 26B be best ~~for practicing carrier landing?~~ yes
26 just best aircraft hands down
:tonk: :Doubt:
24 ballistas wont do shit when im going 1000+ knts
45 is nice but 26 is just god tier
:tonk: so
Iv yet to really have a 45 be able to use stealth to seriously cause me issues
The system better not fucking touch my gear
Thats what wso's are for
:tonk: I didnt either because its as easy as flipping one lever while im still a mile out
the 26 can maintain level flight at 105 knts
What, you *dont* refuel at a 90 degree bank?
Pathetic
Sadly theres no way
Its up to the map designer to have it fly in a sane manner
Today a tanker almost hit me out of the sky as I was flying near its wing when it suddenly decided "yep time to turn"
>  I generally wouldn't bother, since they can just as easily turn away and waste your missile It depends on who you are fighting, it can be extremely useful to force people defensive
you can AB in the 26 for over 40 minutes
:itsfreerealestate:
Unless you use the *F O R B I D E N T E C H N I Q U E*
Nah F-45 bs
If you are looking at your TSD while IR missiles are fired at you something has gone terribly wrong
wat
:tonk:
If an IR is being fired at you without knowing the source you've lost all SA
Which is like
the whole point of a 45
@Birdman_WA wat
TSD on yes
However looking at it while IR is fired at you :tonk:
I *guess* if its a ground based IR launcher
Even then tho, I think you should be keeping your eyes on target
Simply see the target :tonk:
I dunno, if your in a no SA situation in a 45 then something has already gone terribly wrong
Even then id just use headtrack mode on the ETOS for finding/engaging it not the TSD
Sure but
bad
If within range to be hit by IR then imo you should be doing everything using the HOTAS without looking at the screens
Actually I wonder if the aircraft are more likely to survive when hit from a specific spot :hmmmmmmmmmmm:
Against just AI or against players?
In general, hide in mountains, stay low, stay out of sight, use the F-45, don't have external pylons
Then yeah, do that ^
Any/all, AV is the easiest but they are all pretty easy to pick up
Yes, you have to make sure you setup windows with voice recognition but yeah
:tonk: Anyone who has more than two braincells will hopfully avoid this, and if you miss your as good as dead as now your in a flatspin with nearly no airspeed
Never will be truely invisible, the slower you are going the better however it only masks *so* much
Also iirc it dosn't matter if the aircraft is scanning down or up, it only matters the target aircraft altitude
Best altitude is 0-500ft, starts getting worse above that
Oh hey I don't think you can lock ppl that are on the ground anymore
so thats new
Yeah I don't understand all the math, but I think at around 200knots and 500ft is optimal @Blitzcreeper
Or 400 ft if you are over water
Yeah its raycast downwards
Dunno what you mean
:tonk:
Well
yes
but
:bob_gun:
Eh it wouldn't add much tbh, your not going to see such a huge difference
Also @Temperz87 ur wrong
It uses a raycast rather than a linecast here
25000
:shrug:
I mean... yeah? Its not a hard cutoff, its a linear range between 500 and 25000
Just getting lower than 500 has no extra benefit
@Blitzcreeper Distance D is used to determine how masked the aircraft is
Thats the smallest it can be yeah
Even a fully laden F/A-26B (iirc twr ~0.65) will be able to take off without too much dificulty
So the max takeoff weight is higher than is possible to achive in VTOL
I wonder what the max for a successful catapult launch is...
I know iv landed one with a ~0.65 twr but cant remember if I managed to take off
:tonk:
And no atmosphere
and zero friction
also the fact that I can overbudget on a free-flight mode is weird :tonk:
Well not free-flight, im using the carrier landing map but still
Ye I tested it, and managed a no burner .63 takeoff like Skumby said
Tho, if I shut an engine off it wouldnt actually let me launch
What C-137 is a great rule of thumb, but really its about - length of runway you are approaching  - desired approach angle - current approach angle - desired airspeed - current airspeed - desired aoa - current aoa - aircraft weight - etc So you really just want to make a decision based off what you are trying to do, if you need the extra lift change the flap settings. Sometimes I land with full flaps, sometimes I land with none, its all about situation
In general, slowing down will increase your aoa, increasing flaps setting will decrease it
Depending on how much weight I have I end up being too floaty with flaps2
170knts?
Would be cool to see the emergency arrestor wires at the ends of the runways
Btw, RWR is not perfect, it can easily miss a missle, especially if its moter is burned out or if its coming from a bad angle. Keeping your eyes on the target at all times is very important to watch for missile launches, additionally try to anticipate when the target will launch, you shouldn't assume just becase you havent seen/heard a missile that it dosnt exist
you can actually, someone recorded the values a while ago
I find AP hurts more than helps really
TWS, or 'track while scan' refers to marking a target and tracking them, while still scanning for other targets
Its what you see when you press on a target once, and see the circle+number come up
We also have a mode, I dunno if it would be called TWS.. maybe "TWL", where you can continue tracking targets while hard-locked on another
this allows for employment of multiple AIM-120s on different targets at the same time
(and AH-96)
:Think:
Yeah it can fire on 4 targets at the same time
When you are in STT all your TWS targets will still be painted, and guidence can be done by TWS
yeah
As long as the targets remain within the cone of your radar and the tws isnt lost for any other reason yep it will track
It dosn't change TWS as afaik the radar acts like an AESA type radar, its better for detecting targets not already tws'ed
I believe STT has the same effectivness of TWS
lemme double check
Yeah a TWS has the same "ability to track" as STT
The AIM-120 only needs a hard lock to fire, the moment its off the rail you can remove the hard lock
STT might give a *slightly* higher track resolution, im not really sure. TWS will update 10 times per second
you asked there nearly exactly the same time you asked here, you waited less than a minute lol
Sure but this makes it sound like your expecting something that fast
Its roughly equally as active as here
proportional to size ofc
@admin
We need that moderator role to get some people. Well Themorris is here anyways but
Keep them in line of sight
Spamming chaff dosn't *hurt* so might as well, by spam I mean press it at a nice rate, not dumping it all at once
only 16 'bits' of chaff are calculated per aircraft so more than that dosnt really help
Accuracy isn't hurt, but the scan rate goes *way* down
yeah lol
25ish-30 nm is the max range they will typically launch a missile at, the missile could go farther but dunno. The radar is the limiter
If you can't see the missile, the missile cant see you
No other method will work 100% of the time, get *really* good at terrain masking
Even the tiniest little bit of terrain can be used to mask in if done correctly
step 1: never be 30000ft up
Well, you can be that high
but the moment you fire a missile, you need to be diving to the ground
also christ I pulled 17 g for like a solid second
Ye
but, depends heavily on range, type of missile, and starting alt
Im only a few hundred feet off the ground here, so I don't really have the option to drive it into teh ground
And MAD-4s tend to fly a more direct path until closer anyways
Eh, between 15-20 is fine for the starting engagement however I am always watching for where I plan to go once a missile is fired at me
:Think: it works you just have to be more carful with the terrain
You can maintain radar lock and fire if your target is above you, while using a moutain to defeat their missile
Its a circumstance you can easily force
Thats a *very* common situation for me, Im basically always forcing fights to end up like this ^
:risitas:
Iv said it in the past, ill say it again, the trick to winning BVR is to lead opponents where you want to fight em
Not in like, run away make em follow you
but general positioning, timing, choosing when to fly perpendicular rather than at them etc etc
Depends, some yes some no
Much of the BVR strats they use are classified
but I sometimes show my dad videos of the dogfights iv done
Do it and fail a shitload
thats what I did
The coop missions are fun, ima try the navel strike solo later today if I have time
:angery:
Unfair
Id recommend going against people higher in skill as well, its *really* frustrating but each time you die make a conscious thought of "what went wrong"
even now, every time I die in any situation I try to acknowledge exactly what went wrong
And watch what the other guy does, learning your opponent can really help and mimicing what they do is useful to learn new things
plus just trying things, even now (especially in BFM) ill go 'you know what, what happens if I do x', most of the time it fails spectacularly, but sometimes it works
Ox has some good BVR videos iirc
:Agony: ok well maybe not that
You can use AIM-120s to shoot down incoming missiles if you really wanted to
nan
Using missiles to shoot down missiles is always my last resort, try every other method first
Ye its the 'ban' button
Ah
well that argument works as well
Ok but some people do so
p much
missile spam is a chronic issue
Yeah money system would be really nice, balence becomes an issue but ye
Well VTOL already has a money system built in, its just unlimited for missiones rn
And in general, more stats would be nice. Showing a difference between A/A and A/G kills, plus showing total missiles fired vs missiles hit
Id like to just see a kill gives you some money
Say, one kill equals like three missiles worth of money would prob be a good ballence
Eh a bit? Its just a reward for getting kills
It wouldn't be like a HUD pop up with `+100$` whenever you get a kill, but after you RTB/respawn youd see the amount you gained for that flight
Perhaps even you have to RTB to get the money
Oh nice
So hopfully once custom missions are in that gets added
I never do the objective anyways :hawhat:
Hey I protect the people doing the objective
its called teamwork
Indeed
:KEKW:
I was watching that
I did a 1v3 guns only against asf-30s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiGPDSMrm0
:thonkery:
Depends on the map
I can get all the MAD-4s in the navel strike mission with only guns
I mean mad-4s only have 4 missiles right? thats easy enough
Actually I’m pretty sure I could just drive them into the ground
Especially if I was running a clean jet, I’d be pretty stealthy and fast
If that, the MWS is not perfect
Hoom yes 0 rcs f-45
nan
The poor E-4 :risitas:
Also I like how the KC-49 is just as stealthy as the AV if its comming right at you
nan
:Agony:
Want some circles?
Yes :risitas:
wum?
Im simulating like nothing
well I did spend a bit of time optimizing the brute force algorithum but
:Think:
The number of dots does get laggy after a while
but thats like, when there are 50k of them
I need baha to fix RCS so I can see the trade off between doppler notching and RCS
RN you can combind both notching and best RCS and get an insanly low value
:KEKW: would you have rather one sided PVP advantages for some magic reason?
But yeah rn a 26 can get like within 6mi of a mad4 radar if it comes in from the right direcetion
Or closer actually if you came in slower
:risitas: yeah we had planned to test it in game
The flight assist does its very best to trim the aircraft
If you have no damage, you will fly level
the hud is the HUD
the head mounted stuff is the HMCS
in the F-45 the HUD/HMCS are combined into the HMD
Im fine with BRAA, but im terrible at converting from bulseye to my bearing
I wish you could select the bulseye on the TSD like a GPS point
sometimes I place a gps point on it just for that
You already can play ATC, @ierdna100 used to quite a bit
Fly up to the ATC tower and start talking to people
Well the aircraft themselves have that so
Typically the ATC would be in an F-45 which gives 360 deg FOV for the TSD
hes using hte A-10 mod so
> more speed you need to bleed that makes you pass out from g's How much speed you have to bleed is fully under your control, more TWR just means higher top speed and higher acceleration
And yes, it increases your max sustained turn rate. Your max sustained turn rate is defined as the rate at which you can turn without loosing speed. As you turn harder AoA goes up, as AoA goes up drag goes up, at some point drag due to AoA will equal thrust produced, and you are at your max (sustained) turn rate
> more speed turns you faster Ehh to some extent, there is a sweetspot for the 26 a bit below mach 1 where you are at optimal, above that and your turn rate starts going down for a number of reasons
Which is why turn rate graphs have a peak, then a dip
:Think: its the same aircraft for each line
Its showing the F-16
Just each line shows different considerations (such as CAT-1 limiter)
Well, no, but actually yes
Yeah you can only technically track one target at a time, but you can quickly switch which target its tracking
No, in the F-45 missiles will continue on the predicted target path even if no sensor on it
After like, 15 seconds(?) of no update the track file will fade and the missile will go dumb
but even while the taget is flashing you have a chance to recover teh missile
Yeah I wish there was at least a small recovery window for the missile
that being said the radar FOV of an AIM-120 is insane
It should *not* be able to see in 180 degrees in front of it
Its 180 degrees
Oh you mean IRL?
I can't find any info about hte IRL one so I dunno
I asked my dad and he said he couldnt tell me :Crycat:
It should datalink, but maybe the datalink for ai works differently?
I think so
Yeah
People like manuals for the fun of it, and to learn checklists are good
If the computer is saying landing gear maybe you should put your landing gear down :Think:
Indeed
I really wish we had gear over speed, I see people taking off at like 280knots
Ahh
What’s the specific issue? It’s a long mission with lots of units so you’ll have to use lots of different strats and weapons
Also how many people are you doing it with? It’s meant for 6, pretty doable with 4, but with less than that gets fairly difficult
If you want to see the way I did it, I did a solo run of it https://youtu.be/5n9nao990Kk (1 or 2 people it’s fairly similar)
(I recommend watching at 2x speed and skip the long portions of me just flying around)
Also I made a pretty major mistake, I was taking the wrong cruise missile so ended up wasting a lot of time
If your talking about the Britgun seminar that happened a few times, now that quantify is gone I don't think anyone is running them
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699343586084520087/918413192017883136/unknown.png
I use it when im close (<10 mi) and the target is behind a mountain, having POINT on is a great way for me to be 100% sure when the target is in LOS to me
I do quite a bit, but when your that close EOTS takes too much time/ill know when they fire anyways
Or sometimes ill have EOTS on another target that I want to keep tracked/watching for launches
While budget and weight are considerations, imo theres really very very limited reason to use them, other weapons such as an AGM-65 are better suited for close range/high capacity anti-ground munitions
Yeah I saw that on your sheet lol
was confused
still am
Don't pylons have a bit of mass?
:Think: ok then where is it
Oh fun fact
You have to pay for the pylon on the internal ones as well
its just 100 vs 500
:Think: Yes there is
nan
lmao
Wait is the rail cost multipled by the number of missiles...
For the internal 2x, unit cost is 100
For the external 1x, unit cost is 200
Yeah but I would expect the cost of the rail to be 200 for the 2x, 100 for the 1x
but its the other way around
im wondering if it multiples the cost by the number of missiles
so 100 x 2 to be equal
The base cost for the internal (2x rack) was 100, wheres the base cost for the external is 200
But on the sheet Ierdna has its marked as the same cost
the 1x
the 2x
Maybe Ierdna's sheet is wrong, I should check in game
Ah nice
The 26 can easily do un-arrested landings and unassisted takeoffs tho
Imo EOTS dosn't need a nerf, I just wish the 26 NIGHT mode worked the same as the 45's NIGHT mode
45 is better ground pounder, the the 26 is better at doing multiple things at once
the 26 can carry a good AG loadout while also carrying a2a, whereas in the 45 you are very limited in the ability to carry both at the same time
That being said,  I stand by the 26 being nearly as good as the 45 if it weren't for that EOTS NIGHT mode
Baha has stated the 26 isn't meant to contend against the 45 in pvp, so I don't think he has any intention of making large balencing changes
Tho, one of sorta BS things hte 45 could do with its AIM-120s was actually a bug and will likely be fixed in the next patch
The ability to lock on despite being no where even near an aircraft
nan
Technically the 26 could do this as well, but in effect never happened bcs of the requirement ot keep radar lock
AIM-120s rn have a 180degree internal radar which wasn't intended
Its.. complex yeah
Theres lots of math that I don't understand, from what I can tell...   It seems to be better the more you are notching (no factor for terrain here) The chaff has to be in the radar FOV to be effective 16 "bits" of chaff will be simulated at any time (per aircraft)  chaff gets less effective over time until it decays
Chaff has no effect on radars, only missiles and ground guns like AAA
I don't believe you can use chaff to break a lock, you but you can use it to make the missile/gun target an incorrect position
Chaff effects missiles differently than ground clutter, as far as I can tell the effects of chaff have zero interaction of the presense (or lack there of) of ground clutter
Nooooooo up is bad
For like
3 different reasons
maybe 4
no
death
death is what is up
- Lower density atmos means better missile preformance and worse aircraft preformance  - Zero ground cluttering/notching dosnt work - Radars get a buff when they are looking low -> high (not very much, but some) - No chance of letting the missile hit the ground - No chance of breaking LoS
the only advantage to going up is that if you manage to defeat the missile and not die to a million metal fragments shredding through your cockpit is that you'll be in a better spot to fire back from
np
radar mechanics are very fun in this game
@Baconism loves me because ill be in plain sight be he still cant lock me :risitas:
Either depending
I prefer F-45 for PVP
PVE typically
I prefer the 26 in general
However, in PVP the 45 is better
So I fly that instead
That being said, I stand by that the 26 can 1v1 a 45 and be roughly equal
Yeah I hate autoflaps lmao
Every time im in the 45 thinking im about to get a 3 wire the autoflaps go no haha time for a 4 wire
in one axis, yes
You have to manually control it, its typically called vectoring in flight, or "viffing"
This is the proper way to land a 45
:hawhat: what do you mean, that’s the proper way to land
:risitas:
I do single one release, and just press the button as many times as I need
I use it when I am absolutely sure I’m safe (well not off, but mute), for when day I’m RTBing, or landing on the carrier for 26 strike, or free flight etc etc
Only reason to turn it off is if you have duel engine failure and apu failure and need to land
Turning off the rwr will save some power
AIM-9 intersepting is boring, easy and needs no skill and can't be countered due to a bug rn
I use it sometimes, but its a last resort
Its an issue that means you cant fire two AIM120s at the same person
No you just cant fire two AIM120s at the same target
Unless you have a radar on them
Itll be fixed soon tho
they are far worse than AIM-9s lol
There’s like 5 different shadows
3 of them actively play vtol
There’s two chases, the other one was fairly active but it’s been a bit sense iv seen them
lmao
that match was rough
dosnt help that my teammate was spawncamping
multiple teammates were, but Ember was strafing the grond
yeah..
I TKed ember a few times after that lol
Yeah I agree
Hold on lemme get the video
of a 26 taking 3 shots directly to the head
I just wish you couldnt shoot after loosing both engines
ASMRM-7
Mark enables the visible laser you can see with NVGs
Point tells the radar to STT any target you select on the TSD
Single target track, basically lock on
nan
Personally, I use it to ensure I’m looking at a correct track, not a predicted one, as well as know I’m in line of sight to my target
Ye, it’ll still be correct without Point, it’s just a bit harder to tell that it is
God I wish
Iv by dying to have the ability to tell what sensors can see what target
The F-45 dosnt have a TWS mode that you have to select, but it will create track files for anything the radar can see when not in Point mode
Missile will track with TWS
Need STT to launch the missile tho
120s are more maneuverable yeah
Air density is very very impactful
At high alt 120s can easily get Mach 4 and coast around that speed, at low alt you’ll notice it being way slower and bleeding energy way faster
Going from 10k to 5k and a 90deg turn left is likely not enough to defeat it entirely, but it’ll bleed most of the energy and allow a simple maneuver at the end to dodge it
Range is highly important here for knowing if you’ll dodge it
Missiles are not too powerful :harold:
My pK is normally around .6-.7
Just a high G pull/barrel roll around the missile
6 bracket?
Oh the DLZ
Well uhhh the DLZ is interesting in vtol, and shouldn’t be trusted
All situational, typically in such a way to cause the missile to have to maneuver a lot
But yeah, for range while you *can* hit at 60mi, if they do basically anything they will dodge it
It only works because people fly perfectly straight and high
Ehhhhh not really
Most of what we tested was basically straight flight until pit bull
I think 120s don't lead *that much* so we needed to turn in one direction and hold it
but like, if your seriously defending you need to turn at least 60 degrees and hold it which I don;t think we did
:shut:
Im not a good teacher
oh wait
no you said you
Yeah thats my reply as well
just "uhhhhh idk I just do it"
Immursion
> the distance to the objectives is absurdly far Oh boy just wait till you see MP
They know what your locking I guess
Unguided is pickle
But, I use pickle for JDAMs as well cuz yeah
Might be snake eyes idk
The radar detection is 360
iirc the MWS has some blind spots
Its based on heat so yeah
iv not got a ton of experience fighting AI, don't worry about hte "stall" callout, it really just means your AoA passes a threshold
We doing 1v1s?
:itsfreerealestate:
Nice
vcap is cringe
AP in general is cringe
manual is the way to go
try me
Ill land it within an hour of having it
Ofc
I plan to be in VC
Av hover is only valid bcs you don’t have a second person
In the heli you have no excuse
Don’t
I’m a non-AP elitist
Create public lobby, find new friends
AP is valid for like, long flights to and from places
As I understand it one player can override that right?
Whoever is considering the owner/host
Really?
I thought I saw logic for one person getting priority
Just ban em
Yellow/orange is part of the MWS
The red M is RWR
:itsfreerealestate:
I know im prob gunna eat my words
But
You get a line as well, I think it’s based off range/how accurate the plane knows it
At least I think?
I can’t actually remember either… lol
There will be a very good one soontm
Ierdna is making it
The lowest iv gotten without dying is -50
I wish this was base game, id love a knee board in game
iv got tons of uses for it
Depends, theres a lot of factors that go into if you can radar lock a target
a big part is the targets current RCS, which is a function of their orientation to you
so if they manuver/change directions lock could be lost
things like ground clutter and notching also effect being able to lock
They have a max range of 60 ish miles iirc
they have a 5 minute burn time and fly around mach 1
So 63.9391 nm range
but thats assuming max speed at all times and no manuvers
so, like C said its pushing it
I get 15 ez
Wak
24 kills
Guns only is 24 deaths
Actually maybe bvr is deaths as well?
It’s for the team total
Both for the 26, and the 45 mark enables the viusual laser youu can see with NVGs
:risitas: C learned that at the end of a 30 minute flight
:risitas:
I just made it weewoo
nothing more
When you were coming back the second time i was so scared of accidently shooting you I turned off master arm and made sure not to select you on my TSD
Yeah you can do it IRL, most of the systems are somewhat classified so its hard to get info about them, but an RWR provides a heading and azimuth, two seperate readings of these form two lines out into space, where these two lines intersect thats where your target is
Technically, you can actually just do it with a signel reading using multiple antennas acting as a pair of RWRs
Aint magic, just math
you can also do it with a single ping
given, the aircraft has enough antennas
however you'll notice in game a single ping isnt enough to give velocity
@Sand Druid @cheemical As pings are received, you can imagine a line from your plane through the transmitter, with a single line you have no idea where on the line they are, with multiple the target is at the intersection
Well
yes
the math gets a lot more complex
but you can also use multiple receivers so
lemme see if I can find the program
ewwww why did I write it in js
Oh its actually already setup for a moving target nice
nan
but thats why you have multiple detectors
well we know our own position, and the angle of the line, which gives us an equation for the line and you can do a line-line intersection to solve the point
nan
in the other video they are litterly moving faster :risitas:
Less of a significant fraction of the speed of light
Where it was when it transmitted yeah
lemme actually draw the transmitter
nan
:Think: why
I mean two ad blockers better than one
In vtol the only guided weapon with a range >25nm is the cruise missiles which are a bad choice when shooting tents
Even not counting the gps limitation the range is still <25
It’s 25nm exactly
Tho technically you can hit targets with a HARM at a higher distance, but the arad page isn’t limited to 25
The tender distance isn’t 35km, it’s more
Fly low with radar off most of the time
Flash radar on periodically, and once you do make sure to break LOS and change directions if you don’t spot anything
Try to spot them with your targeting pod
Fly during the night time as you are more equal then
Make large changes in direction frequently
Even a good 45 pilot can get fooled by a predicted track they thought was live
The eots night mode is better in the day, but equal to the tgp at night
That’s not true
In a 45 I rarely turn my radar on, 95% of the time I use only eots
Aim-7 sparrow
No fox 1s in vtol tho
It’s different in the 26
You can’t shoot with only tgp, but you can use it to get yourself into a good spot before you turn your radar on
Yes
There’s no one range
It’s fully dependent on situation, the DLZ gives you a live estimation
cope
Notch, break LoS, lower altitude, lower its energy by manuvering, G-pull
los = line of sight
honestly if you turn fully cold you can beat most missiles, even if they fired from like 10 mi away
Evading missiles is about evading them will still putting yourself in an advantagous position
Notching is turning 90 degrees away from the missile, its also the best place to use chaff
Example of notching
You can see the missile randomly flies behind me onto my chaff bcs I was notching whild dumping chaff
You can, its just kinda difficult and needs different strats
In a 1v1 at night they are equal
Well "equal" is an interesting term, the skill floor of the 45 is lower (higher? I mean its harder to be bad) than the 26
so even a relativly bad 45 pilot can do well
but imo equally skilled good pilots are equal in 45 vs 26 1v1
That being said recently the skill floor for teh 45 was changed so its a bit more difficult to be good with which is good
Ehhh imo 26 better AG
Specifically because when a 45 is in a AG config it can carry next to no AA weapons
where as the 26 in an AG config still has room for plenty of AA
Lack of being able to carry AA and AG at the same time, poor thrust compared to 26, G limit always on
Ehh the 26 can carry a *better* mix of AA AG
Thrust is quite a bit different
ir agms?
Theres no such thing
If you mean AGM-145's thats not IR
and yes you can carry 6, the 26 can also carry 6 AGM-65s on 2 pylons
Ye optical != IR
My normal 26 loadout is  2x AGM-89 (replace with 88s if no boats) 2x AGM-88 3x GBU-38 8x GBU-39 4x AIM-120 6x AIRS-T
thats 4 long range AG weapons and 11 close/med range
Plus 10 AA
It *can*, just very limited compared to the 26
Ehh the TWR loss isn't too high, I think that loadout gives me a .85 TWR at launch? And weapons don't have drag so its whatever
Its def a large step up, but if you know how to use a 26 well the step isn't soo large to make the 26 pointless
the 26 can carry 32 bombs, I don't think the 45 needs a reduction :risitas:
:thonkery: I just stan'ed the 26 for the last 10 minutes
nan
:Think: its either I spend 20 minutes setting up and recording the burn time of a 120, or I spend 2 seconds to read a number, dosn't matter either way
Modding is not breaking the game :bruh:
Theres a reason why the wiki has so many mistakes, its because they look at the game and think they see one thing where actually it works a different way
Besides the like what, burn time of a missile dosn't mean anything
The only numbers iv really looked at in game are radar related bcs I was making a website related to it
Yeah would be nice, iv mentioned to the wiki owner that he could make something like that
iv never hidden anything Iv learned in game unless it was unreleased for that exact reason
I think the info/knowledge should be avalible to all, and will gladly tell anyone anything they want to know
The numbers are fairly meaningless, knowing how long a missile will burn for dosnt exactly help
I don't even know the numbers
Radar is a bit different, but me and C have been very open about sharing the RCS diagrams we have made
Ehhhh not really
missile range is very very complex
all my knowledge about how far missiles can fly is from experience
an AIM-120 has a burn time of 18 seconds (just checked) but knowing that is meaningless
same is true about learning things in game
RCS is too complex/situational anyways, theres a number of different factors that go into if you'll be detected or not
But it could have been done, and could have been kept private, instead things have been shared
the intention was to make a tool that lets people learn about the in game radar because its so complex
which I never finished for a number of reasons
but thats why I was making it
How am I suposed to mod without seeing the values
people will always be making mods, and be decompiling the game to learn about it, isnt it better for that knowledge to be shared rather than horded and used by a select few as an advantage
Iv managed to find two *very significant* bugs due to analyzing the game, which would still be in if I hadnt
even knowing detection ranges you can't really skirt around the edges, me and C are still constantly supprised/caught off guard by detection ranges in game despite the analysis we have done
thats fair
But none of the info found via decompiling was impossible to find in game
you *could* have found it in game, it just would have been tedious
Baha himself shared teh 45's RCS anyways
oh
well then good
the RCS values were gained by a mod
not by decompiling
yeah
thats how they were exported as data
Radar code yes, but the visualizations were different
Ask @C-137 how he did it, he dosn't have a program or anything hes just graphing values using desmos with teh RCS values that were exported with a mod
Oh close enough
So thats valid tho? It was a mod, not decompiling the game
Well to make a mod you *have* to decompile the game but
Even then your RCS changes *soo much* as you manuver and what not
There are three methods, all with teh same results - decompiling for values - modding for values - testing for values All give teh same result but only modding and testing is OK?
What about the sam circle mod
that does the same, shows the range of every radar perfectly
Yeah but it lets you learn the ranages off all SAM sites
Issue is modders will inevitably see the internal values just while working on mods
So its somehow OK for modders to see these values but other people not to?
So whats the issue then? Why do you dislike modders/decompilers?
Maybe "dislike" is the wrong word, but saying you don't respect them/me is just as hurtful
> when people learn information that is otherwise behind an NDA Its litterly a file called "multicrew" that I saw while scrolling down a list, what did you expect
its not hidden or obsucred at all
>  or mod their version information What C did was dumb yes and he got yelled at it for it
You *have to* to mod the game
yes
Modding the game is something baha supports and is fine with, I have no idea what the issue is
nan
Bcs your on p98
Update your game and it’ll fix
:stonks:
Why would you need to?
you eject
yellow handle between your legs
Part of the ejection sequence is explosively jettisoning the canopy
The f45 dosnt have radar boresight mode
There are no disadvantages of the AIRST compared to the AIM9
^
DLZ lies, it’s fairly good when fighting AI
But in general just experiment, try things, eventually you’ll get a pretty good feel for the performance of the missiles
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/343253364081033226/927119780530520094
MAD-4s arent nearly as scary as the MC
^
I am confident in my ability to dodge a mad4
if a MC locks me I run and dive instantly
I don't think anything in VTOL will launch beyond visual range
I don't believe iv ever been launched beyond 25nm
Or maybe right around there
you can see targets at 30nm so maybe around there
I don't personally experience that, visual range 25nm I create a GPS, fire, then turn cold
they do fire right as I fire, but if you turn straight cold instantly youll break the radar lock iirc
LOAL yeah
Its becomeing more and more prevelent in modern warfare with advances in datalink
Exactly LOAL, I mean it would be silly to launch if you had no idea if an aircraft was coming but
LOAL is any time your missile locks on after launch, including when you don't know where the target is yet
No one CAPs in navel strike mission yeah
it would be too easy if people did
ok well very few ppl do
Only weapon with LOAL in VTOL is the AGM-145
And AIM-120D's if you know what your doing
Imo for the 26 mission, 4 person cap makes sense
2 dedicated CAP for each SEAD aircraft
My normal loadout can take out 3/4 objectives on a single load for that mission so don't need that much sead
Exactly, which is why you have two people on SEAD
Yeah I typically still carry 4 120s and 6 AIRST's on that loadout
which could be 10 AGM-65's if I didnt have to worry about aircraft
My typical route is  Shore side DS radars -> MAD 4 radars -> Bay MC's and sam site -> bunkers -> mid island SAM -> airfield MAD-4 -> assassination -> bay mine layers -> RTB
Yeah normally :risitas:
I never hit the north west MAD-4
Theres zero reason to enter its threat range
Nah its just a bit out of range
Maybe ill try a solo run again today
I kinda wanna get a zero death solo run
if you look at the cover it has cut out notches/slits in it to let the switch pass through, its meant so its protected in either the on or off modes
nah its got an actual spot
nan
> And are there SAM sites that can shoot either one down? Afaik if a SAM site has the ability to shoot down one, it can shoot down both, but 161s tend to be a bit easier to hit due to their speed > And do either one need lock all the way to the target or are they fire and forget?  145 is LOAL/FAF, 161 is GPS, so both are FAF
161s are far heavier, more expensive, and you can carry fewer
however, its got a far far higher range
yes
the bomb inherrits your speed on release
Thats what it does yeah
wuh I use trim all the time, its great
If you trim correctly you can take your hands off the controls and fly straight and level
if your changing Collective/cyclic your not flying straight and level
As you change collective you have to counter torque, its just a heli thats what happens, but with propper trim its barely a touch
TADS is a slightly upgrade EOTS
but I do tend to change my trim quite a bit, theres a reason why its directly on the cyclic so easily assesible
On all VTOL aircraft, `MARK` enables the visible laser that you can see with NVGs
nah its optional
its purely visual only
Ye, NVGs are the same as the other aircraft
Yeah it really is a sight to behold for several helis to be pointing lasers at different targets at night
are you looking at the sun/moon?
Ohh that
Nah full-screen NVG is cringe
Yeah I think I have those off, but I enjoy the challenges of night operations with small fov NVGs
Tbh I mostly use the TGP/EOTS/TADS rather than NVGs which now I cant do bcs my gunner is using it lol
I fly without NVGs until I get close to terrain
if you are doing very low level/diving up and down around ravines and vallys its very helpful
Notching is more effective than the other vics due to low speed, low alt, and high manuverability
Manuvering helps quite a bit
Yeah me too :Agony:
Its a bad habbit
Dump flares -> pull all the way back on the stick -> reduce throttle to zero
Then remember im in a helicopter and thats a very bad idea
6-7 miles iirc
You can lock on you just need a high enough rcs
Somewhat, gunner has the ability to take their hands off and press more than the pilot
Basically a metric of how well the radar can see the target
Well kinda, I’m using the term incorrectly here
RCS is how radar reflective something is
However some things reduce the strength of the return/make it harder to lock
To some extent that’s because the AA radars are simpler and they have way higher range
It’s wayyyyyyyyyy harder to lock something on the ground than in the air, and the SAM radar is like twice the size of your aircraft
You had a heli at 25k ft?
Oh
What’s that in miles
Lack of lock ability then is likely just due to what your orientation to the target is
RCS changes depending on which way you are looking at the target
Noooo
Not from your aircraft
I mean compared to the radar system
@C-137 gimme numbers
I guess I could just hand write them but
Oh
Hm
The remote model likely has RCS values as well
Think of it like a return strength
No it still helps, that graph is messy lemme grab one for a VTOL aircraft
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/319916002702000129/920038760794693642/unknown.png
F-45 RCS vs F/A-26b RCS
Where you can imagine the aircraft is in the middile there facing directly forward
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/343253364081033226/914753496744603688/unknown.png
Fighter vs prop aircraft
The effects of notching are far greater than the increase in RCS
What Piggy said
Also once a target has locked you to launch a missile in the head on orientation
you turning does nothing as your already below your min RCS range
Not *weapons range* per say
But if you are flying directly at a target, and get locked then it dosnt matter what your RCS is, they have already locked you in your stealthiest direction
it can be as low as like 5nm
oh yeah its gigantic
like on the magnitude of 200x higher than the front
Yeah in part due to low ranges involved
Most of the time we lock people we are locking people at the very edge of our range and ability to do so
IRL the max range of radars is hundreds of miles so a target 60nm away will be an easy lock
No set ranges, its all about situation target range, aspect, altitude, ground etc etc
Well those are bad aircraft
I mean good ones like F-15's
Not "overwhelm" but those bits wayyyyyy increases the aircrafts RCS
They are kinda like radar retroreflectors
They intentionally ruin the stealth of the aircraft
noo its so that other countries cant learn about its radar returns
this way no one knows just *how* stealthy it is, or if there are specific frequencies that are better or what tactics are better and worse for it etc etc
Practice and react less than you think you need to
Don’t use autopilots they teach bad habits
With the exception of speed AP
Speed AP is good so you can focus on latteral position first
Once you get that down start working on speed
Not directly no
if you point the TGP at the ARAD diamond then you can
25nm yeah
Cope
Even the longest range SAM dosnt engage >25nm so
MAD-4 wont fire until <25nm
For trim you just push the trim in the direction you are holding until your holding center
Its your acceleration vector
thats your velocity vector
?
It has an ADI
Being high is death most of the time
A bit but not significant
Being high can be fine if you only launch a single missile then dive instantly, but that assumes you spot incoming missiles
I only recommend it at the start of the match, or after a team wipe
But even then it’s risky
If you fail to spot the incoming missile your kinda fucked
The missile still pitbulls
That’s not what pitbull is
Pitbull refers to when a missile switches to its internal radar and starts guiding itself
No it’s still required
That’s pre-terminal, pitbull is at terminal phase
The fix is trim
https://airplaneacademy.com/aircraft-trim-explained-with-pictures/
You have to have a target locked
you'll want to maintain some airspeed imo otherwise you wont understand some of the things that happen while you are moving
Just look at something on the HUD, try to work out what it does, if you dunno just ask in discord
Even the heaviest load isnt *that* heavy, and tbh iv never lowered fuel load as your always carrying less than 1000L
but if you find yourself stuggling feel free to lower it
theres no wrong way to practice, arguably the heavier you are the better the practice is but its subjective
tbh the AH-94 hud and the F/A-26b huds are very very different
no
sadly
You select the targets the same way you do with the AA radar
That would've been my advice as well
theres a reason I don't offer to teach people
What about left?
Left is juts as good as right
In what what?
passive = scanning
fast = locked
additional = radar guided missile in close proximity
There will be symbols with it as well
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Radar_Warning_Receiver_(RWR)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr6ZoRh0P8Y This is a great demo
first the ping which is it scanning, then it locks and gets the circle around it
then you see the red M appear and the warning sounds more urgent
Yellow is MWS launch dectection
two orange are MWS missile proximity detection
MWS works off IR/heat
not strictly true, closer just means higher signal strength
A radar that puts out more power will appear closer than a weak one, even at the same distance
However ofc as a target gets closer the recieved signal strength increases so there is a strong coroloation with distance
Its also non-linear on the RWR, so most targets will appear somewhere on the outer ring and only very close/strong radars will appear closer
Its purely signal strength in vtol vr
ModuleRWR + DashRWR
Likely the code name for the ARAD page
You also have to be holding trigger
Combat collective trigger + CMS button
TDAC
Well it’s not spelt like that but it sounds like that
TEDAC maybe?
Yeah the TEDAC
Might have yeah
I have zero idea what it stands for
max advised? Higher is better, no need to set a max
Depends on your mission and play style
iv done things with a 0.3 twr before
Max weight + single engine on the F/A-26b
Annoyingly the game won't actually let you do full max weight, its too expensive for even the free flight modes
I mean still like 0.6, I legit just had to take a few lieters less of gas
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/444150937079250945/925635281921638440/unknown.png
I mean the stall thing is easy to do at low speeds, its what happens when the heli decides it wants to be up side down
I dunno what the effects of transonic forces are in vtol
Wait with the mission editor can I spawn a heli at 900 knots?
AP->Nav->take a nap
Ima try this after I eat dinner lmao
Ok but
thats a skill issue
That mission really shouldnt take that long lol
This video being a year old means it’s results are completely inaccurate
There used to be a very major bug with RCS that has sense been fixed
Well yeah if you try to just fly at a 45 that has better weapons, sensors, and stealth then your going to die, but the 26 has some strats it can use
It hurts it but dosnt fuck it
Why would 90 be the stealthiest?
And the radar can see much more of the body of the aircraft
Yeah Doppler and what not isn’t included in these graphs
I have a simulation that does include it that I can pull up in a bit
^
These are pulse-Doppler radar, even a perfect notch you’ll still be detectable
It helps chaff out at least
The more you notch the better chaff works
:bonkcat:
It’s better than you having LPI
Navel strike mission be like
Sometimes when my entire team is who knows where I’ll be super accurate with my coms just so they know how useless they are being
Whats the AH-94d?
Is it a new DLC being released?
no?
Thats the AH-94
no suffix
Comon man its just a joke
Plus so many people call like the F-45 the F-35 and what not and then they complain like "oh the F-35 can do this why cant it do it in vtol" so gotta remind people the names
To explain a bit, the "RWR" display actually shows two independent systems that both display over each other on that screen they are: **RWR - Radar warning receiver**, displays any radar energy that passes over your plane (scanning or locking), the first occasional pinging you hear is their radar scan passing over your aircraft as it scans the sky, the continous tone is when the target locks you, that is, the radar energy is being constantly sent at you. Finally you have the active radar homing warning, which is a more urgent tone and the target will be denoted with a red "M" on the RWR.   **MWS - Missile warning system**, displays nearby missiles, it does this by looking for the thermal signature of missile rocket motors. It has two warnings, "launch warning" when the initial kick/thrust of a missile is detected, or the "missile warning". Launch warning is a yellow semi-circle on the outer ring of the RWR display, and missile warning is the two orange lines that shows more precisly where a nearby missile is. The RWR is 100% consistant and will never miss something, where the MWS can be very inconsistant due to blindspots and the missiles having cooled down
Correct, all you see on the RWR part of the RWR is active radars, the AIM-120's don't enable their internal radar until they are in close proximity to a target and switch to active-radar guided
Depending on the situation the MWS might pick up the missile before it switches to its internal radar
> I'm surprised when heading for a target that seems to be relatively slow and about 5nm off, being convinced that they don't even know I'm there (flying low and fast), then I see a burning fume right next to them and think it can't possibly be a missile heading for me, RWR is silent. And when I finally get the warning, it's almost too late to evade. In the same way you fire on targets using datalink (or any other valid track-creating source) they may be doing the same, which will guide the missile in without a warning
An AIM-120D isn't *radar guided* in the preterminal phase, its just *guided*, the missile could care less how the data is generated its all just data, so it could be EOTS, Visual, Radar, or datalink
Its best to do it early, but notching/chaff can def work even after pitbull
:risitas: I knew you would say something shenan
chopper has like zero thermal output so
Just gotta get closer to the target then
nan
> Flairs Flairs only work on IR missiles
Notch, break LoS, chaff, fly away from the missile, get lower down, try to dive it into terrain, lower its energy so you can make a last-moment dodge
Well I mean the F-45 *can* optically guide an AIM-120 so
Against good players I have more IR missile kills than AIM-120 kills, they are def nothing to sleep on
Its just you need to be in specific situations to use them
But fighting good players ends in a merge quite a bit of the time
or a point blank 120
I think so?
Either IR or just point blank 120s I dunno
I tend to preflare quite a bit so
The only HARMs in game are AG not AA
technically all weapons work on aircraft
its just about what the chance of getting a hit is
even the sidearm is terrible at hitting aircraft, its meant as an AG role
Ye you can even use AIM-120s to shoot down incomming missiles
Basically any weapon can be used to kill anything, including weapons
Iv gotten gun kills on an AGM thats about to hit me
the 88 is direct, the 188 is top down
nan
:bigbrain:
> should work in a dogfight they don't lead targets at all, and due to how a radar works it only gets updates infrequently
so, the chance of hit is very very low
they would have to lock the missile
yeah
Me watching my HARM go pitbull
if they lock onto it after you launch it should work
even then tho it wont lead so
:kek:
God iv been flying the heli for basically a week straight and now I feel like I can't even fly in a straight line in a BVR fight
Back when it was just the MP mod I used to just fight the same person over and over and over again getting my ass kicked every time until I was able to hold my own
It worked pretty well for 1v1's or 2v2's
Or just free flight
anything other than that was uhhhhhh
bit of a gable
Theres already like 5 people planning on making desert storm :risitas:
I just really want truly difficult missions tbh
Urban Liberation is pretty good in that front
but, its really more long than difficult
I want missions that are effectivly impossible without more players
CAW-8 gets large groups pretty reliably so I bet we could get something going
Its the vtol server/squadran/group thing im in
If you kill the MAD-4s early you don't even have to think about the GAV-25s, and if you use the mountains on the right you can get within like 3-4 mi of the boats
You can also radar peak over the mountain and never even have a direct line of sight to the target
Yeah would be nice
This is why reading the briefing is important
You can radar peak solo if you need to take TADS from your gunner for a minute
When I’m doing something complex/time sensitive and I’m with a newer gunner I’ll sometimes take the TADS to do it myself
Not if the gunner has SOI
First thing I tell my gunners is that the slave button is their friend
I tend to have NAV and radar up when piloting and I’ll look anything important
Iv seen one try to shoot me exactly once and it missed
Isn’t the callout for JDAMs technically supposed to be snakeeyes?
Fuck da AI you don’t need em
:risitas:
I mean most people don't even realize what their callsign is even if you used it
nan
The guy that said "who tf is 1-6" *was 1-6*
thats good
Likely bug but baha knows about it https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/929605701846851614
I wish in AA mode it wasnt like that
be detected not only by F-45s infront of you but behind you as well!
Patched on PT
>     - Fixed: TEDAC right stick couldn't control SOI screens unless they were on the center MFD
true lmao
prob at least 20 nm
5k ish?
7700, just checked
thats expected due to RCS
As you view targets from different angles the detectability changes
400
yeah
its uh
thats why you can only see ASF-30s at like 5 nm range
and the F-45 is just the word "no" painted on your radar display
It *can* lock onto infantry
just a person is tiny and isnt very reflective so you have to be very close and at the correct angle
enable trig uncage -> hold trigger -> aim circle over mountain -> press the fire button
Go to equip, press on one of the 145s, and switch “manual” to “trig uncage”
In vtol the zero position of the collective is actually negative and will force you downwards
A pylon is the term for the mounting point of weapons
It can move to give better firing situations
Better firing situations
Such as being able to fire over a mountain
Or give better range to a missile
Or in the case or say, hydras, you have to worry less about your vertical alignment
You can manually control it, or set it to auto
Auto tends to be pretty good, sometimes I just set it to max up and call it good
Wdym?
Fly backwards? You just pull the cyclic back and manage your yaw to keep it backwards
The top down velocity indicator is great for that
Oh
Yeah
Just fly fast enough and you can invert due to negative collective
The 94 is wayyyyy more forgiving than other aircraft
It weighs so little and can go from zero thrust to 100% instantly
Ye
It starts at the true zero position
Watching the video, what I see: - hes not very fast (100 knots) and slowing quickly, which means theres lots of aero drag with the manuver hes doing - hes already rolled a bit, and is yawing into the roll (right), despite having a cyclic input to the left, while his velocity is also to the left, so hes swinging the tail more into the airstream (explains the drag). At this point the nose is far from level/being alined with velocity and getting worse due to how hes pushing the aircraft - He continues to hold inputs as the aircraft rolls to the left (due to cyclic input) - yaw is pushed even farther to the right, pilot has over-rolled left just a bit, and way over compensates to the right, but keeps right YAW input in - right yaw + right cyclic + slow speed (80 knots now) + stall blade stall due to the above leads to uncontrolled roll
For the first inversion ^
The second inversion is much the same, hes yawing extremely hard, causing the airflow to want to push over the aircraft,  plus slow speed
I mean just look at the yaw input, hes trying to do a turn using nothing but yaw
ye
and hes almost 90 degrees off his velocity vector
Which, at 90 knots, is very fast to be going sideways
And yeah he failed to lower the collective
which is why you hear is rotor RPM drop like it does
Ikr I just read it :risitas:
the TSD is just a display of information it gets from a bunch of different sources
Yeah itll predict targets location based off last know values
Yeah
except the internal radars of 120s are a little bit magic in that they don't turn on once they reach a proximity to the target, rather they are *always* on looking for a target (kinda)
Basically the moment the 120 can see the target it will lock it
IRL, yes
in VTOL, it dosnt matter
it will only lock the specific thing it was launched at
yeah
nan
Indeed
He deserved it tho
Tbf I launched here
With a good amount of seperation
In my defense
He tried to steal my kill
Its quite fun
Makes hovering a hell of a lot harder
Especially when you want to hover-strafe
Yeah no VRS

Likely retreating blade stall
I don't have a list at least
Well
Its got induced flow
I know that much from decompiling
and ofc blade stall as teh rotors are literally wings like the other aircraft have which is neat
Flow caused by the air being pushed downwards
I barely understand it so
Trim is useful but very optional if you know what your doing
?
No? If you know what your doing then you can easily fly without it
You can just counter yourself
trim isnt somehow magic, its just a constant control input
you can provide that constant control input yourself
I don't have thumbsticks
They *can*
Its just an option
I can trim if I need be
I can also fly just fine without trim
Ok well im not talking about IRL
Im talking about VTOL VR :risitas:
Yaw trim is done while holding the flight collective
Real pilots say trim is not needed in vtol :shrug:
nan
nan
Pipekr is an AH-64 pilot lol
Like I said, trim isnt magic, its just a constant control input
what
lmao
>provides evidence >"Nah don't believe you"
Want me to fly around without trim just to prove it?
:angery:
It is with all aircraft (except for AH-94 I think cuz bug) by pressing `SEND` on the GPS page
Fox 4 means guns
Yes?
It litterly does
Even the AI will sometimes say that
Well show me the patchnote saying nuclear missiles were added to vtol :thonkery:
Its got higher maneuverability
In order from worst to best, AIM-92, AIM-9, AIM-9+, AIRS-T
nah its worse
Iv missed *plenty* of shots
Theres only a single value about the AIM-9+ thats better than the AIRS-T
Max Torque Speed
Its about 16% higher, but, the AIRS-T hits its max torque like twice as fast so
Also p sure the AIM-9+ can't even use its max tourque due to AoA limitations
neither
its complicated
TLDR, AIRS-T better in every possible regard
more like a limitor to the max theoretical force the fins could produce
eh?
Quite a few differences actually
They are close in performance
but not the same
Try hovering with your HUD off, I found that was great for practice
For a hover? You shouldn't be moving at all
I use side stick personally
Depends on the situation, it can feel like that. Part of the reason I recommended flying no HUD is it dosn't matter where the stick is, if thats forward or backward, and all the HUD symbiology while useful can be over-bearing and anti-helpful when trying to learn, all that matters is if the aircraft is where you want it to be, and if its not, you have to move the stick collective and rudder to make it so
Strafing gets very difficult the faster you do it, stay under 30 knots when trying to do a pure strafe while practicing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BHjixMJeKo
Watch the first few seconds of this ^
Im going to list criticisms as I see them
Text size is huge, 17
Arial is a bad font and dosnt look good
> Pilot is also a commanding crew member - he is the one giving orders. This is incorrect
The gunner is the one giving orders
nan
> This helicopter has standard flight controls. Helicopter is rather unstable in tight low-speed turns. The heli is only unstable if you use it incorrectly, its like saying the F-45 is unstable when you put it into a flatspin
> Cyclic is used to control pitch, yaw and roll Only true when theres no rudder peddles
> Thrust lever is used to control power produced by turbines Thrust lever *limits* the power produced, but the govenor system is what actually controls it
Well yeah,  give a bunch of people with no idea what they are doing in a helicopter the controls and your going to get a lot of crash
The choice of what to list here seems odd, why list some but not others?
The startup checklist would cause an engine failure
Yeah
Theres no waiting period between left and right engine start
Listing TADS MARK, but not other paramaters like TADS MODE or RADAR elevation is odd, and inconsistant
noo :Agony:
How to die in one easy step
WSO has two MFDs, and a TEDAC
> intended to be used as the main targeting screen for TADS Or NAV or RADAR depending on situation, its not limited to any one, its set as the gunner chooses
> WSO is expected to take over engine restart Engine restart is not a thing in VTOL, once its lost its gone
Engine failure checklist is uh
interesting
> Collective - 0% (immediately) No, even for an auto-rotate going to 0% instantly is not the play depending on altitude, RPM, and airspeed
> MASTER CAUTION - RESET Master caution is the *last* step of this process, no need to clear it early, it does nothing but flash
> CONTACT FRIENDLY UNICOM In flight there is the idea of "aviate, navigate, communicate" communication is the last step in this priority chain
> APU - ON IF ABLE APU is uneeded in single engine failure
> Left Engine Start - ON IF ABLE > Right Engine Start - ON IF ABLE Engine restart is impossible, also if you run both starters then youll have an issue
> IF ENGINE RPM STABLE: LAND IMMEDIATELY, APU - OFF Landing in enemy territory will get you killed,  only land immediantly if you have dual engine failure
> Attitude - STABILIZE What does this mean? Level out?
Why would an engine failure cause spinning?
Attitude tends to refer to the pitch anyways, if you manage to get a tail over head spin then good luck
Then on the tail structure failure > Collective - 0% > MASTER CAUTION - RESET If you have a total tail loss, good luck, your dead. If you only loose the anti-torque then going collective zero is bad, lowering collective a bit is good but you need to get speed quickly
> When ALT < 150 FT AGL: Collective UP, land Yeah uh thats how you die
You need to maintain airspeed forward, while being carful on the collective
Oh I just noticed therse a Single Engine Failure checklist specifically
The single engine checklist should be listed before the dual one
and the dual engine checklist should mention its for duel engine
You could nose strike and loose control
https://youtu.be/fCIg_9dvnmU?t=148
timestamped
I mean, basically what im doing in that video :risitas:
Its far quicker to touch down and skid to slow down then to try to J turn
> IF ENGINE FAILS TO START - Continue engine will always fail to start
it works best on non-concrete surfaces
Also this likely needs to be re-named, imo its not a manual its a startup and checklists document
Really? I thought the missiles we so fast that delaying launch would always mean yours hit second
Honestly BVR in vtol is al about terrain
That would be a fun graph to make, at a given altitude where is the best point to launch to minimize flight time
That just pushes the issue out imo
What
Even low altitude a 120c has dozens of miles of range
Are you confusing aim-9 values for aim-120 values?
Imo even with longer radar ranges that would still happen, rather I think the AIM-120 should have much lower maneuverability for the boost phase
Rn even shooting a 120 90 degrees off boresight barely hurts its performance
Lmao
Most of the missile trading I do with people is due to point blank 120s
And I can’t blame em, they are just too good close in
The real performance is likely a lot higher, the data shows a missile maintaining a set altitude which isn’t what you would do for a normal flight profile
Yeah
If you look at the graphs the missiles are struggling to keep their speed due to increasing AoA
A loft would mean they can keep a very low aoa as they approach the target as they can initially fly up and desend
A bit, not much
nan
Fun fact, thats the first video I ever posted to this discord
no
Only air to air missiles are good for air to air
I mean you can
its possible to hit
ARAD missiles are not air to air
No
they are anti-ground
yeah you *can* they just suck at it
same way you can fire a PGM at an air target
laser or ballista would also give MWS btw
60 nm isnt long enough range?
Missile warning system
you can see something at 60 miles?
?
TGP max range is 25 nm lock on slightly higher visual, no where near 60 nm so good luck with that
More is better to an extent, the more you notch the better
chaff can't actually break locks
its just the beaming thats doing that
It *should* break the lock imo
but, the way its implemented it dosnt
Instead it confuses the radar into thinking your somewhere your not and the missile will curve away from you
nan
Maybe I was saying it *should* break locks?
Rn, it dosn't, it has that effect on the missile ^
you already can
Kinda
I used to have this issue, what helped me is rather than trying to touch down, I think about just letting the aircraft fall onto the wires, and the hook is wayyy farther back then you think, so you need to land much farther than expected
Yeah lmao POINT is great for getting peoples attention
More than once iv only had AIM-9s and wanted to get close to someone but they were just ignoring me
Go to point mode and its a lot harder for them to ignore you lmao
Ikr lmao
Sneaking up on people is great, issue is when they are in a 26 they just fly away
They use a laser that we can’t see due to the spectrum
It’s also how it gets range
They don't see the spectrum that the laser is in
Cone size dosnt actually change how well you can hold locks
All it does it change scan angle
Not if the target is tws’ed
TWS tracks update at constant rate that is unaffected by scam angle or number of tracks
If anything, it’s placebo
TWS tracks and scan angle effect only the *scan* rate
TWS tracks and lock ability are still the same
Useful if you want to not expose yourself to an aircrafts allies
If that refers to how more lift is generated on one side vs the other due to airspeed, yes
Interesting, ground effect *is* simulated, but, I’m not sure if it’s effect is high enough to be noticeable
I feel like iv noticed it while landing on a building, where going over the edge requires a bit more collective, but it may have been placebo
you can in #vtolvr_tv
:typingdots:  **C-137** is typing...
It looks identical
its just
a bit dimmer
well uh
make me a new emoji then
skill issue
Yeah 39s are great, I used to always carry mavrics but 39s are nice due to how many you can carry
Yeah moving targets are the issue
You can once you are in head tracked mode
You can switch to head mode without taking your hands off the controllers
Press down and hold
On the joystick/touchpad you use to slew around
If you press the HMD button you can use head mode without the overlay
Alternatively, it’s a multicrew aircraft for a reason
Likely because not all controllers have it
If your flying solo you can hop into the front seat
I found this https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1858297782722777977/7D2DA78477E66F2841C987EAF47ECA5ADF974BCB/
Don't know, looks like its pointing at the birds eye view velocity indicator?
This vertical line?
Thats the top-down velocity indicator
No idea what its offical name is but
Thats the acceleration vector
Baha just needs to fix the bug that makes missiles go dumb randomlly
When a F/A-26b takes at *least* two missiles to kill, and theres a bug meaning they will go dumb randomly you'll be using an average of 3 missiles per target against even unskilled players
Lmao
I found this pretty neat video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je4dYwtFwWc
its a magnet for the velocity vector
Sadly no, questions have been banned in this channel
channel description needs to be fixed
But yeah no feel free to ask any questions in here
yes
yes it is
do not do
yes
get in close, bait shots you can easily dodge
shoot down incomming missiles with AIRS-Ts
alyways assume there is a 45 stalking you
assume anywhere you point your radar a missile is coming from
If the seaker head should automatically slave to the target, or if you have to hold the trigger
Non-agile weapons work too
but, they just require being more head on to the missile
Last I did it it was with a 45
I did get a lock tho so wasnt just TSD/DAS
I really gotta categorize my videos
I have 214 vtol clips so trying to find a specific one is hard
nan
I’m not a scam :crycat:
Whos the real looser here
nan
There I zoomed in on the important part
Rocket motors are quite hot, even after burning out
And modern IR sensors are insanely sensitive, I wouldnt be suprised if its possible
but tbh the issue is actually seeing the missile coming
in vtol we get a nice icon directly over it
The missile datalink provides pitbull status, as well as TTI
as well as the missiles location at all times
*however* the missile datalink will not report the location of a target
IR weapons have zero datalink
> The TSD can display contacts (aircraft or weapons) acquired from: To be a bit more clear here, the TSD reports information from the following sources:  Radar EOTS RWR Optical/DAS Datalink  Datalink can be any of the above, just from someone else
Plus GPS technically but that dosn't create a track file so im not counting it
He did a while ago
Basically immediately after you reported it lol
The radar absorbent material dosnt however the engine itself has anti-IR material
Im p sure that override value is used to manually lower/increase RCS for balence/reasonableness, so the 45 has a lower RCS than its shape would give naturally
Yes, espeically as you have only one engine
Its really due to only having one engine
its basically an IR camera
so optical but in the IR spectrum
^
I mean its more that against an optical camera lowering your IR sig dosnt matter
as its not targeting "hot thing" its targeting "hot shape with not hot next to it"
The EOTS *is* IR track
its just not IRST
no I said shadow was wrong :defaultdance:
IR just means infrared, an IR camera is still IR
If you specifically mean IRST, no, theres no such system in game (thank god)
Thats how TGPs/point track work
they use differences in color (aka heat) to track/lock targets
I mean... no?
I guess technically yes but thats how all targeting pods work IRL
Its just called a point track
No
if they are very close (sub 5 mi) then the DAS/optical system will detect them tho
However the ability to track them comes from their heat, but not because they are hot, because there is *contrast* of some kind in any spectrum. This is why, like shadow says, you can also optically track a target using the COLOR mode of the TGP
It just cares that there is contrast in the energy being sent, which in the case of COLOR mode, that energy happens to be in frequency that we can see
In practice, VTOL dosn't care about any of that
all you need is a valid unit with a large enough size within the FOV of the camera to lock it, then the track will be perfect no matter the contrast so as long as the system can gimble to watch the target
are you starting both engines at teh same time?
you'll have to post a video
only the 26 has an E bracket
The 45 dosn't have one
nan
It didn't...
I just checked the game objects, the F/A-26b has an `EBracket` object the 45 dosn't
Price
Other than that no
PGMs require laser guidence and afaik they have a lower ripple rate and you can carry less of them
the inner pylons of the 94 can carry 57
Yeah lmao
ye
np
145s :risitas:
I rarely carry PGMs or hydras
If I were to carry, id choose PGMs
Unless I had a very specific reason to need hydras
Yeah in general anything the hydra can do the gun can do better
Urban Liberation?
1 each
They likely intersept the glide bombs, or your targeting a bad spot
The objective is *SEAD* not kill
With a 145 just target the primary radar and you'll finish the objective
lel
It takes 2-3 to sink I think
depends where you hit ofc
https://youtu.be/ID_mhWNILTw?t=362
Slave targeting pod to something, get out of LoS/use radar to start it out of LoS, rotate hardpoint upwards (optional but good), hold trigger, aim circle above mountain, fire
you have trig uncage enabled right?
You should see it unless you are still in line of sight, id have to see a video to know why its not working
Im pretty sure you have to be in DLZ range
f45 is identical to the 94 when it comes to the agm145s
Are you sure they weren’t just in the upper part of the DLZ?
Hmm I’ll have to test once I get home
10mi is within the range of what you can do in the heli, LOaL dosnt really change the performance, but yeah I dunno if you can LOAL at that range
4km
Turning off your engines only works if its an IR missile
Well
it helps
it dosn't always work
Chaff is far more effective when notching
Turning at the last minute is only good if you've already blead a lot of the missiles energy
You'll want to notch/break away before
and try your hardest to break line of sight
Diving it into the occean is also good
you can, I don't recommend it
it should be a last resort if you do it
When a heat seaker is fired?
Cut engines, drop some flares, and pull away from the missile
you don't have to manuver that hard against IR missiles
ARAD missiles are anti-ground
depends on the aircraft/mission
you could clip your wing and survive
don't fight enemy air
you can hit buildings at mach1
theres a few causes, normally its due to putting the aircraft under too much stress/load, if you lower collective like piggy said itll fix
There’s no “typical” or average, it’s all about what you are trying to do
When I’m just trying to get somewhere, I keep it at 100%
They aren’t fire and forget, but, it dosnt matter where the data source is as long as there is a valid track file
So an awacs can provide the data source as long as it can see the target
I mean you can do that in a 26 as well
But yes as long as you have a track file
And track files will predict while not being live updated, which means you can loose tracking for a bit then reaquire
the F-45 works off the idea of "track files" which is any of the targets you see on the TSD
It dosn't matter what source provides the data for the track file
I mean the plane tries its best
it just gets a lil bit confused sometimes
You don't line up the target with the circle, a marker on the HUD will come into the circle once you can fire
lemme find a video
nan
nan
These icons are what need to be in the circle
you can pull negative G in the heli
I dunno if it limits bomb drop tho
There’s no vanilla tacview
That what I meant but I am not good at English
:stonks:
I’m never releasing a mod just out of spite
when you need more fuel, or when you want to be able to quickly loose weight
For many missions ill carry ext tanks then jetison them once I get into combat
lets me set exactly how much fuel I want when combat starts, while still being able to AB to get AO
Onboard guidance and terrain avoidance but it’ll hit the GPS target you give it, flies about Mach 1 for 5 minutes, so roughly 60nm
Well 145s don’t have auto homing like that so I’m not 100% sure what you mean
It’ll hit the GPS point as exactly as it can, no other onboard sensors
Once it’s been fired it cannot be readjusted no
> can't really be dodged in open air as such Its a game of energy, once you bleed their energy its trivial to beat even in open air
Chaff can also help quite a bit
Chaff works both for lowering a missiles energy as well as completly evading it
Notching is very powerful
chaff and notching works best when used together, cranking is what you want to do if your actvily trying to shoot back
switching directions while cranking helps as it forces it to turn more
Notching dosn't actually matter if the motor is burning or not, notching is a radar evasion tequnique primarily
This was notching + chaff to kill the first missile which was fired just a few miles from me
Chaff works very differently then flares, and its less luck than people expect. Once you get practice you can increase the chance of it working tremendously
The last incoming was IR
He fired 4 missiles, 3 of which were at me. First two were radar, last two were IR
Nah that was Shenanigans he knows how chaff/notching works 😄
Context clues are required to know, how close is the enemy, are you being locked by someone, is there a red M on your RWR
Even now im sometimes caught off guard because I miss-classified a missile
knowing what type of missile was launched at you is extremly important and when you get it wrong you die :risitas:
"TSD datalink is only within your "wing" or unit group, unless it's an AWACS. So there's some inconsistency with the NAV map." - baha
Maybe those ground units don't count as part of your wing
Primarily because it’s a helicopter
On the flight collective you can trim it to counter the rotation
80% is really high, normally I trim like 10% at most
Its somewhat magic, itll hit the specific target the TADS is pointed at
Do they pick targets? I was under the impression that the weapon knew exactly which target it was going for when launched
Neat
In trying to check that, I found this
:risagony:
Looks like 60 degrees
Looks like it might
theres some weird bitwise math but I think that only checks the type, and bunkers are included in that type
it should instantly kill you, is it not doing that?
well there you go
its to prevent nausea due to a tail loss spin
:thonkery: its far better than the eject handle then
Most of the time ejecting leads to death still
:Think:
what about sitting on the ground going mach 0?
you still die
on the ground a good 75% of the time I still die for some reason
and if the aircraft has even a few deg/sec of roll you die
Theres no mute option in the heli or the 45
you are on modded
But you still have the mod loader running
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQpn1gc2gL4
Sorry, your friend is
its an AOA indicator, when the velcoity vector is on the middle dash you have the propper AoA
You can inverted fly level for a few seconds until your airspeed drops too low
The heli climbs extremely good in game lmao
You can climb at a few thousand fpm
Isn’t faster just always better
Iv flown above that but it definitely gets harder
theres an option for it if you have two monitors
its a vtol option
They should be able to
but have you tried every combination of two buttons?
The 45 semi-randomally chooses weapons to use, im not sure the exact logic but its not "external always first"
God no I want this for the 120s, legitimately the most frustrating part about vtol rn is the 45s tendency to use internal weapons first over external ones
Ill see "4 AIM-120" on my hud, think "ok I can jet my external", press the button and suddenly I have only 2 120s left
Yeah that would be best
I mean, yes, but in a fight thats a lot of config I might have to be doing
the switch to internal has the following steps: - JET KNOB to EXT - Jetison - Open SMS MFD - Select "ARMING" mode - press on left  - press on mid-left - press on mid-right - press on right - reopen whatever page was open before SMS
Thats a *lot* of steps, and means until I do those steps my HUD weapon count is incorrect
HUD only shows armed weapons
Helps reduce RCS
Its a very big issue, im constantly accidently dropping weapons I would have kept had I realized, my strategy/gameplay revolves around how my RCS and mass evolve throughout a fight, using the correct weapons in the correct order is important there
pylons remain the but parts of it drop off, additionally I often intend to get rid of a weapon or two
I run 2x AIM-9 and 4x 120 external, im often fine with ditching those AIM-9s once iv used all the 120s
The increase in RCS the missiles give is not countered by the effectivness of the 9s, depending on situation ofc
they do
if you ever equip external pylons you'll have higher RCS even after jetison
but its relativly little compared to the RCS of the missile thats normally on the pylon
Looks like I might actually be wrong about that
Not 100% sure
Which in any case would mean even more reason to use the jet knob
Yeah I always use it anyways even if the missile isnt there
Looks like the *launch rail* will add a tiny bit of RCS (0.25?) but the wing pylon is purly aesthetics
That might be a *bit* too far imo, havint to manually jet specific or jet all ext is a good balance imo
Depends on the weapon iirc
Something like an APC or tank likely has a far different radar return than regular ground
not without disabling all flight assist which makes the jet unflyable
trim is an adjustment to the zero point of the stick/peddles
you can use it to counteract persistant forces, such as the torque caused by the rotors
I personally don't use any
unless I specifically intend to take my hands off the controls for a period of time
Yeah
I have peddles so even when my hands are off the stick I can keep counter-torque
With peddles you don't even notice it
Angle between the nose of the aircraft and the velocity vector
Most aircraft are lifting bodies, your aoa matters compared to that as well
And the wing is connected to the nose isn’t it :Think:
In vtol if your wings aren’t connected to a nose then your aoa is the least of your concerns
there are fox-1s in game just the player cant use them
Yeah the SAAW uses fox-1 type missiles
Yeah temeprz?
Wanna check the game?

I found that message from 10/27/2020
Theres no "morale", AI recently got RWRs so they should react to your pings but I don't think they react differetly to a hard lock

patch notes say so at least
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/926222541952004127
Part of the MP PT
also btw the enemy AWACS is a part of the A2A objective of that mission
> I also noticed it while flying that the direction I'm actually heading in is way off from where my nose is pointed Yeah thats what the counter toque is for, you should in general point your nose in the same direction as where you are going
its not constant rudder, you have to input the countering force yourself and it changes based off situation
:risitas:
there should be a small drift even when perfectly level due to the latteral force being applied by the anti-torque rotor
It might help, but at the end of the day you are applying a force latterly which will cause drift
I want to go back to seeing a `HULL` value on the HUD 😔
Everything in vtol needs to do 2x damage tho
I mean I get small arms not doing anything
But, an AIM-120 direct hit should take out an aircraft most of the time
For AI units, id agree
Taking a missile from them and surviving is great
For PVP, it feels terrible as the person shooting
yeah, impact directly on the canopy should equal death
And a 120 has so much explosive it'll practically disintigrate any aircraft IRL unless they get extremly lucky
And also its extremely luck based
And means people can almost always choose to fly the dumbest way possible, get hit by a 120, then be perfectly fine to shoot back over and over again
wdym?
I mean I never intentionally got hit
Not everyone just fires every missile they have at the same target lol
thats an extremly poor way to play the game
and 200% damage would encorage people not to spam, as is shooting a single missile rarely gets a kill
have you played with 200% damage on?
No :harold:
shooting 10 missiles back to back is barely better than shooting a single one, with the exception of the amount of damage it does
?
Thats not true at all
Im free rn, want to test in game?
?
I don't know what you mean
Lets hop in game and test if, fly the 26 with like what, 16 missiles it can carry, fire them all at me, and we will see how many hit me
or the 45 if you want, but you can carry less missiels
Oh yeah, theres no setting rn
a setting for it would be :justright:
sure, but, IRL a 120 would delete it if it hit anywhere near the main body
yeah true
but, mach 3 335 lb object, plus 50lb of high explosive
Trial and error
All aircraft in VTOL operate on simular ideas and functions
Being high is basically always bad in vtol
They do especially in MP
I dunno about single player if they do
they wont hold the lock tho
Ehh to some extent, you should get an idea of the range of SAMs, as well as learn the difference between a sam site locking you for a second vs actually firing
enable head track then press forward/backward
allow you to save and load your MFD layout
I thought you still had to be facing generally the right direction?
Could be wrong, I dont use cruise missiles often
Might be a difference between 161's and 89's
at least one of them I think requires pointing the right way
Increased control/ability over the aircraft
roll assist off increases your roll rate quite a bit
Its entirely situational if you want to disable all of them, but in general I don't disable all of them at the same time
Sometimes ill disable pitch so I can pull harder, sometimes ill disable roll so I have better roll rates, sometimes ill disable yaw to intentionally induce a flatspin or to allow better over-the-top manuvers in dogfights etc etc
Iirc theres only two switches in game that I never use
practice
but also
I rarely disable FAs
He asked "any reason", but there are many reasons "why not"
someone better at flying or who practiced would likely find benefit in it tho
The only reason I ever disable FA's if i want to do flyshow/weird manuvers, or if I want to inrcrease the difficulty of flight
to explain more, I test and try anything that I think will help, the only way to get better is to practice, but not just practice the same thing over and over again, but to try and test new things and see how they work. Iv done countless of dumb things to try to work out what works in a fight and what dosn't
Especially in BFM I typically know what my first step is going to be, and I intentionally very what that first step is even if what im doing is working just to test and learn
when you want to die
:shrug:
But I mean I can't exactly answer that questin as its wayyyyyy too circumstantial
:Think: im a terrible teacher
I can teach the very basics of BFM, beyond that all my knowledge is via practice and experimentation, which means 99% of the time im doing things autoamtically without really knowing *why* im doing that
I can't explain what to do until im doing it basically
The tournament is not a test of skill with the ruleset that exists
With a 1v1 between 45s to truly test skill you need specific rules, and even then luck plays a *huge* factor
With the tournaments ruleset its going to be extremly luck based
Maybe
I know how you fight so id counter what you do to some extent
Idk hard to put into words
But the point is its going to be fairly luck based, just by sheer chance of who spots who when, how does the damage model want to be today, do IR missiles want to intercept targets well
do 120s want to tank AIM-9s etc etc
tomarrow you can be my heli gunner
:Think: then explain why most gunners are shit
CAW8 gunners are fine
its the randos
nan
except I suck at training so
:mildpanic:
I just want more heli missions
fuck the custom mission support I want baha missions :Crycat:
iirc my in game pilot says ~300hrs of flight, but iv also learned not to trust that so idk
I want a high difficulty heli mission
Midnight Assassin is basically a joke and Urban Liberation just takes a lil bit
k well I can use that to take out all the ground targest before the helis even get to the AO :Think:
but yeah no to be serious I think a 26/94 mission would be fun
> generating Missions is not rocket science for this game Baha's missions are *far* better than most player made missions so I wouldn't be suprised if it takes longer/more effort
> so why not add for example PvP variations with Helicopters and planes do you mean helis and planes fighting in the same mission?
Helis would not fit in with the rest of the aircraft in a pvp setting
they are far too slow and limited in ability
It would take 21 minutes to fly to the objective assuming it didnt get shot down once
you'd need a *lot* of strong AA to prevent jets, and the helicopters aren't interacting with the jets at all they just happen to be in the same match
they operate on completly differnt scales and styles, it wouldn't be a PVP heli and jet mission, it would be a jet PVP with a heli PVP happening to happen near by
coop != pvp
and at least a 26 has no issue dealing with both a2a and a2g at the same time
its 2D only
Zeus mode when
I barely care about custom mission support, it would have been terrible to delay just for that
I mean I don't care about knowing or not, just about when lol
I already tend to prefer to fly the heli solo you better not put a third seat on it
ahhh ok
thats fine
Honestly I don't think lobby counts have dropped that much past the first week (which, like anything has a massive peak then dip)
Looking at steam chats its mostly consistent after the initial
I mean he @ everyones everytime theres an update so yeah
> You can't just conjure up clicky clacks from nowhere I mean technically isnt that what hiring is?
Hire C to make the sex mod official
Best game period
Im not sure exactly when I started, I think before the 45 was a thing? Dunno exactly. I dropped it for a while then I saw the drewski video on the mp mod
v0.0.17p4 is when the hull indicator was removed, so I must have been playing a bit before that
which speaking of, an aircraft damage state MFD would be nice even if its a bit gamey
aparently Shamebird suggested this like two years ago
@Shadowtail does your pfp trigger some sort of nsfw filter? For weeks now iv not been able to see it on IOS
nan
Prob just discord being dumb
rip
Guns against other helis is good
against anything with fixed wings your best bet is to land/hide
the panel comes up based off what your hovering over
however the EOTS and GPS-S buttons are based off what is selected
do you have the blue dotted circle around it?
Loose an elevator, turn off pitch SAS, pull as hard as you can
I actually prefer to fly alone
you can do everything from the rear cockpit
Ierdna shut
Imo, don’t touch trim until your airborne and going
Through that take off your required yaw input fluctuates quite a bit, trying to trim for that will hurt
145 is better as an AGM
65's are good as SEAD, but honestly I find myself prefering 39s just do to where I can mount them and quantity
If I need to hit a target from far away, id use an 88, if I can get close, I can carry more bombs, plus bombs are nice when hitting multiple targets at the same time
If my target is a boat tho, 65s are great
88s to take out radars, 65s to finish them off
?
they are extremly short range
you are either on modded version or on the test branch
Thats just because most people are not on test branch
go to stable branch???
on steam
you clicked
"public testing" yes?
now, press "none" instead
Sounds like your landing on the wrong spot, the aircraft is larger than you realize, land “on” the wires not before them
Yeah that’s bad, land later than that
Nothing directly tells you, its entirely based off what you see on sensors/your range/visually IDing the missile etc etc
But, radar guided missiles will show as a RED M at close range
its only open comms if you have the intracomm knob set to on
:Think: using tads to land is great
I almost never land without tads
Well yeah I can land plenty fine without it
but, might as well use it
no reason not to
:Think: id yell back
tf does your gunner think he needs the TADS for on a landing
very true
:Think: I could land blind folded if someone was there to tell me what to do
We should try it
in a jet tho
I made that statment in refrence to jet
:thonkery:
Well the heli is gunna be rough
IR missiles are only effected by "heat sources", which the terrain does not count as so no
Also, the sun and the moon also do not count as a heat source
Yeah sun has no effect on IR missiles in vtol
Yeah radars themselves don't care about chaff, just missiles
and AAA
no :Think:
I am
Yeah the `LockingRadar` class dosnt do anything with chaff
All refrences to chaff in that class are for the *old* radar type
nan
VTOL has whats called "advanced radar" and non-advanced. In the game as it is, all radars are "advanced radars"
yes, look at that check chaff module
it always returns false
you can tell chaff has its effect because the missile will keep its lock on you, but turn away from you
nan
These are extreme examples, it tends to have a less of an effect
Chaff when someone has fired a missile at you, its best while notching
and factors like range, aspect, speed etc have a big impact
In function, none
just oneis better than the other
airs-t is simply better in every regard
near the back facing down for the 26
nan
Chaff/flare dispensers
The "mark" button is only related to the visual laser you see with NVGs, there is always an invisible laser that can guide laser weapons
TGP, F-45 can do from radar emissions, you can create a GPS point if you know where it is on the water
Yeah, i don't recommend it
its fairly safe to get close enough to use TGP
if you want to be extra safe, get <25 -> create GPS -> turn cold for a ways -> turn back hot and fire
its your acceleration vector
so where the circle with the lines is your velocity, that is your acceleration, its super useful to noticing how you are drifting/what your true acceleration is compared to what you expect
That’s a fairly abstract question, in general the #1 way by farrrrrr is to just avoid LOS as much as possible
Like C said, heat seekers are very easily fooled with flares (I typically do two -> half second -> two), radar guided do your best to notch assuming you have zero terrain to help
That being said, simply avoid being somewhere that a radar guided missile can shoot at you
With the exception of the SAAW radars are stationary (ok mad4 can move and so can boats, but boats are slow and mad4 can’t search and move at the same time)
sounds like your missing a step, but make sure the weapon is in the correct mode
if the pilot selected a different mode it syncs to the gunner when you load in
Yeah go to EQUIP, select the 145, and select uncage mode. And I mean that if the pilot has trig uncage off, then when the gunner loads it, they will also have trig uncage off as well
so as a gunner when you load in always check the weapon settings
Every weapon has different settings
for the 145, the only option is "trig uncage" which allows manual uncaging of the weapons seaker head
when trig uncage is set to true, it will slave the missiles sensor to wherever you have the tpg pointed only when you hold the trigger
with it set to false, it slaves automatically
with trig uncage and holding trigger the FOV you have to slave to the target is higher which is useful
145 is just better period
radar display has ranges on it, if you lock a target you'll have `R` next to the info read out, on the TSD hovering the cursors over a target will show an info box in the bottom right that also has `R`
R is range in whatever distance units you selected, normally nautical miles
depends, in general for combat thats where I leave it
But pre-combat or if im interested in targets far away ill go to 25
sidarms are so short range anyways, how would you use them effectively?
> pop over a hill and oh shit it's a sam site! Can't you still do that with them already?
you can just select the target before you launch
I guess id just recommend practice, ill typically move the selecting pipper near to where im expecting targets, or think targets could appear, then once they do its one button press to select, then one to fire
Btw "pitbull" refers to radar guided missiles, here the correct term would be "lock on" or LOAL
:Think: I got confused a few times
Im not trying to nitpick
it was just a note
:shrug:
I wonder what the fov of IRL ARMs are
I have a feeling they either need to have been told where the target is (as the AGM-88 does), or be close in the fov
so maybe a boresight mode could be good
IRL/DCS yeah, VTOL 120s work a bit differently
Ye
It knows who to lock and searches for them specifically
Its a bit more complex than in-cone but yeah
It still uses teh normal radar logic
so notching, chaff, RCS, ground clutter etc are taken into account
Honestly I had a valid need for it yesterday, I was trying to take out AAA but they dont turn on their radar unless you are close
Well its not vcap mode, but viffing is very good
Yeah thats kinda BS, I really wish it wasnt in the game
AI are buggy in MP when your not the host
Iirc its worse when the host is farther away
the DLZ is shown on the HUD
no
not in the ah94
Looking at the hud is at the target
avoid tunnel vision, you should be looking up more than looking down
you cannot hit targets at 11+ nm in the heli
and, for AGMs the nose of the heli has to be roughly pointed in the correct direction, which means it will be in the HUD
ill use mi instead ierdna
Ok well sure, but in general your normal range is far lower
for an AGM the nose of the aircraft has to be roughly (within 30ish degrees) pointed at the target so you should see the DLZ
you'll see the DLZ and that tells you weapon range
nan
?
Up at nothing?
keeping tunnel vision down is bad 100% of the time
Pipker said much the same thing
you should  *always* have out of the cockpit looking to be a part of your crosscheck
the #1 issue I see with gunners is their inability to look up from the screens
but IRL you'd *never* fire without your crosscheck including looking up
This is what a normal weapon employment looks like for me -> roughly get/find target using headtrack -> quickly look down, select target on TADS/see range -> Look up to see AGM targeting redical, set pylon tilt, and check other important weapon employment values (airspeed, altitude, physical obstructions, off-bore angle, DLZ, etc) -> fire
Firing a weapon without looking up is really really bad
nan
this is range symbology
Its not super far out of range but yes
the computer is not perfect
there is skill in learning the game/your weapons and knowing when they will hit, the DLZ is a guide in that regard
I refrence the DLZ, but use my own knowledge to supplement it
you should never rely 100% on any singular instrument
nooo the hollow is "no escape range" and the open sided is "can will hit but target might be able to dodge"
carret is right there
Also in vtol the NER is a bit wak, it dosn't actually mean anything and is basically hard coded to be 50%, so just reference the DLZ as a whole not the NER
red - below range/too close green - no escape range* yellow - in range
but, like I said, the DLZ is far from perfect, so you use it as a guide not a gospel of truth
indicator tends to underestimate the range, takes some learning but you'll get a sense for when you are in range and when you aren't DLZ helps with that, for 145s waiting until your in DLZ range will mean you have a nearly garenteed chance of hitting assuming its not shot down
:thonkery: its only purpose for existance is bunkers
wiki has lots of issues
it has the same explosive payload of a regular 39
nan
Yeah lofting is a very normal thing for bombs
with the 94 you can use pylon tilt to get loft without even needing to pitch up
DLZ is super helpful in a bunch of places, you can get a sense for where you are actually in range according to it, its a very quick visual way to tell your range to the target and if for instance if the DLZ is more out of range than you expected it can bring your attention to something you missed such as being lower than you expected, or slower or whatever
Its like a clock that moves at 50% speed, sure the display dosnt show the actual time, but it can be used to figure out the time
temperz
AGM-88 is one of the few weapons in game that require launch authorization to fire
too slow then
optimal sustained
however for merge/instantanious you can get around the circle quicker
if you find a way please let me know
Its very possible you are turning at the same rate
however if your circles are not aligned, itll apear they get around quicker
make sure you are already rolled the direction you want to be before the merge
so you cna pull as quickly as possible
The DLZ has values that baha manually set from testing, then it tries to use those manually set values plus a combination of factors (target aspect, your altitude/speed, their altutde speed) to ajust the values accordingly
its semi-dynamic, uses some fixed values to try to estimate
the higher the range the higher the chance of intersept is so ill sometimes yell at my gunner when he takes super long shots when there is no need to
just because it *can* hit dosn't mean we *need* to fire rn
yea
especially in pvp watching people wait for the DLZ is hilarious
you should never 100% trust any part of the aircraft
your a human, the reason you exist as a pilot is to be able to make the decisions the computer cannot to make you more leathal
using the DLZ as a guide not a gospel of truth is an important step in that
not bad info
just not 100% accurate
the DLZ can be extremly valuable to give you a sense or idea of the situation/range you have, as long as you have na understanding that you must include other data into your decision to fire
I talked about this earlier, its like a clock that moves at 2x speed, its not accurate, but it can still be used to tell time as long as you do some math first
Ultimatly its a display of data, just the way you interprete that data is a bit different than initially expected
I agree it should be fixed, but I disagree that its a major issue or that its useless
you don't need burn time or supposed max range? You just need practice and experience
IRL pilots are trained so that they don't even need the DLZ, and its not the ground source of truth
nor do I
however, over the course of hundreds of missile shots iv gotten pretty good about estimating when it will hit or not
Not looking at numbers or data
just by understanding/experience
Damn shadow you really take every fucking chance to attack me over decompiling dont you
this has nothing to do with that
nah fuck off, its months of you constantly saying you disrespect me or don't like me or whatever over this
not once or twice, it happens all the time
and you bring it up out of no where
when its not even relavent to the conversation
You think I know the DLZ is inaccurate because of that?? No, I just play the damn game, but I can't even have a conversation about it without being accused of my knowledge only being because I have decompiled the game
Everytime I say anything that I know just because I play the game a lot im accused I somehow gained this knowledge in an unfair way, no I just *play the game*. I know the dlz is inaccurate because iv seen missiles miss when they shouldnt have
because iv spent hours testing various ranges
What do I show off??
No where in this conversation did I ever mention decompiling
?? where??
The most recent time was when I noticed a bug with tank damage
but I didn't even mention that until asked
anyone can decompile and mod the game, I tell everyone that askes about it that they can learn
What
I was talking to temperz about an unrelated project we are working on
:Think:
Yes I did in a clearly sarcastic way and then immediately said it would be cheating
and thats not related to decompiling
nor related to modding
nor related to this conversation
No
that was me talking with temperz, and being excited about a program im working on that adds tacview support to the game, not bragging about decompiling just being excited for tacview support
so if trying to help the comunity with things like that is bragging then you're free not to use it
you litterly can't use it while playing the game
so?
I was talking to a friend
not on me if you missunderstand and judge me for it
k if you think thats showing off then sure
in the same way that ATCBot is showing off
im workin on a program for the comunity, im excited to get it working
don't gotta attack me for it
idk id just like to be respected for enjoying a game we are all here for
my eula violations are justified :Think:
and you are complicit
id stay away from cruise missiles, and honestly every time I have done that mission iv found that I hardly needed to do any a2a, the AI would take care of that so typically I only carry heat seakers on the two outer pylons where I can carry 6 of them. I use two of my HARMs for long range SAMs, then ill use SBDs or AGMs to take out the rest
Also, iv found you don't need to fly with the escort objective, you can just fly a beeline into the AO
wiki tends to be a poor place to find recommendations for how to do missions
RWR has no blind spots, the MWS has some blindespots
LPI is not modeled (the radars we have act like mech-scanned anyways), C looked into making LPI but the current model dosnt really allow for it
radiation strengths are a thing, and the radar sim in vtol is decently complex
narrowing scan cone IRL for a mechscanned radar dosnt increase energy, it just increases scan rate, which does happen in vtol
idk about aesa
Maybe? AESA has such a high scan rate anyways that idk if it makes much of a difference? Idk aesa wak
luck by happening to press the correct button
for dropping bombs in the internal bay, hold the trigger then press the weapon switch button
holding the trigger opens the door, pressing teh button releases the bomb
Also press and hold the layout set number to save a preset, then press it once to restore a preset @IHave
that saves a ton of time
It uses your PCs default mic, I think your controller has a ptt button but also you can grab at your left sholder
I have mine at 10 personally
In the MFD page labeled “options”
the scale of VTOL is a lot smaller than IRL/games like DCS
so where as you'd normally detect a target from 50-60 mi away in vtol its more like 20-30
I mean IRL a 120d has a range of what, 80+ nm?
Because of how VTOL BVR works, against a non-stupid target its fairly rare to get kills >20 mi away
Still happens ofc, but rare compared to kills happening <20mi
out of curiosity where did you find the 22 second burn time? (its correct, but im curious)
Iv seen 22 seconds personally be about right
:oknice: some people think thats impossible so I just wanted to check
iv gotten kills at 60 mi against hot targets
but thats a hot target that does zero defense until the missile pitbulls
oh well that was in a 45, 26 is limited by radar
against "real" targets you'd really struggle to hit at that range
Well theres a lot of players that have no idea what they are doing
by "real" I mean a player that at least knows/has some experience with how to BVR
what altitude were they at?
Yeah I rarely ever climb above 10k ft
He should have never been up there imo :risitas:
sure your weapons have a bit more range
but theres countless advantages to being lower
be very low
get very close
if there are 45s on your team as well they should be able to force the enemy 45s to stay fairly low
the 26 is also quite good at dodging missiles so get good at that so that when the 45 fires you can track them down
dont fly around with your radar on
only turn it on once you are ready to fire
can you be more specific? What issues are you having?
:Think:
yes
what are those problems
If you are in an F-45, and trying to drop bombs from internal bays you have to hold the trigger then press teh weapon switch button to drop them
step one, don't let them shoot missiles at you
Well then depends on the missile type
you mentioned flares,, so for IR missiles cut throttle to either zero or low, and then drop a few flares
notch+chaff+break line of sight
Means to fly 90deg compared to the radar
so put the radar/missile on either wing tip, to your 3 oclock or 9oclock
If they are close then then its likely an IR missile, if the missile is close, but there is no red M on your rwr its IR
if its fired from long range, or theres a red M then its a radar
all except IRAPCs and manpads
the F-45 has a single radar, its got the "RADAR" page, but what is most used is the TSD, which will show data from all datasources avalible to it
I need to take a good screenshot at some point, but this is what mine looks like
very simular to Shenanigans just with some of my mini windows rearanged
No bad
who cares where north is, I care about whats in front of me
ierdna just point your plane north if you really need it
why do you need fixed north for the TSD while flying :Think:
TSD is meant to tell you about threats, it should be top = forward
Radar page is a great option for knowing when a track file is stale or not, or knowing when the data source is from your own aircraft or from another, or for knowing if the target is in your line of sight or not. POINT mode on the radar also achieves this, and is personally what I use now that its a feature, but POINT comes with a few limitations
Iv had sometimes odd results with EOTS button slaving to a point that isn't where the target is, especially before baha changed how eots works
Uhh don't trust the wiki here
ehhhhhhh
yes?
but its more complex than that
the plane cannot magically track the target
*some* sensor needs ot keep updating it
however, if no sensor updates the target it will use the last know velocity and position to try to guess where the target is
dosn't matter, just some "datasource"
The F-45 operates using data sources, and track files
a track file can be created via any number of data sources
a missile is guided using a track file
track files will try to "guess" where the target is using the last known data
maddog means you have fired without a target selected and the radar is only relying on its internal radar, so no
you must fire at a track file
it *can* be a "predicted" track file
predicted track files are track files with no data-source, so the aircraft is using the last known data to guess
not for the F-45
Not ever for the 45
it was changed recently
It might
this change wasn't noted in any patch notes
iv reported it as a bug, not sure if its intended
its also possible that what we see as "random detonate" could be the missile hitting the "missed" condition
once a 120 has decided its missed, it will self destruct
if its the only data source you have available yes
If a target manuvers, the "predicted" track will be incorrect, so you need to provide data in order for it to still be accurate
now, 120s in this game have a *huge* FOV
180 degrees
which means even if its somewhat inacurrate itll still manage to find the target often
The most bs is when you watch one go over a mountain, *practically* behind you, and it still hits bcs the radar just has such a high fov
nan
If you mean using 120s as scouts, it works quite well when setup correctly
Yeah lamo
You can see in this video tracking on a predicted track file, because I was failing to provide another data source. In this case, the extreme FOV of the missile helped me be lucky, but in general thats why you want to provide data as long as possible
but if the options are - provide data to missile - defend incomming missile obviously the choice should be to defend
well never take your eyes off your opponent
make sure your not going too fast
Depends on your altitude, at 10k ft ill typically aim for ~0.85 mach
Not instantaneous rate speed tho
Unless you are very specficially in a rate fight you want to be going faster
and, you never want to pull back the throttle to get to that speed, when we say "rate speed" we mean pull the stick until you are going that speed not the throttle
Energy managment? Thats bullshit just pull the stick back and win
But no more seriously, its just about practice, I know very very little about the "consepts" of BFM, everything I know is just from hours of practice which imo is the best way to learn BFM
exactly
for the 45,  viff
for the 26, just get good at BFM basically
id gladly snap off the fan cover to viff
less restricted = less thrust?
Less restructed = more thrust
I don't think the cover has any major benefit to producing thrust
Yeah thats your acceleration vector
On the NAV MFD?
Changes the altitude at which you create GPS points
which is espeically useful for NAV AP
auto pilot
bulseye position
`degrees/miles`
in reference to the bullseye
practice and go slowly
Yeah lol I noticed it not that long ago, I haven’t gotten around to using it but it seems very handy
Me tooo, I happened to at some point by chance circle it around the bullseye when I was bored and as soon as I saw the number go 0-360 it made sense
tbf your accuracy at that range is pretty shit
I did a run of urban liberation with only hydras and I got the bad spawn for the MCs which was painful
quite,  quite far
iv hit at 60 nm
its extremly situational
@C-137 change your name to “IHadALife” or something like that (I won’t let you escape @IHave :defaultdance: )
So C is changing his nickname every day or so as a knock off of someone else’s name
Apparently, today C is called “IHad”
:thonkery: C was supposed to change his name not you
Stringer not javelin
javelin is for tanks
Im 99% sure there's a bug that if your the client IR signatures are incorrect, try playing as the host and im willing to bet you'll be able to use them
ah
well yeah
skill issue
Iv gotten plenty of kills with them :shrug:
no the 92s
AIM-92 is the IR missile the AH-94 gets
nan
There's only one mission that has you against air targets, and they are slow movers so
and even that mission you can ignore them if you wanted
they are a last resort weapon, you're not meant to be fighting aircraft
which is why the missions are designed for you to never engage aircraft
Noo the point is that stingers have their use, especially against slow aircraft like GAV-25s
In urban liberation you complete the mission far faster if you shoot down the gavs
which is the primary thing I use them for
as for the question of "why are they an option", theres a lot of weapons in vtol that are very situational/only have one or two places they can be used well, 92s are just another one in that batch
Thats a pretty abstract question, in general you play like normal but the stealth means you can get closer without being detected and that its easier to avoid missiles
That’s true stealth or not
yeah buddy lasing can typically be done by GPS, you press GPS-S, they press GPS-A and bam buddy lasing achived
if you press "SEND" on the GPS page yes
nan
it sends the entire group you had selected, and itll create a matching group on the other end
IRL radar operators intelligently turn on and off their radar, but I think it would be hard to replicate in game without just being annoying, or not working at all
as a mission designer you could probably do that tbh
only have one radar on, once its destroyed trigger a different one
Im working on a program that would hopfully be simular to that, but its fairly far out from being ready
VTOL bombs already have insane CEP because half they time they fly off who knows where and miss
also directional antennas help
satellites are up, don't listen to the noise below
:harold:
Ehh im all for EW, im not sure a straight jamming of GPS at all times is very fun in that regard
All it does is change a well placed GPS bomb from being a confirmed hit, to a game of luck
:thonkery:
> satellite based jamming
Me going to space to kill the jammer
The mission creator can limit what loadout you use, so they can simulate a "GPS denied environment"
@Joppert Flaps setting is entirely dependent on situation. Things like length of the runway, your current mass, if you are doing an arrested landing etc etc. In general, if the aircraft is light I never use flaps 2 (I find it makes it harder to do carrier landings when light). If I am heavy, then ill use flaps2 for landings. If I am super heavy, ill use flaps2 for both take off and landing
:Think:
.6 twr can p easily take off without a cat
I would test
BUT THE MISSIONS WONT LET ME
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
that would involve opening the mission editor
@ierdna100
also I have ***43 minutes*** of AB with this much fuel
I had maximum so
look at my TWR on the screen
Yeah big bags plus CFT
most fuel you can possibly carry
I *think* iv done it before
In general, ranges you can use weapons is quite different than real life
But you can hit at 10-11 miles so range is pretty decent
head track dosn't effect range
However, fireing far off bore will effect range as the missile has to waste a bunch of energy to turn
Iirc its not modelled
it is
Its more of a factor in the 45 where having internal weapons only lowers your RCS by a *ton* compared to if you add any external weapons
Invisible? No, it just means the range at which you are seen is much lower, the 45 is most stealthy directly looking forwards so if something looks at you from straight below itl will still easily see you
and people can detect you using the EOTS system
Yeah directional RCS is modeled
Yep the radar model is quite complex
https://gfycat.com/chubbyslightgrunion
@TortillaDeMuerte
Oh I pinged the wrong person
whoops lol
Iv heard reports of being unable to use aim-120s to shoot them down if you are in an F45
If not been able to confirm that tho
the targeting pod must be equipped on the hardpoint
It’s not 90 I think, but I’m not sure what it is, and there might be some funkiness with it. I remember a while ago someone did testing for how high over someone you’d have to be to fly over their radar
RCS isn’t a size, it’s more of a scaler that determines how much energy is sent back to tne transmitter
:Think: k ill remember that next time you ask a question
Heli notching is extremly powerful due to low speed and high manuverability
Rotors probably have a tiny RCS and you need a smart computer to be able to handle it probably
So it would be notciable, assuming the returned energy was enough, given the angle and size of the blades it seems like the RCS is realllly low, plus a doppler system would have issues tracking a helicopter as the value its reading for velocity is the blades, not the aircraft itself
If you have questions about it feel free to ask here
lack of skill, you must train 8hrs a day to get them back
It’s not closest, i think it’s random which leads to very odd choices of launcher sometimes
Quite often I see a missile fire at an incoming missile but it’s from like 15mi away bcs it chose the wrong launcher
I use AGMs on anything that has a significant chance of hurting me (tanks, radars, apcs) and the guns on soft targets (manpads, gunboats etc)
I prefer 20mm as at least all the current missions don’t throw more than 16 armored targets at you so I just use AGMs for em
And 20mm still works against armor so
Wish we got more moving threats, the urban liberation convoy has killed me more than anything else in that mission
Meh Baha makes really good missions, far better than I could
I recommend AGM-145s as the general best weapon against SAMs, its got good range and if you want to be stealthy you can carry them internally
161s are big and heavy so you can't carry a lot of them
Should bring both, 120s are much longer range but are bad when close in
aim-9s are great close in
pitbull range is dependent on target loadout and aspect
It’s to buff the F-45 :Crycat:
Previously at night if a 45 pointed their EOTS at you you’d see the big ass laser but now they can disable it
I tend to use the TGP to get close enough to someone before I turn on my radar
Well
it was added v1.3.0p50
before that you'd still need a radar lock
Actually before that I think you could *guide* without radar lock, but needed the lock to launch
Yes but only by modifying the VTS file
means go away from the enemy
145s don’t do terrain avoidance
They fly in a straight line until the optical seeker can see the target
When you are within DLZ range and hold tne trigger you’ll see a LOAL indicator on your hud that tells you where the missile is going to fly
Im not sure if LOAL even works outside of DLZ range, the indicator dosnt show at the very least
but 145s are optical, and switching targets with laser weapons can cause issues especially the longer you wait to switch targets
Not really, the wiki has some but it can be spotty and inconsistant (and incorrect in some places)
65ish miles
at most
65 is best assuming the missile travels at its max speed the entire time and dosn't manuver at all
which of course, is not how the missile actually flies
best *range* it could possibly get
Clearly you haven’t learned of our lord and savior CCIP
Honestly I’m really not a fan of them, they are useful for hitting singular targets and moving targets, but for groups trying to manage the EOTS while staying within the release zone is annoying and tends to lead to misses
Well there’s always guns
Wait does CCIP give lead?
I thought only CCRP would
Will it lead for GPS bombs tho, CCRP with gps bombs uses gps points as it’s target not the TGp
Its an optical weapon, so multiple targets
if my gunners dont shoot I shoot for them
Just gotta take it quicker than him and don't let go of both controls :itsfreerealestate:
but yeah really need a gunner ban option
its an option map creators setup
im fine with flying with 95% of people, its the 5% trolls/assholes that are the problem
:thonkery: I don't let go of the controls
at least not both at the same time
autorotate landing ez
nan
And it’s even worse because that guy has been harassing me for months
He does shit like switch teams to kill me
the 42 has its roles that no other aircraft does better
There was a mission recently, dunno its name off the top of my head but it allowed for all aircraft, but the 42 was the best pick. You had a pretty wide set of objectives that included killing SAMs, clearing cities of MANPADS, clearing AAA etc
No other aircraft could do it better
the 42 has long range HARMs the other aircraft cant carry, the 45 dosn't really have good SEAD weapons (got the 145 but thats it), the 42 can carry all the relavent weapons the 26 can (65's, HARMs, GPS bombs), the 26 can carry a *comparible* loadout to the 42 yes, but hitting targets like AAA or MANPADS is done *waayyyyyyy* better with the gimble gun
You can *technically* use the 26s gun on the targets, but its far far more difficult and the chance of you getting hit is way higher
also the 42 deletes the 26 in a dogfight
Well ok yes but shhhh
I used the chad GPS bomb so
its the same way you lock things with the regular radar, should be pressing straight down or whatever
yes
If you *can* land you should land, they got hit a while ago but the engine was still going for a while before they had to land so it wasn't a super urgent need to eject
ejecting is risky (forces/altitude and what not) plus leaves you vulnerable for quite a bit while your in the shoot and fully destroys the helicopter
Radars are really what you want to be targeting, for one HARMs can find them, and two in general there are less radars than launchers
Are there any specific missions you are struggling with? The way you do SEAD is heavily dependent on what type of sam systems you are fighting, and what the terrain looks like
AGM-88 HARM is a great weapon as you can typically fire at or just within the range of the SAM, and as its FAF you can immidiantly turn away from the threat
pitbull means an AIM-120 has switched to its internal radar
Which also means you can turn around or whatever as its no longer requireing external data
you can kinetically avoid them in some cases but its an edge case
turning far far increases the chance of the flares working
Im not sure 100% how it works but I think turning helps as it brings your heat source farther away from the flares
its the same reason why you don't want to just spam flares
Yeah which is why I want flare programs, click button and it drops two flares -> waits .25 seconds -> drops 3 flares
Luckily its not a %, its just math about what the missile can see, how far, how hot things are, etc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je4dYwtFwWc
Aspect, distance, your speed etc etc
You can still maneuver quite a bit even with vcap, just have to understand it’s a very different control scheme and the aircraft acts like it has a totally different flight model as the computer handles it for you
"all the time" meaning what exactly? If you don't have any targeting source set as SOI and the gun as your active weapon then yea itll always be on your head
when solo I typically run NAV and TADS, so when I need to do that I press the SOI switch button and the weapon swich button which slaves it to my head
or you can press the SOI button to select something like the NAV map
NAV can be SOId however it can't be used to aim the gun, so the gun will go the head tracked mode
radar can be used to slave the gun so no
Yeah, itll slave the gun to whatever you have locked
Nah the gun will slave directly
Ah I thought it would fix-forward when you don't have a lock, useful to know itll slave to head when theres no lock
when its head mounted pressing forward or backward will zoom
There's no (well theres a very small) time interval between zoom levels, once its set to your head you can very quickly press down
:thonkery: wum
**whatever you have locked**
When you have a target locked on radar its slaved to that
anyways gunning is hard and cring so
nah piloting is way more fun
piloting is more fun, and easier
yes
:Think:
no
id rather fly an av than gun for an av
yea theres a few in game
they have their own section somewhere cant remembenr exactly where the button is
there is "flight practice"
Missions/pvp really, doing things solo is espeically great if you can handle the difficulty
When you do something solo its 100% you doing everything, so its the quickest way to learn, you don't skip the hard parts by other people doing it or whatever
its a discord bot that shows what lobbies are open right now
it semi-frequently goes offline or misses some lobbies so make sure to check in game tho
best option is to point your wing tip at the target, so show your belly during the turn but then go wing level (well pointed at the target) as soon as you can
trying to yaw hard in forward flight will tend to not work, IRL you do turns using cyclic once you are in forward flight
hmm id have to see what you are talking about, it seems to have quite a lot of input for me
Are you setting the correct GPS altitude?
if you press "SEND" on the GPS page yes
one is hot one is shiny
the strat for the 26 tends to be to get super close, its got better IR missiles as well as better missile evasion so its fairly easy to close in
no cuz EOTS
you still wont see a 45 at 25 nm so it dosnt really matter
and that ^
Even there it’s not for sure, a target flying fast enough could G-pull and possibly make it miss
Or use terrain
You really can *never* be sure
It’s hard to even say a “normal” area where the missiles are likely to hit as it’s extremely situational
are you experiencing the bug where every other external AIM-120 fails to track?
Yea not sure what causes it, happens at random no idea why
Restarting your game will prob fix it
hes on the 26 and all other aircraft as well
weapons contribute a huge amount to the RCS of an aircraft
Im sure quite a few people who think flying the plane feels like flying the plane
fox2 is a heatseaker
for3 is an active radar guided
semi-active radar guided
basically it has no internal radar so is constantly guided from the launching computer
like the AIM-7
yea
Yeah
fox-3 means you have launched an AIM-120 in game
So I could be wrong, but I think if you just fire the missile, the pylon stays on which has a *bit* of RCS, but once you jetisone it gets rid of the pylon so there is *no* RCS
The mount has three parts, weapon, pylon, and mount. The mount will stay there yes, but I don't *think* it has RCS
weapon and pylon however do
so after you fire, you still need to jetisone
I mean to be fair, people in game are there to play not to teach
left to right, 1 2 3 4
iirc
I can never remember which direction they go
Recently, AH-94
pilot and by a long shot
gunning is hard and the ability to stay alive is in the hands of someone else
gunning is way harder than piloting
push to talk
Different aircraft can carry different weapons
If every aircraft can use every weapon nothing is unique
It’s not meta, it’s fun, additionally vtol isn’t a sim
Finally, you don’t see SU-27s running around with AIM-120s
Different aircraft are capable of carrying different weapons
The airst is not in the family of aim-9s, it’s dimensionally different and likely using different wording/rails
Not all American plans can carry all weapons
They get new weapons at different times, and some never get the ability to
Airs-t is a different weapon than the aim-9, it has different requirements, ones that the f-45 dosnt meet
If you want to complain about something, why can’t the 26 have 9+’s?
but even then the answer is different aircraft
the software/rail/mount cant support it
the big-ass fins wouldnt fit
nan
same length much different fin size
in the same regard, would you complain that the F/A-26b can't carry the AIM-120D?
Shouldn't all the aircraft get the same missiles?
the 120D has a different motor
and different radar
and different guidence logic that the 26 *would* use
Point is, the answer to the question is different aircraft carry/use different weapons, the 26 has the mavrick the 45 dosn't, the 45 has the 145, the 26 dosn't
the reason *why* is that you are considering weapons as their own thing, the weapons an aircraft carries is *integreral* to that aircraft, the aircraft is the airframe, the systems/software, and the weapons it uses as a whole
saying everything should use teh same weapons is akin to saying everything should use the same flight model
they are different platforms, and as such, use different weapons, just like they use different software
IRL aircraft carry vastly different weapons
you may disagree with it, but thats how its done IRL, and thats how baha has done it
^
yeah just unlock the target
missiles will guide on a TWS track
Yeah, even while hard locked TWS tracks will be updated
nan
oh
I read that as whats the point of turning on point
yeah it makes the radar hard lock
nah
its equally as accurate
Yea
theres a few good reasons for using it tho
well thats a bug
yea
it should be there
having a radar lock dosn't do anything special in the 45, the aiming cue should appear based off TSD selection
I like it for checking the validity of a track, for knowing when my radar *can* see the target (vs another data source), checking if I have line of sight, and for reducing my emissions
You cannot manually TWS targets in the 45
however its basically always TWSing what it can
"track while scan", the 45 works using track files, the radar creates trackfiles for anything it sees and thus it is basically TWSing everything
F-45s don't have AIRS-Ts
Its very possible the pilot of the f45 was just good
for pvp? the 45
Ehh I mean theres a *ton* to do in the 45, arguably more than in the 26
where information is displayed dosn't matter
TSD or MFD info is info
you rarely need more than two at a time
three is *helpful* espeically at night but eh
Fun fact, the AIM-9 *technically* has a better feature than the AIRS-T
"Max Torque Speed"
As well as torque delay
those are both better in the AIM-9
but, due to the fact that its torque ramp up rate is *half* and its max AoA is much lower, you'll never ever be able to see the benefit
:shrug:
the missile code is complex and im too bad at math
Ooo baha here to enlighten
theres a sort of sudo-gun radar that will auto-aquire a target infront of you
Ahh
Guessing the AIM-9 has higher because its fins are physically larger?
Nah the radar runs as admin
Seeing as you can't manually turn it off
guns and like 3k fuel
Vulcan 20mm cannon loaded with 800 rounds of self detonating HE ammo
For BFM?
None
:Think: they aren't proxy fuse
the 2v2 is a BVR encounter, you should use AIM-120's and AIRS-Ts
nice
fox-3 are *radar guided* missiles, HARMs don't have their own radar, they target radars, the callout is magnum
and fox 4 is guns
they are tho
the SAAW and the missile cruisers both have fox-1 missiles
no
the missile always switches to its internal radar as soon as possible
limiting warning time
Well
in game its true
the AI will callout fox-4
In vtol the aircraft AB don’t burn that much fuel, you can use it quite a bit, especially in the F-45
But the F-45 is the only aircraft in vtol with just one engine so you’d expect it to be a bit slower
It’s got an effect always, the effect becomes more and more powerful as you are more and more perpendicular
I really wish we had a burst option, press once and it drops 5 in a quick burst
so you have enough flares to beat one F/A-26b :Think:
980 drops way too much
its not uncommon for me, or even less with say, 6 launches which is quite reasonable that only gives me 2 kills before im out
IRL they sometimes use flares to try to distract each other with a high burst :risitas:
nah but the MWS does
and theres a *tiny* blind spot for the 45 if you get unlucky enough
when below one of the MWS sensors can always see it
the green arrow is just the global up direction
the plane isn't rotated here, but its to the plane
this was the lowest I found that there was a blind spot
the lines are basically defining cones/boxes that the MWS can see
if they are green, you are inside it, if they are yellow, they cant see you
so here that frontal MWS sensor can see me
the helicopter is shockingly good at flying up side down
wish baha would give the rotors just a tiny bit more negative pitch so its sustainable
equip -> m230 -> change `locked` to `slaved`
AIRS-Ts are better in basically every regard
the one big issue is cost, if your on a budget limited mission they are more expensive
Sometimes called the "WEZ" (weapons engagement zone) on IRL aircraft (both refer to the same thing)
It *does* take alt and speed into account, but it’s a rough calculation and won’t always be perfect
'Unit Icons' controls the name tags as well as the small icons
when creating the lobby
NAV AP will do that
You'll probably want to enable ALT AP as well
Notching is modeled, as well as directional RCS, so you need to be carful that when notching you don’t expose too much of your belly as that big flat surface will reflect quite a bit of radar energy back anyways
It’s typically best that once you have the radar 3 or 9 to wings level to reduce the surface area you are showing the radar
That being said, if you have no ground behind you then notching will have little to no effect, all radars in vtol are pulse Doppler so if it’s just clear sky it dosnt matter how much you are notching
Now obviously that’s where chaff comes into play
From what iv heard, DCS dosn't even model directional RCS so it might even be a bit more accurate
if you hold grip and then use your joystick you'll be able to use some gestures
wait does the quest 2 do finger tracking?
no I have the htc vive
ah
so yeah you can just use the pre-set gestures
Yeah, so for me I use the touch pad rather than a joystick
I want to upgrade to an index sometime soon
Especially for manipulating the mfds, a touch pad really isnt great
Yeah once I have the money ill be getting the headset + controllers, its nice that its backwards compatible so I don't have to get new base stations
:risitas: updrading to an index is mostly qol than anything else, the touch pads are annoying but they do work just fine
parallel
reduce collective
Ofc happy to help
Weight+cost
I wish hydras were more accurate
exactly, but you might want to carry nothing on that pylon
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16DD8d1NudAGreoYmacUhVrwygP6oRgFtgGqJXnbI4Jc/edit#gid=0
Its quite useful for dumb bombs, hydras, or creating a neat gun cam
https://youtu.be/bMYF0GdNdxQ?t=422
I use pip mode to hit the boats with hydras from far away
Thats mechanically complex and heavy, IRL it wouldnt have a mech connection
I thought that was one of the specific issues with the osprey? Loosing an engine was really bad
https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8e722189c126ce9ef88ee057f2702628-lq
oh yeah no they are linked
neat
not sure that works for a jet engine tho
it can sort landing with them partially rotated
VTSL
Vertical take off short landing
just perpetually hovering?
I mean you can infinitely AAR so
Some weapons are dlz locked, 161 might be one dunno
The DLZ is identical to the 26 one
The 120D and 120 have *nearly* identical performance
It’s somewhat dynamic
Just, inaccurately so
Yeah iv hit targets at 60nm
The regular 120 can do that as well
Well it *could* if the radar allowed for it
The 120D does have slightly better performance, but I don’t think it’s a super huge margin
The DLZ is a good reference, but not a gospel
Also against cold targets it will tend to over-estimate a bit
So if the target is running away from you make sure to wait until your closer than it indicates
Once the arrow is within the bar you should fire
In general, like mentioned above the DLZ is not perfect, it just takes time/experience to know when exactly to fire
Below the g indicator?
Yea aoa in degrees
It dosnt count lateral aoa, only vertical
You've got two main symbols there, the small empty circle is an acceleration indicator from a top down perspective, the line emitting from the center is your velocity from a top down perspective
In jets, we say put it at your 3/9 line because that is what makes your velocity perpendicular, given that the helicopter is capable of strafing technically tne very best way to notch is to point the nose of the helicopter at the missile, with your velocity vector 90 degrees off to either side
Landing isn’t a half bad strat either :risitas:
Yeah
:Think:
https://youtu.be/wfhRD8mTsiQ?t=85
I did the tutorials/simply missions just for the principle of it
I wanted to experience it the “intended way”
Well I hopped into an mp one first but
I mean this in the nicest way possible, skill issue
please don't
just
dont
directly away is equally as bad as directly towards
Yeah, the reason why chaff works when perpendicular is because there is no doppler return off your aircraft, so chaff and your aircraft are equal
when going towards or away from the radar, there is a large doppler shift, which it can use to filter out chaff
sea is less effective tho
Putting a mountain between you and the missile
Don't be somewhere with no mountains
most of the skill in BVR is positioning (the rest is information control)
*if* you get caught out in the open, try to notch (3/9 line), dive, and spam chaff
Do a high-G pull when it gets close
yeah
Also missing the enemy AWACS
AE
Airborne Warning And Control System
this thing
You have the E4 here
both
E4 is the allied
AE is the enemy
You can't, why would you need to?
Nah HARMs are for IADS, CAGMs for the SRAD, and JDAM for the tower
hence the CAGMs
CWIS/SRAD is far from perfect tho
You can kill a CWIS with a bomb
Plus consider that you can carry 31 JDAMs
nan
have to record them yourself
flight log will be in the root game director in a folder
everything is possible
@ierdna100 the flame actually produces heat which makes it harder to evade IR missiles
Yeah :risitas:
:thonkery:
*maximize* why?
you can
in the SMS page
but why?
fair enough, its not a great tactic tho
Uh
not really
or use your own radar lmao
its not visibility on radar
the TSD shows all data sources
including RWR
no really not
yeah
I use radar all the time in BVR
its all about information control
knowing when to turn it on
when to not
when was this made?
Looks new-enough to be after the bug was fixed
That quote makes it seem like its an A2A dogfight, in which case "max G" is probably rather low and you'll want to be all the way back on the stick
Im not 100% sure, but I *think* they either have no RCS, or very very low RCS
Yeah the weapon holder has three parts, the weapon, the clamp, and the pylon, the weapon and clamp both defiantly have RCS, but I think the pylon dosn't
thats what I think, but iv had some troubble actually verifying that, if they *do* add RCS its verrryyyy low, far lower than even the clamp
Its got a *decent* explosive power, how far away were the other targets?
The AGM-161 seems to have a shaped charge or something along those lines, while having a higher damage it has a far lower blast radius than a GBU-38
Twice the radius
about 40% more damage
yea thats way too far
the radius listed for the 161 is 25m
On a **9600k**
exactly, "less than what you want"
Im happy at 60fps, but the prefered would be at least matching my headsets refresh rate
if you are below your headsets refresh rate then its less than what you want for an optimal experience
Yeah 90 fps is the "target" for VR games/headsets
Where (in the past at least) 60 fps was the "target" for regular games
Now obviously with high refreshrate monitors you want to at least match the rate of your display
In VTOL? I havn't heard of anyone getting 120 in missions
:thonkery: I mean that could be said about *any* game that gets anything less than infinite FPS
baha has mentioned in the past the issue with doing optimizations is nearly nothing in the game is expensive
theres simply too many things going on, hundreds of scripts that each use fractions of a millisecond
THeres so many :Agony:
Ehhh the issue is VTOL has a *lot* of shit to manage, like mentioned above no one script is super expensive, its hundreds of smaller scripts that add up. FSX just has to simulate the physics per aircraft, which given that theres never more than your own aircraft is fairly light weight in comparison
TLDR BVR is all about positioning and information control, have an understanding of where you are,  and where you plan to be if a missile is shot at you, pre-plan your next step/next position and always leave yourself an "out". Maintain SA on targets as best as you can, make assumptions about where people will be, you know how fast these aircraft move, so if you know where someone was 15 seconds ago, you can guess at where they will be next. Have an understanding of your emissions, know where your radar cone is pointed and who is going to see you on the RWR. Use the F-45s interpolated track feature against it, intentionally manipulate when you are and aren't detected to lure players in specific directions to a *position* thats better for you.
Most of the time the missiles in vtol have no fucking clue where they are
Uhh iv not looked myself, from what C has said they are fairly reasonable in shape (ie similar to the 26) and their size tends to be comparable to the 26
33's are a lot smaller, but still larger than the 45
Iirc 33s are smaller RCS than 58s
58s are *massive*
they have so much surface area that it dosnt matter how stealthy it is it still reflects a ton (well its still smaller than the 26 but)
Baha mentioned he'll be looking into balancing changes to health and radar once the major bug fixes are out of the way so watch for that
fast af
Like it out runs a 26
Im not sure if it can go mach 2 ( I think it can), but it can go like 1.4 at sea level which is more than the 26 can do
think so, naval strike there are some bombers that travel low, fast af
PVP is *hard* to make a guide for
theres tibits and tricks sure
but every situation is unique
Ehhh its not a wall of difficulty its just practice
good way to learn is *every time* you die make a conscious effort to figure out "why did I die".
There's always a reason, theres always a mistake you made
try to identify that
Theres not
*all* of the f45s weapons are harms
If only the TSC would let us :sad:
it is annoying you cant fire at grounded aircraft
like I know the internal radar wont pick it up
but I also know they plan to take off in the next 30 seconds
and I want a 120 ready for them then :itsfreerealestate:
To who me or thenlar :risitas:
Oh
off in flight, all the APU does is produce electricity
145s should lock onto targets inteligently, so should be able to
:thonkery: altitude plays a massive role in range
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/319915885575798785/946063180948471918/unknown.png
slant range?
Good question, @C-137 created it so im not sure
:thonkery:
Who tf mdae it then
I mean I can just confirm 100% that altitude plays a huge amount into it
the atmospheric density changes per altitude, which means missile preformance changes quite a bit
the HARMs are DLZ limited (why???) which means the effect is less-so than other weapons
altitude is considered
It is considered, just incorrectly so
the DLZ is a *very* rough estimate, IE its using hard coded range values that are then "shifted"/modified based off your altitude delta/closure rate etc
Based off what? Iv seen it be extremly inacurate at both sea level and at 40k ft
Iv honestly seen the *most* change in the DLZ based off altitude
iv had the DLZ be so tiny as so that you couldn't see any of the bar just because I was below the target
maaayyybee
The time to impact code is extremly simple in comparison to the DLZ code
```cs Vector3 onNormal = estTargetPos - base.transform.position; float magnitude = Vector3.Project(rb.velocity - estTargetVel, onNormal).magnitude; float magnitude2 = onNormal.magnitude; timeToImpact = magnitude2 / magnitude; ```
```cs Vector3 onNormal = targetPosition - missilePosition; float magnitude = Vector3.Project(missileVelocity - targetVelocity, onNormal).magnitude; float magnitude2 = onNormal.magnitude; timeToImpact = magnitude2 / magnitude; ``` bit of a cleaned up version
I mean if the target dosn't manuver and the missile speed remains the same it will be perfectly accurate
Its why you see the number go down as you launch it, and the number go up (or slow down how fast its going down) when the target manuvers away
Yeah it dosn't
which imo is good as the missile velocity is hard to predict based off how much it has to manuver
yeah :sad:
eh of the mistakes you could make in pvp, trusting the DLZ is possibly the least of your issues
A missile fired at beyond DLZ range will almost never hit any player unless they are incompetent or just luck
Against players that don't know what they are doing lol
like yeah if they just keep hot flying straight at you you'll hit
if they defend, even a bit, itll miss
How would you even prove that? In a test like that, if I just turn around then the missile will never hit
You'd have to be really lucky to keep the lock the entire time, or I guess be *really* high, but being higher than like 25-30k ft has massive disadvantages even if you are going to abuse the aim-120s poor terminal accuracy
Hopfully baha buffs the terminal manuverability of the 120 to be akin to the super-missile cruisers
dual pulse?
ahh neat, thats not modeled but would be very good
That sounds exactly like waht I want 120s to behave as, keep range as is and over-all energy retention the same, but more maneuverable in the final phase
shut don't let baha hear that
he'll give it only to the 45 and we'll all be crying then
Nothing against you browning, but that takes litterly all of the skill and fun out of BVR and is a very very bad way to play. At least for me, the fun and skill of BVR comes from the tactics of positioning, knowing radar mechanics, knowing when to be agressive and when to hold back, information control etc etc, but all of that is thrown out the window when you can just fly at 15k ft flying in a straight line pulling back on the stick a bit when the missile gets near, and even worse when you can just look at the missile, press one button, and nothing else
Luckily, baha is going to nerf that soon with the G-damage, doing a maneuver like that will lead to your weapons breaking off
To G-pull over a missile you just need to pull the Gs for a moment, its not a sustained pull
there is *some* skill in G-pulling over a missile, but that + missile intercepting (which theres near zero skill in) means BVR if everyone did that would be just flying in a straight line at each other spamming missiles and not even trying to defend or avoid
missile intercept = need two missiles, RCS bug = now need 3, G pull means you need to space shots out correct, now you need 4
4 missiles for a chance to *damage* one target
effecting the pilot feels like it would be frusterating for gameplay ( thats a weird hard to tell effect thats going on and hard to communicate with the player)
Weapons falling off is instant feedback for a bad action which is good imo
> Unfortunately that can't be achieved until: I mean you *can* just choose not to abuse G-pull and missile intersept
Intercepting is fairly common sadly, but most players don't G-pull
ehhh the same could be said about something like the RCS bug
"hate the game not the player" abusing exploits is still an issue, I personally feel like G-pulling is an exploit, others disagree, but if a player is using an exploit thats a valid reason to "hate" them, I think it should be patched from the game, but in the meantime players shouldnt use it
I agree its a bit of a slipperly slope, but the same logic follows that if you found an exploity that for whatever reason made you have 3x the hp, it would be reasonable to say that users shouldnt use it until a patch comes out
Theres currently an exploit in game that with very little skill required makes most 120s go stupid, but obviously using that would be bad. Sure, its a design of the game that causes it but it shouldnt be a thing
Kinematic evasion IRL is not even close to how it is in vtol
Im not sure it was a specific design choice, we really can't know unless baha specifically says "yeah being able to evade every missile by pulling some Gs is fine"
baha has specifically said otherwise in fact
How EOTS = not BVR?
I guess because you can "see" them?
Visual != thermal
An IRST system is still BVR
Fair enough, I don't play DCS/BMS so my expectation of BVR includes the TGP/EOTS
ehh at least in the videos iv seen you have to defend quite a bit more than in vtol
Yeah INS for 120s pls 🙏
not that it matters with G-pull anyways :Think:
They’ll be super susceptible to defenses tho so be careful
8
assuming no other factors, such as notching and what not
basics are cringe bring out the simulations
Its not, once the lock is lost the missile is gone
the 120D on the f45 can, but not hte 26
nahh reaqureing can be left for the 45, but INS pls
*skill issue*
120s use identical radar code to all other radars in the game
All radars in vtol use the same logic/simulation
(Not counting the altitude radar, that is a simplified simulation aka just a line cast down)
The plane has two altitude modes, ASL and AGL
AGL tells you how far above the ground you are, which is done with a “”radar””
I mean it’s a checkbox baha could click on the missile :risitas:
Inertial navigation system
Let’s the missile maintain its course to tne predicted intercept point without help from the plane
Sorry I was AFK, I think the decision to not have INS is purely for balance, after all, the F45 has it and it works fine
How it should work is the moment radar contact is lost the missile uses the last known values for velocity and position, and from there the AIM-120 guides itself on that predicted point
F45 still has the advantage as it can update that last known even after the contact is dropped, where in the 26 once its dropped its on its own
they actually already have something called "INS backup" and do prediction for the target velocity, all that would have to change is telling them not to self destruct
the code is here, it just needs to be told not to self detonate
You can test it in the 45
`pos += vel * dt` works perfectly assuming the target dosn't manuver or change velocity at all
Why not?
`pos += vel * dt` is *the* equation of motion for an object that isn't accelerating, ie, for a non-accelerating target this *perfectly* predicts their location throughout time, this isn't about *guidance* its about knowing where the target will be in the future
If you perfectly know where the target is, dosnt matter if its radar or if its estimated using that equation
all the radar does is provide updates of position and velocity, that equation does the same but it assumes the target dosnt accelerate
Right we are talking about two different things, there is *guidance* ie taking known info about the target and figuring out how to intersept it, then there is that target info component. Normally the target info is given via the radar, but you can if you loose radar lock replace that target info with an estimation
Its an *estimate* as it dosn't take into account all factors as it can't possibly know what the other aircraft does, but assuming the other aircraft does nothing (aka no acceleration) then you can perfectly predict its location
Right the thing is you are talking about *guidance*
We don't care about the intercepting ship, the "missile", thats unrelated here
All we care about is the target
Don't consider guidance, guidance works the same with or without radar
Radar is a *source of target information* nothing more, so when we are talking about missiles hitting without that radar all thats changed is the *source of information*. Guidance is identical either way, that is to say, if the missile can hit *with* a radar, it can hit *without* a radar
Nooo guidence is still there, the point being consider only what changes. Look at a missile being guided via a radar, now look at a missile being guided via INS. What changed? Just the *source of information*, guidance remains identical
Consider the system as multiple isolated parts (because thats what it is), radar produces target information, guidance uses target information to produce commands, guidence stays the same
Right, but thats where teh *prediction* comes in
you run `pos += vel * dt` as many times as your computer will let you (so for vtol, once per frame all the way up to the target)
This creates those updates, that information is still being produced and sent
Curved path? Itll fly identical as it does with radar guidence
From an external perspective it dosn't appear to have changed at all
IRL they must fly like that as well, otherwise it would never hit the target
If you fly a perfect intercept point course, the target changing their heading will force a *massive* offset to be required
they use "lead time", that is they calculate an intercept point a specific number of seconds ahead of the target, it leads to a curved path but not a super curved path
Curved path makes it far harder to evade
Consider something like this, with a pure intersept point it flies like this, which gives it the most energy, however what happens when the target maneuvers, you are forced to do a **massive** change in direction
Also, it would make it trivial to lead the missile into the ground, or a mountain, or what not
with lead time while you do follow a curved path (less energy) you react to target manuvers *wayyyyyyyy* better
:risitas:
nah it does curved still as its not a pure-intercept path
its trying to intercept a point a few seconds in front of the object
and this is why
if it was pure intercept it would never hit at range
I don't have any, most of it is just from reading the game code
If you do find documentation about how it works IRL lemme know, but from what iv seen countries tend to not want to disclose how their missile guidance works :risitas:
Yeah, and my best guess is IRL they must do something simular
Or something completely different, who knows, but I doubt its pure-intercept for the reasons listed above
Yeah im reading about that rn, seems like its a common method
Thats where I first head about it, if the thing remains on a constant bearing but gets bigger, your about to die
yes
you can tell when something is about to hit you like that
Yeah but its the same consept, you won't be able to see the size difference sure but if something remains on a constant bearing, you have to be carful that its not about to hit you
Pilots are taught that to tell when they are on a collision course
Baha has the code for proportional as well as view angle however all missiles (few exceptions but they use a unique one) use the lead-time system
Must've given teh best results
he still uses lead time
Its likely that 5th gen can display such information, but, the amount of reaction time you have is so limited plus a missile is *very* small compared to an aircraft, the chance of it missing is wayyyyyy higher
amrams lack the manverability to do offboresight tho so should be fine
The seat auto-seperates iirc?
yeah that would do it :risitas:
the seats are not 0-0 rated
You think Boundless Dynamics cares about pilot saftey? Some of the missions have you out numbered 4 to 1
:risitas:
But yeah our ejection seats have a pretty narrow envelope
Indeed
I reported it as a bug a few times in the past
Well yeah but if baha fixed every tiny issue that was reported when it was reported he'd never get anything done :risitas:
Im sure it was added to the list
and even simple to fix things have a time cost for starting and stopping a task
Its also a *realllllllyyy* minor bug, pilot death dosn't matter in vtol
Ejecting is more for fun than anything
Also fun fact a bit of the reason why our ejection seats have a narrow envolope is that the plane after ejecting likes to do a massive pitch and hit the pilot
well specifically the 45
nan
nan
the single frame of plane
It’s also the MWS
Depends on their mood but yes
Is a helicopters
helicopters are hard
Having the TADS open at all times even when you have a gunner obviously has its advantages, but yeah the limitation adds fun
mark button isnt needed
MARK enables the visible laser, the invisible laser is always enabled yes
yes
where that list is?
No idea
oh its pinned
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rh2ZlxwtfRvLU1q3uzpQEoHefu8r5HnEGBO4AsEHv0Y/edit
the 4 main hardpoints on the helicopter can articulate up and down to assist with employing weapons
Holding combat collective and trigger?
No it lets you pylon tilt
Oh I missread what was being asked
With TADS as SOI, press the collective thumbstick in for 1 second, then press forward and backwards
Yeah you have to head track
Imo, thats a good thing
If you could manipulate TADS zoom as a pilot from HOTAS there would be practically no reason for a gunner
if you are over the target when you press the stick in itll lock directly onto the target
trigger + CMS button on combat collective
If you have a TADS malfunction then manual tilt is useful
Iv got 700 hours in this game and I still forget sometimes :risitas:
Engine start order dosn't matter, I always start the left first personally
Tho I start both engines at the same time, but I flick the left switch first
No im talking about the heli
You can run both starters at the same time provided you have enough electrical power
At least should keep it for the 94
theres actually a reason to have a cpg when you use it
Tis a helicopter, the massive spinning rotor puts a lot of force into it
you have to counteract that force with yaw inputs
you can trim it
The amount of trim required changes very dynamically, I don't use trim at all,  like smol said its not required
They don't need to be on the TSD, however there is a chance they could target the same thing
If you select via the TSD there is a *far lower* chance of them hitting the same target
"Auto" refers to the seaker uncage mode, in auto the seaker always tries to slave
Yes
nan
See its correct, its spelt seaker more often
I find that fact irrelevent
:risitas:
2-3 are internals yeah which is why required 2 or 4
just the mounting hardware
Sadly we won't get that
at least on the 42c
Baha mentioned he considered it, but it didn't make sense for a near-supersonic high altitude aircraft
its more about it dosn't make sense for that aircraft
nan
^
AAA is deadly, but has a terrible range
If you do wonder into AAA fire, wait till you see the muzzle flash then jink up/down
Fly straight while its not firing
If you must hit AAA with guns ( seriously, don't, just rearm) use TGP to get the gun predictor, then try to fire at max range, do a short run, don't get close than 1-1.5 nm then break away for another run
the moment it shoots, break the attack run off (if it shoots at beyond 1.5)
Make sure to fully break the lock before recommiting, the way AI seems to work is they retain a bit of knowledge about you and will be quicker to react again/will react at a longer range if they keep a lock/visual sight of you
so go farther than needed
~3nm
Transition slowly, don't go from 90 deg pitch to 0 instantly
The gun pipper indicates range, the ring around the dot is a range indicator
if its 100% full you are out of range
Yea
we have never dogfought lmao
I know you went 10-3 against temperz but that aint me
:Crycat: How did you know!
We have never had a guns dogfight
I was in the VC at the time you were fighting temperz
but my ign is "Chase", unless you used a diffent account name than KitKat we havn't fought
flight collective top button
I have a video of me panic toggling hover day 1 of the heli not realizin g im holding the wrong collective :risitas:
Flight collective, not combat collective
Its the flare button while holding combat collective
You can in settings
"toggle grip" can be disabled
To be fair I don't bring 92s just because they are annoying to click through
tho normally ill just disarm them
That sounds like someone abusing the fact that you can do a high-G pull once the missile gets close to dodge it
Def sounds like either missile interceptions or high-G pulls
the 26 can command any number of missiles per-target, up to 4 targets
No, the 26 can guide in TWS
only needs hard lock for launch
you can instantly unlock
Also FYI as this is a major change from how the game used to work. In PT, having a hard lock **will better let you maintain the lock** than just TWS
Ah
TWS still is better than pre-TWS tho so its a balance
But yeah fighting 45's won't be total agony anymore 🙏
It does
it effects all radars in the game
Yeah
Tracked gives a boost, locked gives a bigger boost
Initial inspection says the boosts are 2x and 4x, but need to do something extra to verify
Depending on range and other factors, yes
45s will have to be carful to not expose too much
Their "get out of jail free card" of pointing their nose at their target will no longer be nearly as effecitve
:stonks: Nice
Pre-pitbull yes
Post-pitbull the missile is own its own
Its applied to the reciever sensetivity
No inverse square law here
Wait no its still inverse square its just not uhh "inverse cubic"?
The logic is that from a signal processing perspective, it should be far easier to detect a target if you already have a pretty good idea of where they are
*slaps radar* this bad boi can listen so hard
I don't think it actually does
Mmmm dunno
as in, does the 45 automatically mark targets as TWS and get the TWS buff to radar strength
Yeah should be manual, even if its just say twsing the actively selected target
Id be happy with just single-target TWS for the 45
:thonkery:
my name only has a capital C because I went in and modified the file after a while of it annoying me lol
time to use pipe rather than l, I'|| do this from now on
Rockets are simple, master arm on, press trigger
Assuming it’s the only weapon you have, if you have others you might need to cycle through them to get to the correct one
Are you holding the stick?
What’s the weapon name
Hydra-70 and PGM-27s are the only rockets in game
Fun fact, the AIM-92s are the only LOAL capable IR missiles
PGM is a guided rocket
But it’s not a missile
Just to add to the confusion a bit
GBU-39ERs are gps guided with a rocket motor, but it’s neither a missile or a rocket, it’s a bomb
Just to sprinkle in some more fun
Size, burn time, and mounting
Yeah what I’m saying isn’t hard truth, it’s just the way I see it
PGMs are hydras with a guidance package strapped on
Also in reality I argue a GBU-39ER is an AGM (actually probably best described as a cruise missile)
low and fast
minimal
as low as physically possible
if ground level is 1300 ill be 1500 or below
Being low isn't the be-all-end-all
fox2 and fox3 are A2A missiles
They are not weapons to be used on SAMs
don't fox-2 incoming missiles
Or any other AG weapon
(guns, hydras, AGMs, cruise missiles, HARMs etc)
Its an inconsistent tactic that wastes missiles
Plus its a no-skill way to avoid missiles, might as well enable god mode tbh
Depends on the SAM/mission
AGM65s are great as they are more versatile and you can carry more
however, if I know I am fighting a long range system (4/MC) and I have no terrain then ill use HARMs
range
the AGM-88 HARM out-ranges nearly all other AGMs in game
and 89 yes
Roughly 60 nm
In a perfect world
Well in a vacuum
uh
infinite?
I have reasonable proof that baha's fuel has oxidizer mixed into it so
Well they burn for 5 minutes and at least the 89 visually has an intake so they def seem like jet engines
But, the intake must be for cooling only, the fuel has oxidizer in it
nan
F-45 RCS works underwater
that combustion is happening under water
therefore, must have oxizider built in
Additionally, no matter how high up you are the engine will not fail
Ooo thats a good question
Ill try to find a way to test that later
fucking *cring*
bahas trying to hide the truth from us
Its the thing above the TADS box on the bottom of your hud
shows you your slip
its basically horizontal AOA
TC might mean turn coordinator here?
Which, is roughly accurate
nan
Yeah
Dunno if it has a different name in regards with heli but the bottom part of this thing
:Think:
the ball means the actual indicator
the only circular one
the slip
nan
spins yes
it is not a ball
nor is it a circle
something that *moves in a circle* is *not a circle itself*
are the satellites orbiting the earth physical spheres because they move in a circular path?
am I a circle if I spin in place
:flooshing:
Valid point
its not
the regular aircraft don't experience uncommanded yawing forces so they don't need it
thats commanded forces
just
dumb ones
Its a big vtol group that runs weekly events
:flooshing:
irony
Want to put that to the test?
Ill be free mostly in the evening tomorrow
Well ok I didn't mean *now*
true
im just not a huge fan of people randomly claiming "yeah guys im pretty good" :risitas:
Fight me rn ierdna :Floosh:
Im one of the admins of CAW-8, you said you were better than them so
Luckily the abusable bugs that I know of at least have been fixed
theres a few abusable *features* but
Only the 26 can't
all others can
Yea
if you had a steep enough cliff ofc you could but thats not "taking off from the grass" lmao
I really wish that mod worked
Iv seen a 26 do a cobra
Well
Almost
It was a partial cobra
Not the really nice one you can do in the 45
https://streamable.com/7iz85j really good video of it from baconism
One or two
One is definitely missing
Another one possibly damaged
But a plane that becomes *more maneuverable* after it gets into a bad situation seems pretty good to me
The correct technique for hitting tanks in cities
Nah it was a 145
TPOD can lock at 25 and can view out to 30-35
Missile launch uses teh same sensors as the MWS system
MWS includes two warnings - Proximity close range warning - Launch warning
The radar scans in a 10 degree arc, the radar elevation is relative to the horizon where the radar should point
you only want positive elevation if you want to radar scan something above the horizon
Yeah its basically the same as when against SAMs
The tactics around offensive/defensive positioning are a bit different ofc, but for avoiding the missile itself the same principles are in effect
A missile is a missile no matter what you are in
the 94 specifically is *really* good about breaking line of sight
nan
It does not
:risitas:
Why tf would it only happen on the 45
Yep, the best way to avoid missiles is not to get shot at
thats step 0
True for all aircraft, especially for the 94
You can use any
Intuition says velocity, but I could be wrong
sometimes things in vtol get majic intel on targets they shouldnt
65s are far larger than 114s
nah, at least in game they are totally different weapons
nan
In general my rule of thumb, "flaps for what you need", the heavier you are or the slower you want to go, then more flaps
Flaps are good in BFM as well, but what I meant was for a takeoff, use as much flaps as you need
If you are a "normal" weight, use 1, if you are super heavy, use two (I always use two as it gets me into the air the quickest)
It has em
just it manages em automatically
In the 94, audibly say the words "For fucks sake hes right in front of us just fucking lock him" and it typically works for me
callout fox-1 when you fire an ammram
Just bad callouts in general is good :risitas:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rh2ZlxwtfRvLU1q3uzpQEoHefu8r5HnEGBO4AsEHv0Y/edit
Im untrusting, even when ppl make callouts I flare :risitas:
Never know when some dumbass has bad IFFed
all 4 of us
:waah:
im looking for joe
well
we might get touchscreen
Tho we dunno what exactly it will do
Yeah
Code related to TSD drag has been in for a while but baha mentioned hes working on it
so maybe
yes
`MFDPTacticalSituationDisplay`
Just ping him?
@C-137
The way it works is the tgp just tells the missile where to look with its optical sensor, once it comes off the rail its trying to find what you had your tgp pointed at
which means even if its pointed not directly on a target, it can find it
mmmmm I disagree with that, I keep at 100 a vast majority of the time, specific hard turns or hovers are of course different but most of my combat is done traveling quickly
Even pvp I stay full power a lot unless im making a turn
ofc in a city I make a lot of turns
but
Imo good rule of thumb is its fine to stay at full power as until you need to do a hard turn
FFARs?
Hydras?
You just point the redial onto the thing you want to die
how "full" the ring in shows range
If it is full you are out of range
Anywhere less than full is in range
The DLZ dosn't indicate burn out distance
THe hydra burnout happens nearly instantly, they get thrust for a very very short amount of time
For the PMG it is 1.1 seconds, not sure about hydra
Hydras are 1.1 as well
Well if the ring disappears that means you are 0m away from the target so technically not wrong :risitas:
Actually the ring might vanish at 100m hmmmmmmm need to figure this out
Not really
But the closer you are, the more accurate you have to be to ensure a hit as it has less time to manuver to impact target
The launch range calculator assumes a minimum safe range of 800m, but im 95% sure you can fire beyond parameters
I know for a fact iv launched beyond max-range so im sure you can
Assuming that its fired close enough and in the correct location that the MWS can detect it, yes
25301 kca for the F/A-26b
So we've got three different answers so far
oh I did for the F/A-26b
ofc not
Air resistance isn't included here, the value I gave is just the potential energy of the 26b moving 200knots
so air resistance isn't a factor
Itll potentially be slamed into your house if you keep up
and like 56 minutes with full fuel
yeah
the engines draw 1.5 fuel
whatever that means
Prob `fuel draw rate * current thrust`
its `fuel draw rate * throttle setting (0-100)`
AB draws 3x fuel
thats per-engine
Max fuel load is around 20k
Yeah
Nah once its failed its gone
Id love aircraft issues and solutions to them, however the simplicity of VTOL dosn't really work well for that
thats not a failure tho
actually
wait
theres totally a way to start the engines after a failure
Assuming that you run out of fuel along a flight path that brings you close enough to the tankers boom, it should be fully possible to run out of fuel (engine failure), get more fuel, then start
I will be attempting this tomorrow
I only need a few litters to start the engines
so as long as I get on the boon for a moment im fine
its not a meme
VTOL has three types of engine failure
- Flame out due to low OX - Flame out due to low fuel - Mechanical damage preventing function
Im not sure about low OX, but low-fuel engine failures can be restarted from
I want to but they’re no way to do it in vtol sadly
game only loads the music once right?
so you'd only be able to shuffle on load
ah
so you could create a virtual file that you provide the data to via an external program
Actually i bet you could then connect spotify and other things to it
If its not an MP mission theres no way to do it coop
Quicksave/load helps a lot
mod?
what would it do
ah lol
If you do, make it save multiple quicksaves so you can go back more than the previous
Its not that hard!
quicksave0.cfg quicksave1.cfg quicksave2.cfg quicksave3.cfg and then just a "go back" button on the MFD
That would ruin the immersion
Its far better to spend 50 hours developing an extremly niche program
Its basically a rule that software devs are required to spend 2 weeks automating something than can be done in two hours
kek
Yeah they have LOAL, the tads can "point" at something behind a mountain
If you don't have line of sight, you'll see a LOAL indicator
its a small redial pointed forwards, it flies in that direction until it spots the target
yeah
Exactly, and you can use the radar to do that
nan
:risitas:
Iv recently been trying to somewhat orginize it
it became impossible to find anything in a folder with 350 video files
My "unclipped" folder
I used the radar to detect the target over the hill (radar is high on the top of the heli so you can use it to peak), then I press the "SLAVE" button to put the TADS onto it
Yeah, the GPS-S button
:thonkery: I had my interior light on
TADS field of regard or Rectangular Turret Indicator
54 was active
Right?
Yeah it’s active
Guns
Yeah that’s why it was so spook especially for the time, no lock warning, just suddenly a 100kg explosive charge drops in from the heavens and disintorgrates your wing man
:Think: Just because they move the definition of "long range" dosn't change the fact that modern missiles are insane
AIM-120D - 86nm
Thats *very long range*
lower collective
you're over torquing the helicopter/getting RBS
just lower collective and itll fix
lower collective when in high-stress/high-torque situations
and you'll avoid it
you can audibly hear when it starts to happen
as RPM will dip
Mission locked munitions have been in for a long time, but iirc all the 26b missions let you use any weapon
it won't target *sunk* ships, but the ship dosn't need to be moving
Rotors taking damage can put torque into the engine
Possibly? Let me see if I can find a clear answer
Yeah I dunno, from what I can see over-torque dosn't apply damage
That fix was in relation to STTing someone, the un-STTing them into a TWS mode
It was bugged so that the missile will go stupid, now it will continue to guide on tws
But, that’s also in relation to the 45 which works differently
The game dosnt explain the differences between the two missiles, but they are extremely different in how they work, the bug was happening to the F45, not the 26
There is one missing hud ICON which is the octagon thing, but you really shouldn't rely on the HUD elements for hover
I recommend practicing hover with HUD off
Practice going between different spots, slowing, hovering, then going to another spot
I dunno what its actually called
"naval missiles" do you mean the AGM-89s?
AGM-89s are GPS guided initially, you shouldn't be trying to use the radar
Use the TGP (or nav map) to create a GPS point on the boat, then fire
Ill check, but should be around 60 nm
I don't have a good way to check rn, but I am actually willing to bet its closer to 80nm
They have 4 minutes of fuel, im not sure how fast they normally travel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQI8fbYpl7o
Actually it isn’t render that limits them, otherwise you’d not get RWR pings and multiplayer wouldn’t work at all, baha just decided they shouldn’t be able to engage too far out so they have a hard coded max range that they are allowed to fire at
They are at least mach 1 :Think:
Mach 1 at sea level is fast af
If you are super light I find flaps 1 to work better
Flaps 2 means you need to get down to 160 or lower to manage an 8 AoA, which I sometimes struggle to keep fine control at
Flaps 1 at 180 knots typically works well for me
But, thats only if you are light
TWS works
you get a TWS boost as well
its just not as good as STT
You answered your own question, it’s a helicopter
That’s what they do
thats by definition what a fox-3 is
Only a missile on the radar? :Think:
:risitas:
as opposed to attacking what?
radars are basically always better to hit than launchers
88s are great as well
For naval strike I use two AGM-88s for the intial two DS's, then GBU-39s for the 2x MAD-4 on the docks
Ohh wait you mean the SP one
For that I fly directly over the lake
I ignore it
I never get close enough to it to have it be an issue
ye
then I use 39s to hit the mine boats
das me
Most recently at the 391st in Mountain Home
Ha nice
:thonkery: message delet
Fair enough, ill DM you
Don't fly straight at the target, use mountains/cover
More choice in gameplay/mission design dosn't really seem stupid imo
No
they are just worse
Not really
114s are way more fun to use
having to hold the laze is great
But yes if the mission gives you the choice of the two ofc use the 145
Its the same thing with AIM-9 vs AIRS-T
It can be fun to use a less capable weapon
Locking logic was changed with the ah94 release, it seems like its probably possible to lock people on the ground
The radar has a 15 degree vertical cone, elevation sets the angle its pointed in relation to the horizon
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/319915885575798785/968219345635381258/unknown.png
Elevation controls where this green line is pointed, if you set it to 0, the line will point right at the horizon
Any negative value
default is -7 (im guessing -7.5 rounded), which puts it so the top of the radar cone points right at the horizon
Well technically, if you are below the terrain feature you care about you can set it positive
and if the feature you care about is close below you you may want to make it less than -7
Sometimes when im fighting in a city I lower it a few degrees
but for 95% of cases, -7 is good
np
Nah its true horizon locked
Nah otherwise the radar map would never look stable
Pre-1.3.6p6 *all* radars were horizon locked
But then >    - Changed F/A-26B and F-45A radar scan to align with nose since horizon-relative elevation is not adjustable
200knots is fast
Really fast for flaps 2
It should be 8 degrees aoa, 3 degrees glide slope, so nose up to 5 degrees
Go slowly, give yourself a lot of distance to line up, make sure launch bar is down ofc
You're actually a bit in front of the wheel luckily
fly with flight assist off
then come back
only if your bad
he's talking specifically about the *test pilots* not the general people
they have a flag to not trigger MWS
Yeah
all weapons other than rockets are "missiles"
nan
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/343253364081033226/933849671896543272/unknown-212.png
Opponent radar type matters a lot
Fun fact, you can LOAL GBU-12s over mountains
:Think: how are you bombing things 25nm away
then your wings rip off
Ah
but they do
As of 3 minutes ago
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/972140157161574440
Comon thenlar get with the times
Yeah I wanna try a 30 bomb drop that way :risitas:
prob sadly
clients can see em
Yea lol
Obviously the closest missile is the biggest threat, but if dodging one puts you in a really bad position for another you'll still die, so its all situational
you always need to consider the "next step"
Iv done this many times in dynamic lib
Long mission + lots of units means when im landings is when im least focused bcs its the short break between combat :risitas:
I don't typically hover to hit tanks tbh
easier to just line up with the city grid
The 26 is very capable to fight with the 45 now
The 45 is obviously still generally better, but mixed lobbies still are fine
I’m not saying it’s better than the 45
But better heat seekers, more thrust, better energy retention and high weapons payload still means it’s quite good
Especially when it’s 45s and 26s working together
Fair, it’s easier to be good at the 45
Take a meh 26 pilot vs a meh 45 pilot and the 45 will by a massive margin
That was my point
Well uh the 145s can’t sink carriers
Carrier is the only boat that *cant* be sunk with 145s
Carrier g damage when
They feel nearly as easy as the other boats just need a different weapon tbf
Fun fact, in dynamic lib zone B you can fire from the heli pads into the city/boats
Yea lol
The airfield is extremly close to everything else, but elevated above everything else
So that+pylon tilt = fun
raygun/buddy spike are useful
raygun = im locking someone, might be friendly  buddy spike = hey friendly you've locked me
Typically its done like -> I see target, I lock it and call raygun -> buddy hears "raygun" then gets a lock immediately after, so calls buddyspike -> I realize iv locked a friendly (or maybe I knew but wanted stats) so unlock/don't shoot
More useful irl where iFF is harder, but in vtol its still nice to not freak people out when you lock them
wiki does
Range depends on speed/altitude, PGMs are *roughly* 3nm, but the DLZ will tell you if you are in range
the PGM is a fun weapon, but not typically the *best* option
If you think your target will turn itll be good
Would be nice of AI could change speed semi-regularly to throw off gun shots
range isn't the issue imo, its time of flight thats the problem
I don't believe they have ripple
they are laser rockets, you only should fire two or three per target lol
It should work, the fuel is pumped acrossed under pressure to increase flow rate, and the aircraft fuel system is designed to work under negative G
Well in game its a boon refueling system
but yes
you can
nan
^
F/A-26b?
26, 45, 94
the 94 is 94 for both teams
nah allied is 94 as well
Was it AH at one point?
My version of the game export says its AH
Its something weird, lemme find it
The aircraft has a `PerTeamRadarSymbol` script on it
For the 26/45 its on the MPSyncs object
I don't have an export of the 94 so I can't check
nah
my export is old
huh
weird
depends on your speed and altitude
the DLZ will tell you when you are in range
Probably, but, theres only three ways to fail, damage, fuel, or ox
O2
If you send your player.log I can look through
Did this happen right at the end or did you respawn a few times after?
kk
the torque system is fairly complex but I didn't *think* it would cause more damage
Yeah I can't tell from the log
He did
Roll problem or yaw problem?
It’s not possible to turn it off, unless you destroy it
So, obviously I know they are mechanically linked theres zero way they could hit, but just, looking at it it looks like such a bad idea :risitas:
Don't be at 100% collective for manuvers
Back
You can't fly and gun fully at the same time in the front
And, there are some controls only hte back has
Tldr you can't
Making them overshoot works
but
once someone is behind you
you are normally fucked
Velocity
Dosnt matter where the nose is pointed, just matters where the aircraft is
:flooshing:
I just got the new PCBs so much better buttons soontm
once I get it assembled
ye I got them working
not in that video thats the old one
Yeah
im printing new parts rn
Yeah I got the IO expanders hooked up to it
And all the buttons soldered on
Yeah thats 1/4th of it
I just gotta make 3 more
Ill do something, havnt decided yet
Video still dosn't work tho lol
Weapons in VTOL don't have a set range
it all depends on your altitude, your opponents altitude, your speed, their speed, and aspect
You can hit 50-60 mile shots reasonably
Even more in some cases
Ehh 25-30 range is reasonable for a regular BVR encounter
if your opponent is nose hot, and at least 20k ft, and you are at least 20k ft you can hit 60nm
I wouldn't call it "effective", but its doable
it would but it gets up to mach 4 and above 20k ft the atmosphere gets nice and thin
It wouldn't be going mach4 when it got there, mach4 is what it tops out at
then it starts bleeding speed on the way in
by the time it makes it to the guy, its pretty slow
In a 1v1 I still quite often go cold, but only when I am low and have terrain to use
Typically I go cold to reposition/pull my enemy into a worse position where terrain is not as favorable to them
:thonkery:
manpad dies in one boolet
and manpad missile is fooled by one flare
:thonkery: just bcs its on the wiki dosn't mean its offical
Also "GBUs can steer towards a GPS point but do not have sensors to identify and track a target" :Think:
Me when the GBU-12
Me when the GBU-53
Well according to that the 12 and 53 are GPS guided so :thinkening:
:waah:
:justright:
I like using https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges and just checking over that
Practice is the big one, especially for a hover you'll want to go slowly, make small movements, if needed lower joystick sensitivity
Try practicing hovering over a spot, then translate to another spot, slow to a stop over it, then repeat
Meh radar fov big, boat is slow
It can
but you'd have to manage to fly in front of it while its searcing before it locks a target
Its `AS` for anyone wondering
RWR's won't show STT unless you are the thing they are locked onto
Fov is the same as the 26, 60deg, range is really low. I can't tell *how* low because thats not how radars work but its small
but, boats have pretty big RCS iirc so
Also for some reason it can see missiles?
nan
The boat itself would have to fire chaff
Chaff from other objects won't effect, only the target being locked
Yeah
Yeah idk if that would *ever* be practical :risitas:
But it would come with a nice performance hit
nan
:flooshing: locked onto by an anti-ship cruise missile
They do lead their targets
Currently AGM-126's are actually OP because they lead so well
:Think:
They are meant to be fired at moving
SAAW's and boats
nan
Yeah its the low refresh rate that is suposed to make it reasonable
however there is something funky rn with them getting better refresh rate than they should
rWR is the correct abriviation :Think:
Its a class instance so first letter is lower case, rest of the letters are equal to what they would be in the class
No because then you have ``` class RWR {}  const RWR = new RWR() ```
All lower case is also valid
rWR or rwr either work
:Think: all upper case is wrong
I’ll do some testing today to see if I can recreate it
If it’s accumulating position over time, and has perfect velocity that would be enough right?
Ah right
Weird
There's not currently, but it was discussed a bit https://canary.discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/319916002702000129/978339591780204634
EOTS at least limits the range and requires some user action to use
Ehh stationary targets can get quite accurate for the RWR locating
Yeah
the 35's radar is LPI, plus getting an RWR ping means it can specifically control the strength/direction of its emissions to range a target
But please dear god never LPI for vtol
good
I wouldn't be against requiring a ranging ping
Something manually triggered, and *does* show up on the enemy rwr for a moment
EW aircraft that counters 45 pls :isforme:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/622107546085359616/978524117491925023/unknown.png here you go
Its not a mod :itsfreerealestate:
yus
45 > 26 > EF111 > 45
wait
I tyoped that wrong
wait no
I typed it correclty
its just confusing
no :bob_gun:
:Think: he'd make bank with any multicrew aircraft
A swept wing two seater, f-14 or not will sell like crazy
meh itll be straight forward *enough* with any two seater aircraft
bcs then you can mod the two seater rather than developing custom multicrew
Das ez
:Think: hmmmm
maybe for nav the other guy gets a simplified version
or maybe baha can re-use some of the calcs of your nav
with the exception of nav, it shoulnd't be *too* bad I would think
thats the dream end goal of the project im working on
AGM-88s are great for long range shots for SEAD
Wum?
Like, flight controls or somthin else?
Low and fast
Use terrain for cover
It works *best* pre-initial spike
If you didn’t need VR controllers at all, it would be fine
The PTB update argument has quieted down quick find another topic
It just auto-locks whatever is in front of it
Pressing the regular lock button will make it unlock if it’s locked onto a target
Just glance at it
It autolocks
It has equal range to your regular radar
Or when you know the bandit is about to cross over a mountain, you can pre-fire on them
Not in PTB
That too
Its what real pilots say!
not in ptb
Half the time when an update comes to PTB it completly breaks the game
Baha specifically said he tries to keep PTB updates short, typically they last a month or two before coming onto stable
The current PTB has only been going for 20 days
Not really? It would be poor to tell new players advice that will be outdated in a week or two
also if you are talking about this, he litterly asked about the ptb updates
so :shrug:
Yeah the alternative to having a ptb would be to have to wait 2 months for a buggy unabalanced patch to come out
then wait another two weeks for a fix for that
“Evasive” is “defensive”, same thing basically. When someone says “evasive” they might mean specifically aircraft maneuvering to defeat a missile but it’s semantics meaning tne same thing
The left stick is the primary
Its what you use to control sensors
You use the TSD to command AIM-120s
Tactical situation display
Shows all data the aircraft knows from any sensor on the same screen
You don’t need the radar on to fire missiles, but yes it’s worth using
You have to have data *somehow* on a target
If nothing else is picking it up, you may need to turn on your radar
No one plane, roughly the F-18 and F-15
with parts of an F-22
Correct
Sadly
It’s being limited to the AIRST in the text update
Have you enabled the radar, selected the target on the TSD, and enabled "POINT" mode?
but?
@pipekr is likely the best person to answer. At the end of the day, the AH-94 is a fictional aircraft, so its not trying to replicate any IRL aircraft, but it does a good job of being a semi-realistic heli simulation
I do like 89s tbh, especially given that boats take multiple of the smaller AGMs to kill
and carriers specifically need either 89's or a bomb of some sort
Rockets can't sink carriers
mmmm maybe, my export of the game (which is nearly 6mo old now) does say 145's can sink carriers
it would take 5 145s tho
Possibly a bug, but I swear iv seen dozens of 145s do nothing to carriers more-recently
Im planning to get a fresh game export soon so ill check then
But rockets defiantly can't, they do 80 damage but the carrier requires at least 100 damage to do any
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLWW-bbyfJEuQnnMmhSoCq39m3Ge5fxL11G_qbVDd88/edit#gid=2059608664
Damage values ^
I can probably make an export for the unit HPs/thresholds
nan
@Skumby ^
OpFor and allied have identical health stats
You started 71 minutes ago, it would be an issue if you didn't suck
do the tutorials
Oh yeah I miss read a number
there are two weird things going on
Allied carrier has 150hp min damage, enemy carrier has 100 min damage
And second weird thing, PGMs do 80 damage, hydras must do more but because the game dosn't count them as a "missile" I dunno how much
Hydra does 100damage @ 25m, PGM does 80damage @ 25m
The other stats they share are the same, hydra is a big lighter, dunno why PGM does less damage
Both should do 80 imo, rockets shouldn't sink a carrier
amazing
For carriers? 600
it does twice the damage of a hydra
14x the thrust and burns nearly 5x as long
nan
Fact that hydras can sink the enemy boats prob makes them OP AF lmao
Guess you gotta be pretty close
but still
There’s nothing illegal with claiming you have classified info on a made up plane
I mean there are plenty of games that claim to have “classified” or “restricted” documents
If "they" was a company/orginizaion it would prob be different, given that the manual was created by a kid I doubt the US gov will take the effort to track down and sue him :risitas:
uh
eyeballs..?
Oh
ARAD page press "HUD"
Carful with the high-G pull, in the next update to teh game your wings will rip off from too many g's
EQUIP, select the AIM-9, switch seeker mode to head tracked
the video linked is useful
yes
notching is putting the missile 90 degrees off your flight of path ("3/9 line") and having terrain behind you as to confuse the radar
You're in a fighter, you just turn to 90 degree angle
you want to bleed the missiles energy, do this by making it travel farther, making it turn, and making it go through thicker atmosphere
VTOL dosn't simulate the total loss of lift caused by seperation of airflow, but you will notice the flight controls stop having a meaningful input, your ability to manuver drops a ton, and the lift is reduced
the [STALL WARNING] dosn't *really* mean you've stalled, it means you are pulling greater than 18 aoa
Yeah its not about speed, its about AoA
now, slow speed means any manuver requires higher AoA
which is why when slower, its easier to get teh stall warning
:Think: how did you have that that fast
:risitas:
The instant reply lmao
its also listed on your HUD, next to the G-read out
AoA is measured in degrees (as you can see from the diagram), its (normally) always going to be some positive angle, if the positive angle gets too high, you stall
AoA is listed here on the HUD
faster = lower AoA
slower = higher AoA
yeah
AoA, speed, drag, lift, acceleration all are related to each other, as one change, all the others change
Is there a specific reason you are afraid of the stall?
VTOL aircraft don't really "stall"
Just don't pull as hard on the stick
the more you pull, the higher the AoA
modern fighters have side stick
but yes, in teh OPTION MFD
Be higher, be faster, be closer
those are the primary ways to make a 120 more deadly
Is it because you loose lock, or because they just seem to doge them?
You could try on PTB, ARMs have been somewhat buffed there
When im doing PVE I typically do AG, so im not hugely familiar with AI air and how well they defend
Ah hm maybe the PTB updates to buff chaff/notching work *too* well with the AI
Iv put a suggestion in #public_testing, I can defiantly see what your describing as being an issue with how well AI can beam
Yeah
My guess is they are unrealistically perfect at holding a 90 degree beam
Which also makes chaff OP
120s and 120d's have nearly identical stats
120d only gets a *tiny* bit more thrust in the beginning (8%) and a *bit* of a maneuverability increase (15%)
Mmmm when did you test? The notching/chaff updates are fairly new
It could also be that the 45 is better at not being fooled by chaff pre-pitbull due to the track files
“This” is a wonderful word but also the cause of some issues
“This” could lead to ambiguous situations where you don’t know what specifically is being talked about
I’m sorry :risitas:
Chaff works against SARH as well, honestly what I recommend doing is listing each missile, explaining what it is/what fires it, and ranking how difficult it is to dodge. Then, you can talk about missiles in categories. Its easier to explain "SARH missiles are easily fooled by briefly breaking line of sight" than by saying the same thing for each type of missile
For SARH you are fighting two things at the same time
You are fighting the radar (breaking los, chaff), and you are fighting the missile (bleeding energy, kinematic evasion)
Actually, its better to say you are *always* fighting two things
the missile, and the radar
for SARH, the missile and radar are always two different things
for ARM, the missile and radar start separate, then merge into one at the point of pitbull (or when the original radar is defeated)
The advantage of the heli is its very good at staying low/weaving in/out of mountains, being slow and low its also very good at notching
In vtol, it notches in a hover, rotors don't have an effect
it is
160 what speeds
knots?
Nothing particular changes, its a heli, the faster you go the higher the chance you get retreating blade stall
At high speed, when you try to manuver you need to lower your collective
Don't over trim, you shouldn't ever need right trim tho
the faster you go, the less trim you need
I personally don't use trim, because the required amount changes from moment to moment
The faster you go, the less trim you need
As the areo effects over the heli become more prenounced
so the torque effect is counterected without need for active input
IRL the same applies
One time setup: Switch to PTB, go to EQUIP -> AIM-120 -> enable it.  Fire: Switch to AIM-120 -> Hold trigger for one second
It means the missile is totally on its own for the entire flight. One second after launch, it enables its internal radar and searches for targets within a 30 degree cone
It will lock onto the first thing it sees (no IFF, be carful)
Until it finds a target it flies in a straight line
No datalink, no TTI, no way to guide it after launch
No because a fox2 is locked into it’s target before being fired
If you don’t have a radar lock
Maybe you know where a stealth jet is, but can’t lock it
Or maybe you know someone is about to go over a hill
Or maybe you know what direction someone will go in
In a fight I caught someone by locking them, firing, then taking a guess at which direction they would defend in and firing that way
They defended right into the path of the maddog missile
Yeah, it will show as a red M without a circle around it
So it can also be used to discourage someone from going somewhere
Smoke trail is obvious + rwr pings, makes them less likely to go in a direction
A low energy 120 can be really annoying even if it’s not deadly due to it limiting where you can go (limiting where you can go *can* be deadly)
Not at all lmao
You’ll kill way more friendlies than enemies for one
And none of the missiles will have any energy
Range indicator on stable branch is going to be quite inaccurate, the one on PTB does better, but effective range is really going to be situational. Theres situations where the effective range is 200nm
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/429501682670370827/981559488547016735
Altitude, speed, closure rate, how your target defends etc etc
All will effect the range extremely drastically
30-40 if you are both high could reasonably hit
Depends on the competency of the other guy
He waits to defend until he gets the pitbull rwr warning, good chance he will die
I get kills at that range decently regularly
Now if he cranks and goes into thicker atmo, less likely
But, long range shots have the importance of forcing people to defend, lower and slower is worse for taking long range shots
There's no AH-94 document specifically, the weapons are nearly identical to other aircraft, id recommend practicing flying around solo to get a feel for what good weapons employment feels/looks like
You'll see an aiming cue on your hud, its a circle with the word "LOAL", point that over the mountain and fire
Ah94 is hardest, AV-42c is the simplest systems wise, and is probably the easiest to fly, the 26 is also super simple
Looks don’t mean anything, it’s got the fewest and simplest systems
Oh
I miss read what you said
45 is 5th gen, it’s by definition BS
Not really
It’s systems are the most complex
But it’s also extremely powerful
Not broken, but it’s easier to do good
@KitKat what does forkandknife mean
You always react with it
:angery:
Yeah it’s easy to fly
The *system* is the most complex
Understanding track files/data sources, predicted tracks, how they can be miss leading, how to use that to your advantage, understanding your RCS from aspects and how to push stealth, knowing when and how to turn your radar on, coordinating targets/tracking with the eots etc etc
Which as aircraft, except for the 94 we have exceptionally good fbw
So it’s not noticeable in the 45 for vtol compared to the other aircraft
Fly by wire
You’re still flying a fighter, the system/controls are meant to reduce workload as much as physically possible but it’s still exceptionally complex
The pull on stick, plane goes up has been massively simplified, but that’s far from “sit back and relax”
For the 35 auto trim wasn’t the big revolution
The big revolution is the fact that you can yank the stick all the way back, and the aircraft dynamically uses every control surface to achieve what you want, while adhering to every physical constraint, all without the pilot to need to monitor or do anything
35 = IRL, 45 = in game
In game system does somewhat the same, but it’s easier as the only real physical constraint we worry about is over-G
There’s relatively little sudden/strange flight regimes, nothing like what exists IRL. And our stalls are extremely gentle compared to IRL
There is some strange induced/uncommanded roll that exists with high-yaw actions in the 26, but the control system handles that for you
It’s none of them
Like you said, it’s made up of those 3
Uhhh
None of them?
It’s not like the 35-45 relationship
It’s a totally unique airframe that is inspired from the 18/15/22
It’s got 5th gen flight controls with 3.5gen systems
It’s missing a SIT/TSD which are fairly important 4th gen systems
Tho I guess it’s really just early 4th gen, and the NAV is basically a SIT
Irl 4th gen have fire-on-DL, TSDs, target with TGP etc etc
Yea
DL is datalink, the way the 45 can shoot at a track file basically
The TSC is typically referred to as having a “database” of targets, any contact becomes a file in that database, hence “track file”
TSC = tactical situation controller, which is what we normally call the TSD
Yeah technically the TSD is only the display/interface
The TSC is what everything talks to, including the TSD
Yeah
the limiter is static 10g always
Yeah empty means it will hit if target remains on current course
Full means it will hit even if target maneuvers
Long range shots force the enemy to defend however
Missiles are tools you use to control the fight, they don’t have to be used to always get a kill, they can be used to get into a better situation to get the kill
Well step one, don’t be head on to the missile
You’ll want to turn away in any other direction
You don’t
Maddog is a last resort option
It’s terrible and very unlikely to hit
:Think:
I find that extremely unlikely
Unless there is confused terminology
The F45s don’t fire maddog missiles
So if you were being hit by missiles without being locked that’s why
No
That means an AIM-120 has switched to its internal radar and is looking for its target
Both regular and maddog missiles do that
No
Well
AIM-7 has uses
9E is fine if it’s the only option
The low-tech PvP strike mission only lets you use it
Already exists
Low-tech PvP strike
Iv asked for vertical scan but sadly it’s only forward
yea?
Thats the point lol
Have to try to hide from the SAMs using stealth
you aren't being as stealty as you think
you need to only have internal weapons, and keep your nose pointed at the radar
the nose/front is the stealthiest aspect by far
Dirt is the same as mud
“Mudspike” “mud” “dirt” all mean a ground based radar is locking you
Or scanning you, one of the two I dunno
Ah yeah so dirt is ping, mud is lock
Ye
Beam
As accurately as possible
Beaming is flying 90 degrees off from the missile
Notching is doing that, but with terrain behind you
Nah that’s still beaming, your just using chaff to try to confuse the missile
No that’s just going cold
Beaming is 90 degrees
Cranking is 60
Yes but it’s small
There’s no flameout altitude in vtol
At 40k, the 26b maxes at 1.1k knots
The 26 can climb upwards of 65k, but I don’t believe it can maintain level flight there
I also wouldn’t be surprised if the av42c had the highest top altitude
Iv cruised at 40k before, it’s engines produce stupid high trust and the flaps produce a ton of lift
Maybe the altitude curve is super aggressive so you can’t get much higher than that, I haven’t tried
Not that iv heard/seen, @Temperz87 with your fresh export what’s the current RPM?
Old values
Yeah lmao
There was a mission where I was using the AV basically to fill a heli role and I think I ran out
That mission is kinda funny because once the long-range SAMs are out, the strat is the AV hover/circles the city just deleting things from 15k ft out of range of all the defenses
heat is basically just point and click, put the redial over your enemy, pull the trigger
For radar, slew the cursors over your enemy, press once to TWS them, press again to STT them (should see green line), pull trigger to fire
Luckily the AH-94 can
I mean you can hardlock with an AIM-120 as well
Pitbull *is* a hardlock yes
So it gets the same lock advantage
https://streamable.com/7iz85j
The 26 can’t do it
You can maybe get the 100 aoa readout but you’ll never recover
If you don’t get beyond 90 it’s not a cobra
Generally altitude should stay roughly the same, a “perfect” cobra gains no altitude but that’s not really feasible even irl
Basically the radar only scans a 10 degree cone
Elevation controls the angle down (or up) of that cone
It’s a 15 degree cone
Wait I said 10
I’m dumb
Yeah no it’s 15
“Elevation” controls where the midpoint is, it’s relative to the horizon
Yeah it’s actually set to 7.5 exactly
Wasn’t me, was baconism
Maneuverability and speed aren’t the only factors that allow you to cobra, nose authority is the big one for a cobra, and canards allow for insane nose authority
Yeah the F45 detect is the DAS system it gets not unit icons
AoA is dependent on airflow, not the location of your velocity vector/glide slope
You could have the E bracket aligned correctly at 15k ft while climbing
And also AoA for a given airspeed will be higher if you are heavier
No it’s just an AoA reference
It shows the exact same information as the indicator next to the hud
Your velocity vector should be placed onto the crotch of the ship and stay there, you should be “chasing” the AoA
Aoa/glide slope is controlled by your throttle
No but you *can* LOAL a GBU-12
Guess the 114 has fancy software shit it needs it pre-launch for
Tho iirc irl it has LOAL
a bool yeah
there's a "LOAL" bool
pickle is typically used
Missiles are tiny and extremely hard to see, you can't really visually see them until its too late
Imo that should be the no-arm pip mode
If you don’t have a weapon selected it should default to that
Predicted impact point
Which, your flight path market *is*
My “I’m going in blind” load out is typically >6 airs-t’s >8 aim120s >2 AGM-88s >8 GBU-39s >3 GBU-38s (or sometimes a bag)
For all aircraft, weapons increase the radar cross section, for the F45 if you put weapons in internal bays it dosnt
The F45 is so stealthy to begin with that adding weapons extremely significantly increases its RCS
#off-topic
All aircraft in vtol bleed speed extremely quickly in a dogfight
Maybe if you enjoy hovering but some people actually like to dogfight :risitas:
The game dev
BahamotoD
Nah the poll shows there are some av42c lovers
But it’s a slim percent
So either the AIM-9 head tracked
Or hesdslaved boresight mode on the radar
There’s a “boresight” and “mode” buttons on the radar
For the AIM-9 there’s an option in the equip page
Killing friendlies
I started using uncaged mode for the FA26b to do radar slaved
Then someone notched my AIM-9 so I stoped doing that
No i know what I said
Specially they used chaff against my AIM-9, not a notch
Nah it dosnt lol
Specifically, in uncaged mode the seeker of the missile slaved to what you have locked
Which has some advantages over head tracked
However it means if your target uses chaff to confuse the radar
It also confuses the aim9
You can pull the power lever back to reduce your thermal output
No
Collective dosnt really change engine power output directly
Reducing collective *will* reduce power output but not that much and not that quickly
Yes I am (mostly) trolling
The IR sig of the heli is very small, two flares almost always works
What I’m saying *technically* works but it takes time for the engines to spool down and then your rotor stops spinning so you have other issues
200 is very high
190 is about the fastest you ever want to be going, 170-180 tends to be a lot better
Getting waved off is really common even for the people who can consistantly land
LSO expects perfection
If you can post a video of your landing we can likely point out whats going wrong
The perfect middle is between 2 and 3, so you'll catch 3 if you land perfectly centered
Yeah
which you'll go for the two wire there
Thats because landing systems are getting more precise and accuracte, so fewer wires still works out safely
cato trim is only takeoff
it disables shortly after launch
I think the big think you'll want to work on is speed control, you got down to 140 knots with an 11 aoa which is really slow, keep it a bit higher and try to stay close to 8
And of course line up, you'll want to main more to the right of the carrier on approach so you are lined up. You want to aim for the "crotch" all the way in until like 30 ft before touchdown
nah
More or less thats just how it works, there's a lot of factors that go into if you can detect someone, but generally beyond 32 only large aircraft or aircraft with lots of weapons will be detected
9e is older and less capable
its rear aspect only
9E is a rear aspect missile
you need to be behind and able to see the targets engines
You have to hold the trigger, then press teh weapon switch buttons
For the AIM-92s, yes, for everything else you still need a tone
As a tip, you can enable all heat seekers to work this way by setting "trig uncage" enabled, its useful as while holding the trigger the seeker keeps on the target so you can get into a better shot
Nah its front only
I do wish it had vertical scan, it seems like something it should have
In the EQUIP MFD screen
no
It dosn't
Its like that by default
Yes its got both flares and chaff
To deploy them? Or like where they are physically on the aircraft?
On your throttle hand press the use button
Are you in the F-45?
on the TSD, press the HUD button and make sure everything is enabled
np lol
AI do warn you if someone is behind you
Dunno if they do anything about it
Ye theres some voice lines for it
Datalink/radar are uneffected, all that setting changes is the little red/blue `( )` marks you get around an aircraft when they are close
Nah
those marks will be totally gone
they are "game" elements, that is, there's no aircraft system creating them
Correct
Now there's still *tons* of ways to IFF, but it does make it a bit harder to spot units
Yee that too
<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2143368865> skill issue
Don't \|\|spoiler\|\| things, do \<this\>
Nah but <> does
Depends on situation, stall warning only means you have a high AoA, which isn't a bad thing on its own
however if your in a rate fight then yeah your optiomal turn speed is around 300 knots
CR is the amount that the bomb can guide off a purely dumb fall path
So the bomb, under its own control can hit anywhere in that circle
CR is the radius of the circle
F45A?
Also wahts the question/issue
100
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLWW-bbyfJEuQnnMmhSoCq39m3Ge5fxL11G_qbVDd88/edit#gid=259536169
yes
both are extremly effective in vtol
dosn't exist
Nah
AIM-120 don't got no room for an IFF antenna
There's the logic for that more complicated method, that *might* be 120D only
Baha mentioned giving the 120D a slightly better ability to find the correct target by choosing the target closest to the last known
The 120 likely locks the first thing it finds
Actually maybe both do?
Their locking mode is "Closest Any" which I *think* means closest to last predicted
The other possible modes are the game-y ones, "Closest Hostile" and "Original Target"
Also I think it discards any targets more than 1km away from its estimated target pos?
Different chair is going to be the solution, I have a chair with individually raising arm rests which has been amazing for the 94
Also the 120D might actually be unable to accidently FF (unless its fired maddog)
For the throttles of some of the aircraft, I reach them by moving it so my armrest is to the right, and I can reach over it and grab
maybe you can do the same?
So it dosn't spiral out, but, it gets all the targets in its cone then it selects the one closest to the estimated target position. The AIM-120D does smart two way DL (and possibly a bit of game magic) to make sure its locking onto the correct target
the 94 dosn't, collective is fixed
yes
In a rate fight there is some skill in when you choose to tighten your turn, so its a *general* around 300kn, with tightening in some cases
Its a warning that your getting above the recommended flight envelope
Your engines produce less thrust and wings generate less lift
However nothing *bad* per say will happen, I routinely go above
you can configure the altitude warning levels in the OPTION page
As fun trivia, the game used to have a hard cap at 40k
ye
record is like 80somthin k
you could *try*
F45 has a worse TWR than the 26
42 has the best TWR however I suspect its high drag counters it
I believe so
Lemme check
Yea all engines refrence the same atmo and velocity curve
they still wait to be close to target
For the 26, once the radar lock is dropped the DL connection is also dropped
the missile is on its own
10 seconds iirc
maybe 30
^
Likely just for simplicity of interface
Ie, how would you designate the target to be launched upon
Well then how would you designate target #2
What if I don't want to fire at #2, but id rather fire at #3
I want to fire on #1 and #3, but no #2
There's no way to undesignated a single track
To be fair, I think the fix is to have an extra row of buttons on the right hand side that lets you designate without stt
Eh the MFD radar has plenty of buttons free
I think it should be designate buttons 1-4
One row is STT, one row is designate
alternatively, button to change the mode, either "designate" mode or "stt" mode
Tho now that I think about it, long press kinda sounds good. Short press to designate, long press to STT
So, few answers
1) You could turn off your radar and the missile will still continue on, it just won't get any position updates if the target manuvers 2) You can guide missiles in TWS, so you can *guide* missiles on 4 different targets 2.A) Targets that are TWS'ed will continue to update even if you are STT'ed on someone
Nah, because you can keep the previous target TWSed
Aka, have the number on them and a circle on the HUD
This advice is for the FA26b ^
F-45 is different and even better
The F45 dosn't need to lock targets at all to fire
you just select on the TSD
all track files continue updating
Its an AIM-120D, its capable of fire-on-datalink/track file
Even if its not RDR, *anything* that produces a track file it can fire on
Ultimately the missile just needs to know the targets position and velocity, dosn't matter what the data source is
Some methods might have a *slower* update rate, so you'd have less accuracy but its minor
(RWR for instance only updates when you get a ping)
Three presses to lock a target seems a bit much
are people turning their radar off, or are they just locking and unlocking you?
can you link the clip?
ah right thats senanigans, he's not in a dogfight he's in BVR
So there's a bunch of reasons to keep your radar *off* in BVR, radar on exposes your location
due to the inverse square law, an RWR will be able to detect a radar far before the radar can detect the aircraft with an RWR
^ To fire at a cruise missile you need a lock
Right, but it still exposes your location
Plus, the F-45 can fire at a radar
The F-45 also has the ability to detect/fire on people using its EOTS, or using DL, so often keeping it off is useful, however not *always* as there may be targets you miss https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/343253364081033226/989037008355729408/guerilla_radar.mp4
Its important to understand the F45 so you can fight against it
Real life
The TSD extrapolates based off last known position and velocity
So if it hasn't been updated by real data for a while, that extrapolation can be very wrong
Which is what a "false track" is
Basically, using last known location, it predicts the next location
it does that over and over again
But its just a guess, it could be wrong
very bad
they do have RWRs
they didn't a while ago
The logic behind when AI will and won't target you is :shrug:
^
AI enjoy the "out of sight, out of mind" mentality
Moment you are behind them they go for someone else :risitas:
they should always react when they get the MWS/pitbull
Nah
Weapon RCS is applied uniformly everywhere
IRL I bet its actually pretty large
Weapons are typically pretty heavy on RCS (hence, internal bays), and especially with the possible corner reflections with teh aircraft
And of course, if the radar dosn't have LOS to teh missile, it won't effect RCS IRL
I think it could
Underneath the wing where its mostly always covered, not going to really ever be in LOS of the radar if the target is above you
On the wing tip, maybe it tends to be more visible?
But also yeah you get possible corner reflections off the missile <-> airframe interaction
the small dot is telling you the direction the missile will go off at, generally yeah to give your missile the best energy you want to point at it
Rotate engine
90
Weapon operation is mostly the same for all jets, but not all jets have all weapons
Yes, set the bomb to "AUTO"
With "AUTO" it automatically switches to the next GPS point whenever you release
np
Nah to send a GPS target you need to press teh button on the MFD
But you still have to press the button
Yea
Anything you configure *in* the aircraft is specific to that aircraft+pilot
well, only one person can control TADS, the pilot can dumbfire rockets *without* TADS SOI, but, only one person can have the arm
np
nan
Are you using VCAP?
Yea I thought it was 45
There's a smoothlook option
Yes you have to press the mode button a few times
If you run out of fuel just glide to a tanker
Nah cuz I’m on mobile
But I’d like to
Those aren’t modeled, there is a power system modeled however power is only required for startup
uh
Seeing ground units
and its useful for seeing ground targets
Not if the host has unit icons off, also you can use it to peak mountains, or slave TADS, or ID units
right to left 1-4
Radar has a lot of good uses for the 45, the big one I use it for is close range selection/updateing of track files. When you are close range, you need to know ASAP once a track is live/updated/los to you
STT is less likely to drop the contact, but its fairly small benefit due to the track system
This is a good example of why to use the 45's radar from Shenanigans
Going over the hill he knows he needs to get the missiles off ASAP, and has to update the tracks to do so, so enables radar on point which lets him do that extremely quickly
Yeah, its basically a position and velocity known about a target thats shown on the TSD
Generally, VTOL track files are either good, or stale
There's some tiny nuance about update rates, but, generally its either being updated or its not updated
Here's another example of using the 45's radar
Its sorta hard to see what happens, but when I first select the right target, teh radar locks so I know that track is true, valid, and in line of sight so I fire
I select the left target, and the radar dosn't lock onto them, so I know the track is bad and/or they are not in my line of sight, I do fire anyways because I figure I *will* be able to update it, and you can see once they get in my line of sight the radar locks onto them and updates the track
Yeah
The best use of it is to check if a track is valid and check if a target is LOS
Its got more nuanced usages with false tracks and sector scans but that gets a little more complex
EOTS can only slave it target is in LOS and the track file is not stale
np!
single
Would be nice if we could do programs but, because we cant, single is best
Dump in small bursts generally is good, but highest is just wayyyyy too much
Every additional CMS gets exponentially less useful *very* quickly
3-4 per burst, any more than that is a complete waste
Chaff is even less tbh, 1 or 2, but more frequent bursts, you need to keep the chaff in the lock cone
Generally just slowly release in a string
Well, "slowly", still pretty quick
nan
Yeah, chaff is only effective when in the radar locking cone which is super narrow, and chaff dosn't move (well it drops down iirc), and chaff disperses over time (very quickly), so a bit of chaff is ineffective in like half a second
But, a single chaff on its own is extremely effective if its in the cone and the aircraft is in a good beam
So the goal is to try to maintain a chaff or two in the cone as much as possible without wasting chaff, so a steady decently high but not crazy dispense rate is best
Generally anywhere behind and a bit above works
the 45 dosn't tws
afaik
Yeah but the radar itself itsn't doing any sort of tws, so it dosn't get the tws buff afaik
the 45 gets the STT one if its in POINT
Yeah STT is 8x, TWS is 2x
It used to be 4x
The normal mode you'll use 98% of the time is using the aircrafts radar, if you maddog it uses only its own radar. You have to enable it in equip, hold down the trigger, you'll hear a noise indicating your launching as maddog, then the missile will go
And it dosn't guide
Don't use maddog
just
dont
It will only show radar guided missiles that are locked onto you (or scanning your area)
Not quite
rounding errors/floats mean its not 50%
Ignore me
Listen to the others
Not even roleplay I enjoy learning from someone directly more than from a manual
Yes
all the time
the game is so complex lmao there's so much to learn
It does
the `M` value on the MFD will show it in mach
Point at target, hold trigger to uncage seeker, press wpn switch to fire (while holding trigger)
Have to point at target and have to be decently close
AIM-92
the 92 is all aspect
TSD
:risitas:
notching is fairly nice
Chaff is the one that is strict
Requires them to defend so
if they notch, they aren't shooting at you
so you can climb and get closer
Ehhh AIRS-T is point and click
notching at least requries doing something
and a bit of knowledge
the big issue with intercepting was it let you dodge without defending
Jinking is a guns evasion manuver, throwing their gunsight off your aircraft/changing your plane of motion to deny a guns shot
This is a jink
Change plane of motion (the roll) and pull
(and proof that you *can* dodge a bullet)
Thats a good strat, but you need to turn *way more* and you need to hold a turn
Also I don't have audio so I can't tell
but did you G-pull an IR missile :Think:
No ASF-MRM
He would have died if it was a 120
asf30
or 33
well
In some situations it can work on IR missiles
Just requires the launcher to be in a specific mode that litterly nearly no one uses
cutting throttle can be risky kek
I typically fully cut
270
Purely being hotter isnt a guarentee, the missile fov/how close it is to the aircraft and flare cool-down all play a factor
The cooler your aircraft is, the better your chance
too regularly will also be an issue
as it can "lead" the missile to you
Typically, you just die
If someone's behind you, skill being equal, you are fucked
You can cause an overshoot but its difficult and requires them to fuck up
nan
any smart pilot will maintain an altitude advantage over you, they won't follow you through cities
An example of what to do when someone is behind you, only works if the other guy is going too fast
all tactics when someone is behind you rely on the other person fucking up in some major way
Just the number of topgun names that go 0-10 in lobbies gets ironic
the 42c's thrusters are combustion
Manual is best for manuverability but drain a lot of fuel
I mean the 45's are as well depending on who you believe
Then why do they draw fuel when the engine is off :Think:
Well it *should* be bleed air it just shouldn't work with the engine off and probably shouldn't draw fuel
Another thing that adds to its dogfighting ability
I got a kill while traversing vertically backwards
Which was fun because I could see all the 30mm casings ejecting *upwards*
its not *too* effecitve but when your going 15knots in a dogfight
that's 10 times faster than I was going
but yeah itll be useful
I want to like the 94
But
the 230 is just too good
The 94 gimbles quicker and quicker fire rate probably gives it good utility in very close range situations
?
The but is the 230 has way better splash and way better TTK when your not point blank and uses less ammo-per target
kills manpads/infentry way better due to splash
kills tanks way better due to damage
Ironcially it seems the 94 *technically* has more DPS ``` M230  - 260 94    - 300 Vulc  - 1000 GAU22 - 825 GAU8  - 1950 ```
Yes
also the 230 might do splash damage to the thing it hits
so I think its 2x damage
Fun fact, the GAU-8 rounds cannot ricochet
all other in the game can
nan
don't be 8nm away
nan
they can but its less accurate
The missile is optical, it searches in a cone
It always will do that search
the can cone isn't a massive, so it could miss the target
the computer tries to take it into account
but in general, except for the AIM-120s, its very poor at guessing
even for the 120s you as a pilot have to make the decision and know the missile
The DLZ is very useful as a tool of information, looking at it is good
yes
Generally it underestimates
Dynamic launch zone, its the bar on the right that shows when you are in range
its when betty says shoot
Generally I close until I get them on radar, fire, then turn around/notch
You'd want to start high to max pK shot, but if your getting missiles on you before you can fire, want to stay low to defend
np
While the elevators don't, the f45 has no air break it only uses its vert stabs to break
Yes
Well
assuming you don't have peddles yes
seems correct
Im extremely consistant
My code is spelt perfectly
Bcs my IDE has a spellcheck
caged means the seeker will automatically slave to the TGP point
uncaged means you have to hold the trigger
uncaged tends to have a bit higher FOV, and is nicer as the missile isn't randomly caging, and can be *faster* as you cage it early then turn onto target
In PVE, no
There’s never a reason to turn it off in a dogfight
Just use the head slaved boresight
Even PvP
Your in a dogfight, your DLed
Radar comes on
Even in the 45
its an auto-acquisition mode, primarily meant for dogfights close range (but dosn't have to be)
Point circle at target to lock basically
I don't think there's any VTOL specific sources for general strategy, but the strategy from other games is *generally* applicable here as well
VTOL BFM is a bit weird at times, but the concepts remain the same generally
and DCS BVR occurs at different range/speed/mar than VTOL but same idea applies, the concepts are the same just values have to be shifted
np
It can help, but not needed at all, the internet has tons of tools and information to fill in any knowledge gaps
yes
thats basically the whole reason for it to exist
its multicrew
co**pilot** gunner
Still *a* pilot tho
Especially compared to like, a WSO
gunner != wso
the CPG is a fully qualified pilot
Where as a WSO in like an F-15 is not
:thonkery:
Any pilot will tell you a WSO is invaluable
Pilot just drives the bus, WSO actually drops the bomb
Nooooo
WSO does a *lot*
nav, coms, tpod, radar, general SA, weapon employment, basically all AG targeting etc etc
they have 4 screens and 3 joysticks for a reason
Don't do that
don't
why do you want to use maddog?
You are dying to F-45s, not from MADDOGs
yes stealth works
Stealth isn't invisibility, it works well from a nose-on aspcet, side on/bottom/top not as well
Maddog = flies in a straight line off the rail and enables its own radar immidiantly
you'd see it as a red `M` *without* a circle from far off
red M *without* a circle from *far off*
you are dying from red M *with* a circle close in
So those are F-45 missiles, not maddog
the F-45 uses the TSD to fire missiles, no need for radar
Which is how they are doing it
that's a fairly complex topic, there's no singular thing you can do to survive
Generally keep good SA, watch for smoke trails, try to find the 45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQI8fbYpl7o
Obviously they communicate, so likely just a squadron thing for whatever they use
low and close to the target is 100000000% something you communicate
You can always hear people calling when they begin a run and when they exit
but don't
It can, if you were on stable branch of the game notching is a bit buggy there, its been fixed on PTB
np
Right, so there's a lot of small things so ill try to break them down one by one in order - The video starts and you are way too low, the glide slope indicator shows you way low and visually you can tell - Your approach is all over, if you ever see a bank of more than 20 degrees on approach something has gone wrong, and you are passing a 80 degree bank - You do a very drastic pitch up to correct for how low you are, you should *never* be climbing during a landing (0:06) - You get closer to glideslope, but are still low when you bring the nose down (0:13) - Your aimpoint is way off, you want to be aiming for the "crotch" of the carrier, its the corner on the end of runway on the right where the front section of teh boat meets, your aimpoint is on the ramp at the back left corner, opposite of what you want  - At 0:19 your velocity vector is where it should have been for the past minute, but by now you are wayyyyyy too low, and your alignment is incorrect - You aren't aligned with the runway, the runway is angled on the carrier to the left, your nose is pointed straight forward relative to the carrier, which means in practice your nose is pointed far right ofthe runway (0:20) - You touch down well before the wires, you want to land *on* the wires, not before them. This is why your hook didn't grab anything, it hit the deck and grabbed nothing, then you rolled over the wires - And then obviously, when the LSO says bolter, go, it means you didn't catch a wire, your going to go off the end of the boat
Here's a timestamp of me doing a carrier landing for reference, to be clear I should have given myself *much* more room/space/time to line up but I was in a rush, give yourself more distance than I did https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n9nao990Kk&t=1672s
Yeah lol thats a common mistake
The "best" wire to grab is teh #3 if you can get it
#1 is the worst because its so far back so the risk of a ramp strike is high
Are both engines on?
Did you then move to flight?
rotors wouldn't even move with brake
Go faster, but also the “stall warning” just means high AoA, it’s not a bad thing per-say. Also pull smoother/slower at the beginning
Don’t load a ton of Gs on, you’ll kill your speed
No it exclusively means high AoA
You get the stall warning at 18 degrees AoA
IRL stall warnings don’t warn for high aoa
If there is an aoa warning it’s different
F35D is the one with canards
You can just fine tbh
Flaps 1 is just 50% flaps 2, make the decision based off weight/runway/what you feel is correct
yes
the drag isn't *that* much
But come out of the flaps quickly
Depends on your weight, generally two
CATO TRIM is meant to be used *with* flaps :mildpanic:
takeoff you use flaps
cato dosn't auto the flaps
No because the relative speed between them and the missile is lower
high relative speed = missile gets there quicker, so you want them coming at you
Nice
Basically, when the enemy is coming at you, the missile gets there quicker
when they are running away it has to go farther
no
You can guide the missile using TWS
You only need a lock to fire
Also even if you break the lock the missile will continue to the last known location
TWS is when there's a number/circle around it
thats not true
The EOTS and DAS are both capable of providing high quality tracking data without any radar
wdym? For the RWR detection/tracking?
The EOTS knows what direction its pointed (theta/phi) and it knows the distance to the target
That lets you do some trig to calculate the position
Which lets you update a track file
the EOTS would still be on them
The EOTS continuously does that trig/math to keep the track file accurate
its basically the same as a radar
it gets an angle, and a distance
thats all radar gives as well
(well ok yeah radar is bit more complex with some extra data but for the point being)
Yep
Unless they are paying attention for smoke trails
np
yes, switch "MANUAL" to "AUTO" in the weapon config
Nah it saves
you'll have to set it only once, but you have to set it for each *type* of bomb
Yep
Nahh uncaged life
^
The TSD page will show all relevant ARAD data
Its not got HARMs
but it can let you target emitters
which effectively makes any of its weapons a harm
4x38 = 1128 kg 1x161 = 960kg  the bombs are ~15% heavier
bombs can destroy bunkers
it can
I legitametly never use stealth
*never choose my loadout to be stealthy, obviously I use stealth tactics to stay alive
No not really
TAS is true air speed
Aka how fast the air is moving by you
No
Iv flown a cessna but I don't have a license
IAS is indicated air speed, *basically* a measure of the *effective* airflow
At higher altitude, due to lower density, effective airflow is lower
its not *super* realistic compared to IRL, but the game does try to emulate/match as much as reasonable without making the game unfun
for the helicopter
The jets dont have it
AH-94 superiority
Yes
Btw @Browning we talked about how the missiles followed a curved line
nan
here's a photo that shows that
also the F-45 didn't notice his wingman getting shot down lmao
when its ready
When it can run without me babying it the whole time
yeah
The line coming off the front of the aircraft?
Where the person is looking
Yeah
yep
I have no idea how to do that, webgl is annoying with lines
Thats something different, your in a helicopter moving very sideways, so when you fire the GBU goes off to the side
You need to fire when you are "coordinated" - no yaw slip
nan
Hard to tell in this photo, but the ball is all the way to the left, you need to center it
If its centered when you fire, the missile will go off straight
Also being a glide bomb, its *really* not maneuverable until the wings are deployed and its got some airspeed
so its abnormally effected by non-coridnated launches
Either effects equally
Weapons apply RCS in all directions uniformly
The fins on the back do have control, but I believe its low, and originally the bomb was built to be deployed from a jet going 600 knots, at low speed its got very poor performance, so you need to give it a moment to accelerate
As for the GPS target sort of teleporting up its a known issue with the bomb prediction when you are low/below your GPS point
well the first tip is to be lower
higher alt = missile has more performance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQI8fbYpl7o
All im gunna say is if the LSO said waveoff it probably wasn't perfect
nan
2 wire is not perfect
The 3 wire is the target
you want to land dead middle in the wires, so between the 2 and 3
and obviously that means you'll grab the #3
And just because you grabbed a wire dosn't mean it was a good landing, iv gotten plenty of terrible landings that still ended in a #3
Here's an example of a poor landing that still gave me #3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n9nao990Kk&t=1672s
I didn't call LSO but im sure that he would have waved me off for being too high and too high AoA
ofc not
Nose 5 degrees up, AoA of 8
So nose 5 up, velocity vector 3 down
Or phrased propperly, a 3 degree glideslope with an 8 degree AoA
Yeah roughly
The booster decouples, I’ll check exact values in an hour once I’m on my PC
60ish nm
SSEvasive only effects the terminal phase, so no
Unlike a regular missile, a cruise missile continues to produce thrust the entire time so it dosnt hurt it much for it to maneuver
Only works in single player, its basically a single player cheat for messing around
I’m the 45 you can’t just turn off the G limiter you turn off all flight assists
Yes
You queue weapons via the TSD page, not the radar page
you don't need a radar lock to fire an AIM-120 in the 45
Don't use maddogs
:risitas:
Its always the same
Wait
I fucking told you not to
:risitas:
nan
"you notch with chaff"
:risagony:
*beaming*
Notching is beaming with terrain behind you
you have a ball on your HUD you can use for glideslope
Should be, if you have gear/hook down on final
Bottom left of the HUD
this is the 26b hud but it shows where it is
CASE-1 landings are not super useful for someone trying to learn
Pattern work looks cool but not useful
Important thing is altitude/distance on the final approach
Iirc at night VTOL has lights, but during the daytime you can use your TGP to zoom in to see it better
I learned to land on a carrier before on a regular runway, they are very different skills
bruh lmao
hook and gear down?
Well as general advice I wouldn't recommend flaps 2 in the kestrel, your aiming for an 8aoa but the flaps in that thing are so large your going to have too much lift
thats also too fast for an 8AoA
There's no perfect altitude and speed, 800ish ft and 180-170 knots is good, you want to have an 8 AoA while keeping in glideslope
Id recommend learning on the 26b as it seems the AV42c dosn't have a ball, and you can always vertical land in the 42
There's a number on the left of the HUD that shows AoA, *technically* you are aiming for a 3 degree glide slope, so the w is at the 5degree mark and the velocity vector is at -3 degrees
but generally just try to keep the AoA at 8 and you'll be good
knot feet and nautical miles
:Think: no
yeah your aiming for the "crotch"
this point
Throttle
Pitch for airspeed, throttle for altitude in general
in this case its more keep pitch for AoA, increase throttle if you need altitude
Yeah
Which is why once you’ve been locked you have to go farther than when it initially turned on away from it
Gimme a minute making coffee then I’ll check
As far as I can tell the LR always weighs a bit more
However all the maneuverability stats otherwise are the same
Interestingly theres a listed value for "Booster Mass", but the BSM-66LR's mass is not just 66 + Booster mass
It appears the code for reducing mass when the booster jettisons exists, its not used for the BSM-66LR
just gotta click this check box
Well, CTRL+C, CTRL+V, click box
That should be done automatically I think
There's no code just unity changes
Baha send me the unity project ill do it :isforme:
actually would have to update this list
And possibly some net-entity related updates
nah its more spicy when even the mission designer dosn't know what type they've selected
yis
its a missile with 100 guns that go off when it gets near you
nan
Maddog means you fire an AIM-120 without guidence, it flies off in a straight line with its internal radar searching for a target, its purpose is to team kill due to the fact that it has no IFF
Video here
Not pog don't use it
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/343253364081033226/992625114837430372/unknown.png
nan
It means the missile has switched to its internal radar and is tracking the target
I wouldn't say "acting as a fox 1" but yes, until that point you are sending guidance commands to the missile
Why would you turn off your radar lol
You having your radar off dosnt make them turn *their* radar off kek
You’re in a 26b, everyone can see you anyways
That only happens in the 45
In the 45 you don’t need your radar on at all
We are talking about the 26
Have you flown the F/A-26b?
what???
I have like 970 :Think:
They did :Agony:
IRL RWR/fighting does not work like it does in the video games
Yeah 26v26 radar on only marks on RWR
there is some merit in not showing on RWR, it gives the enemy SA and that can be useful, but generally yeah you'll be seen from so far away
Hey man you know your in the VTOL VR server right?
Anyways here's a video of F-15E's with radar on while doing bombing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hppQM5PGHYE
IRL the only aircraft that would have their radar off ever would be like an F-35 or F-22, something stealthy, but even then LPI/AESA radars mean that dosn't matter
Enemy radar has no bearing on if you have *your* radar on
Also the video is legitimately them taking out a SAM site that just fired at them, so it wasn't just all taken out with stealth lol
Sneaking in radar on or off dosn't matter due to AESA
its got two different RWRs, one on each wing tip
IRL RWR's don't have nearly enough accuracy to really do that but eh
For a ground target you can pretty easily do it by getting multiple pings over time
No
thats not how RWRs work IRL
They found the SAM by its smoke trail from the missile launch using their TGP
Well first they used the ground radar, they used that ground radar map to slew the TGP, then used the TGP to find the SAM
HARMs are fairly complex, there's a few ways you can fire it
However what I mentioned with ground targets being easier to track, the HTS can try to locate a stationary emitter and fire on it
Generally, a HARM is told the aprox location of a emitter based off the HTS, and its programmed to look for the specific signal you launched against
there's also sort of LOAL modes that let you say "hey go look for an SA-10" and you blind fire it in a direction and it homes in on any SA-10 emissions it can fine
I think non-native speaking is the issue
You can do that in the 45
You can in the 45
It dosn't make sense for the 26 to have it
Or heaters
Isn't the fighter mafia actually *against* sensor fusion/long range BVR
Thats... not how modern combat works
The days of "low and fast" are sadly the days of the past
Now we have AIM-120s with terrain avoidance and AESA radar capable of picking out an aircraft even when its behind terrain
AWACS isn't god, you don't want to guide an AIM-120 on a datalink track that updates once every 10 seconds
:Think: no
*Maybe* if I get baha
Actually I think I still want Ox
Using their own radar lmao
"Notching" means to put the missile at your 3 or 9, while having terrain behind you
so generally you want to be very low (below the missile) flying perpendicular to it
Its a red M on your RWR
Yeah
for IR missiles you want to flare
IR missiles are fired from such a close range you can see them anyways
By "getting close" do you mean getting within the 25nm TGP range? Also what aircraft?
> i try to lock onto something Lock on using what? The TGP?
>  > i try to lock onto something
What are you doing?
:Facepalm:
I can't help you if you don't answer my questions
You want to use the GPS-S button on the TGP
You can hit it with an AIM-120
^
Means you have to enable POINT mode
Np
Just make sure to point lock in the F-45, its required for some reason
Nah, it requires a POINT
Any track that isn't created with an STT is counted as a "DL only track" and behaves a bit different, im guessing its something with that
https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN32045-ATP_1-02.1-001-WEB-3.pdf
Angels are used to refer to a friendlies aircraft in thousands of feet
We use it for enemy as well for simplicity
Also because the game reads out altitudes in thousands so
Anyways @Freedomplaza is the document creator
Freedom you'll have to repost what I sent
Its basically always in a TWS mode
You don't manually select a target to be TWSed, the TSD handles managing tracks for you
Everything in the F-45 is always a "soft lock"
basically
You never need STT to fire
The TSD just manages the track file system
Everyone understands what angles are, brevity is about everyone understanding each other so imo it’s fine/better to keep it that way rather than confuse people with the difference
There’s a *lot* of brevity that vtol players get incorrect
Kek
I mean baha said I should make HC do automatic speech to text so I could automate the enforcement of proper brevity…
I’m not going to do speech to text that seems like a lot of work lmao, but I will do some sort of awacs mode that lets you talk to/hear players
That *can* work, the issue is chaff dosn't seem to change the missiles predicted velocity, which means once it unlocks the chaff it will try to re-lock you
Any direction works, its best to remain in a beam if possible so generally up/down
Yeah preferably chaff would trick the missiles predicted velocity as well
Nooo I mean chaff should confuse the missile so it dosn't know how fast you are going
but right now it dosn't do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQI8fbYpl7o
This channel pins have lots of useful materials
My personal tactic for preventing the shot on the merge is to push a bit of negative G with a bit of Yaw
I tried barrel rolls but kept ending up off of where I wanted to be for the merge
Yeah, out of plane pulls work really well, if you want to kill someone else iv found just being erratic amounts of pitch works really well
Plus generally just being rough on the controls
Smooth motions are good for energy but make you predictable
And of course if someone is far enough back just keep your eyes on them and dodge the bullets
That works until you have someone smart enough to just stay 500 ft above you
Do all the low level mountain shit you want, I’ll sit 500ft above you until iv closed the distance
Only if you change the input
Yes, all that matters is you keep the STT on the target
what weapon you have selected dosn't matter
"Single target track", means you have them locked with the green box around them
No, if the lock is lost the missile is trashed (for AIM-7s)
For AIM-120s ^
It sends the entire group you have selected
It dosn't include path mode on/off, but it does preserve order
np
yes
high is also generally bad
Radars do better the more "up" they look
its world up not local up lmao
Radar itself
All radars in VTOL get a small buff when pointed up
head on is that dimple into it
The aircraft are all facing *roughly* how they are in the photos below
nan
yeah
Smol has a much better photo lol
its still worse than nose on
Until you get more than 15 degrees, knife edging increases RCS
If you can manage it, 43 degrees is best
Well nose on is 0 degrees
you want to yaw 43 degrees away from the radar source if you remain flat
RCS is *basically* how much radar energy is reflected back to the receiver
Bigger = more energy is relfected/returned
Yes
Detection is harder than maintaining a lock
by a factor of 8x
Be low, be nose on, understand you aren't a stealth fighter
have no weapons/hardpoints
Im a terrible teacher
The pinned material is very useful tho
Yes
ye its all aspect
the aircraft itself is the only thing with directional RCS (technically missiles have directional RCS, but thats not enabled until its fired)
Yeah
these are the current radar related consts
And now your missile has missed because you didn't give it guidence
Yeah the objective isn't to make a BVR chart for low-level BVR
That *is* legitametly important
I fight very very differently depending on who it is
which is why my performance in a lobby goes up as I learn what each player will do
The jet button is the worst part of the 26, its practically worthless in combat
it should have a knob
Sel, Empty, AG, All
Hoesntly of the option empty is the one that could go
Hardpoints add *very little* total RCS
Its not hard, just very tedious
Already done
Actually nvm I think it was BFM
But baha has a learning AI
Yeah
BDLearningBot twas his name
Just for fun I believe
if it worked well im sure baha would incorporate it
Iirc training was taking too long
If its generalized whats even the point
Also even generalized its *really* complex
Whats your aircraft type? Whats their aircraft type? How many missiles do you have? What are the mission restrictions on missiles? Is it AIM-7s because thats a who new game. What SA do you have on the enemy team? What SA does the enemy team have on you? What terrain is there? Are you over open ocean? Whats your fuel state and weight? Etc etc etc
And most of these aren't yes/no questions
Click and hold for 1 seconds
Why would you want to "kill power" during a high-G manuver? High-G is when you want power
Pulling power is possibly the worst thing you could do in an instance like that, if your objective is to "dodge" a missile, or G-pull it, all that matters is acceleration, a hard reduction of power is obviously going to be an acceleration *however* its practically worthless compared to the Gs you can pull just regularly by going back on the stick
What reducing power like that does is mean the very next missile is guaranteed to kill you
Dodging a missile is worthless if the very next one kills you
Yeah, there's plenty of  options that *don't* put you in a bad position tho
G-pulling without breaking, notching, breaming, chaff, dragging, terrain masking,
Thats just death
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/369927249878843392/991029524407926784/unknown.png
It continues going to the last known position
Also quick note of phrases, "maddog" means to fire the missile without a radar lock, "pitbull" means an AIM-120 has switched to its internal radar
Theres a folder called radio music
Reduced weight for landing, reduced weight for BFM/combat, you can practice AAR for longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQI8fbYpl7o
Flares wont do anything to an AIM-120, chaff will but only if you are beaming
Do that ^
chaff sets off the proximity fuse?
I know AIM-9s use a laser sensor proximity fuse, so it wouldn't be effected/triggered by flares/chaff, I dunno about 120s
Issue is chaff dosn't stick around for very long
At least in vtol it quickly expands/disperses
yeah lol
In VTOL its not simulated, being pure cold the missile wont even consider the missile
Yeah I meant won't even consider the chaff lol
Actually... the radar sim is a lot more complex than you might think
There *isnt* any dice roles/probability, its all deterministic math, chaff can degrade/cause a track to shift off of the target/lag behind the target
I think the reason its not simulated is that it nearly never would have an effect
I don't think it would be super difficult to make chaff have an obscuring effect, thats a pretty straight forward process of find chaff thats within the lock cone, thats closer than the target, but its *pretty* rare that you have a situation where you are "behind* chaff relative to teh radar
For when you are pure cold is the only time I can think
Even then, chaff dispenses downwards and falls down, so you'd have to be descending as well right?
hmm maybe
But why are you running away, go kill the thing 😄
You've got a gun, do what must be done
Stable branch might have some weirdness related to notching, but also remember once you've been locked the radar gets an 8x buff to the radar so notching is now 8x harder
Im not sure, I don't know much about it, I just know baha claims to have fixed something
Notching isn't a speedgate in VTOL, effectively the lower your closure rate the "harder" time the radar has tracking you, which is included in the number with 8x radar buff. Basically, in a perfect notch (0 knot closure) the radar has a 0.0125 multiplier applied
Basically you start with your base RCS, multiple buffs due to TWS/STT, multiple debuff due to notching
Returns a final value that is compared to the radar sensitivity to see
For A2A in general the AIM-120 has the highest range
For close range, the AIRS-T
Knowing the range of target is likely a counter to notching, however, the issue is you must allow signals from behind/infront of the target, iirc there's something called a range-gate thats somewhat related to this IRL that makes it a bit more involved
There's also the consideration of update rate, in a TWS mode the range you have to allow to be considered is way higher due to the scan rate compared to STT
Yeah, an AESA probably can do tricks with knowing aprox range to target and filtering ground behind it, but mechscanned simply can't so they just use regular speedgate
But also knowing aprox range to target only works if you've already got a track on a target
Pure doppler on its own no
Mechscanned are normally "pulse doppler radar"
If they notch before the track is created there's nothing you can do
Against an aircraft radar, maybe, but lets say they fire an AIM-120 at you
If its a 120D maybe its advanced enough to be told the range to filter out but older 120s wont
"Closest blob" isn't an easy thing to get, a massive amount of terrain noise and your looking for a specific mark in it, maybe with enough processing power and time, but not something you can do on a missile
Much of what you said with that range thing. Our VTOL radars use a PD radar with a highly-dynamic filter setting, to the point where the radar can intelligently choose the filter point for different targets. If the radar is STTed on the target, it is so sure of where the target is it can reduce the PD down as far as reasonable
:Think:
Not if they are notching
Well you can be pretty far off perfect, doppler filters tend to be high
Yeah bomb does plenty enough damage
You just have to get it in teh explosion radius lmao
I don't have a clip for that :risitas:
sounds hard
and im lazy
speaking of lazy
anyone want to help me test something
Rotations for HC
I mean
I am learning and asking questions
that seems reasonable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQI8fbYpl7o
ARAD page press "HUD" so it says "ON"
no
it will show you what direction it is
Aspect and bearing are not location
Aspect and bearing over time is yes
well
yes
but thats not the 26
well
it is
but not displayed to the user
A very convoluted representation of it yes
the briefing/comms should explain, your looking for a boat with 8 missile launcher tubes on the front
If you want to see what it looks like:
Yeah use your targeting pod
It should be basically in the center of the fleet
Let me look, I suspect its first seen
Why does an AGM-89 have an MWS on it :Think:
I think its smart enough to evade missiles lmao
Yeah lmao SSEvasive is a legitimately an intelligent evasion system with an MWS to avoid missiles :risitas:
Ok so the locking logic is complex Type 1: Select all targets within 100m of the GPS point, find the closest to the GPS point, target it Type 2: Select all targets within 2500m of the GPS point, find the closest to the GPS point, if that target is within 3000m of missile, target it
It attempts type 1, if that dosn't work it attempts type 2
hold throttle press A button
There is not
You can use single player cheats to disable all flight assists but that makes it very difficult to control
hmm the phrasing of some of the tool tips is a bit vague and the code is confusing so im not actually sure what I said was correct
the type 2 locking has a tool tip that reads "If we found a bunch of targets near the GPS but not close enough for a certain decision, we pick the closest one when we fly this distance away from it"
"Pick the closest one and fly this distance *away* from it"?
Also it seems like type1 and type2 are the same with different ranges, which shouldn't matter as the way I described them it both types give the same answer for a target
Im not sure, there's def something im missing here
Ooooo now this is an interesting find!
Leading your target is *bad*
Maybe
Well still depends but
When the missile spots a target, it works out based off the targets current velocity (which its getting from its radar) and the time at which it was fired, *where the target was when you fired*
So then it finds the target closest to the GPS point *when you fired*
Actually for each target it considers the *current* distance to GPS point, and the estimated distance the target was when you fired (it chooses whichever value is smallest)
Im still not sure the difference between targetCertaintyRadius and decisionDistance tho...
Yes sorta but it seems like theres no need for `certaintyRadius`, im not sure why there are two values
well yeah when you have perfect computer predicted lead
But, especially if you are hitting a group of boats and want to make sure the missiles hit different targets you are better off putting the GPS points directly on target
Yeah
I mean how fast do the boats move?
at 25knots, as long as the missile time of flight isn't greater than 3.4 minutes then you are fine
Only if the time of flight is high
If it’s within 3.4 minutes the missile is nearly guaranteed to find the target
But yes turning boats would throw off trying to hid the specific target you wanted
The GBU-39ERs are the only weapon it has to take out bunkers
You can fire your full 1200 rounds it'll never work
np
If your on-speed you'd have a hard time snapping the wire
I did a max-fuel on-speed landing yesterday and was fine
8aoa/proper glideslope
210 ish knots iirc
yeah more or less
A max-weight landing will come close to the limits
but if you approach correctly you'll be fine
Also there is no reason to do a max-weight landing
1 wire also is the worst wire to get
That changed a while ago, like a year ago iirc
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/806991386893090846
It was changed 1.5 yr ago
There's two different missile warnings
the one created by the MWS and the one created by the RWR
There's a *ton* of ways you can use to avoid a pitbulled missiles, G-pulling works but can be risky
chaff is an option
Not sure what you mean "bleed out"
Chaff is only useful while beaming
You want to deploy it while doing gental turns around the beam
Missile energy is unrelated to the effectiveness of chaff
Beaming is basically waht you are doing when you are notching
putting the missile on your 3/9
You can beam without AB
Notching is beaming with terrain behind you
Yeah
AI have shockingly low crossections, sometimes to the point where im convinced theres some sort of bug to be found here
nan
No
There’s lots of reasons to turn your radar on but they are nuanced
As a general rule of thumb you don’t need it
I’m basically reiterating what the others said, but what’s discouraged: - shooting on the merge in dogfighting lobbies - intercepting incoming missiles with AIRS-Ts - spamming all your missiles at one target - shooting an AIM-120 at a furball (it has a decent chance to friendly fire)  That being said most of that is for PvP, for PVE people care a lot less, the only big thing is to read the mission briefing, and if it has limited lives being carful with it
Ehh gun jink is easy enough, I very rarely get shot on the merge anymore despite people trying
Just push negative Gs a bit and yaw a bit
for ground target, its aim and shoot, plane handles your closure rate/gravity/all that
Many are, not all
Notably MAD-4A, FLKM-100, and ESuperMissile are active guided
The FLKM is super rare, you’ll almost never see it
afterburner basically dumps fuel directly into the engine exhaust
It produces a ton of extra thrust but at the cost of a huge fuel burn rate
You do by pressing the throttle all the way forward, you'll feel a small "bump" as it clicks on
yeah, theres a small line on the HUD that shows where it is
Anytime you need more thrust
For all intents and purposes you don't need to think about it any different than regular thrust
Except that it will burn more fuel, so just keep your eye on that
nan
This is that line I was talking about, above that line is AB
No problem
Yeah MWS/Launch warn if in the sensor
Even bombs :flooshing:
you cannot without single player cheats
technically you can do it without mods
In single player, you can hold `Q` while spawning to disable all flight assists
the 26 has a switch for it
but yes technically holding Q also works
Depends on range, how you use the flares, and if you maneuver
Heaters in general can sometimes just decide your not going to have a good day and murder you lmao
Yeah I agree lol
Theres *technically* no RNG but some days I swear the AIM-9s have been replaced by python-5s
There is
Engine takes a bit to spool down
Spoolrate is `0.6`, how that translates into cooldown rate? No idea
Just checked, this one is correct
0.6 seconds
yes but itll take a sec to get the answer
Ok idfk too much math I think its like a bit over double
I think it multiplies the regular heat by 1.22 and adds it onto the regular heat
but there's all sorts of lerping/spool rates/other shit so im not sure
regular heat being the amount of heat produced for that power setting without AB
which in effect might mean its more than 2.22x because I believe you only have access to 75% of the throttle before it auto-enables AB
Maybe ill setup a quick sim for it
Oh idle is 0.03 and mil is 0.75
93 heat units vs 2343 heat units
Also this is for *engine RPM*, not for *heat itself*. The engine has a heat emitter high cooldown rate but im not sure how it effects the final heat
Yeah when you move the throttle it takes 0.6 seconds for it to each the new position
AB has a seperate spoolrate, the engine spools up much faster with AB enabled
Not on stable, but on PTB it will say in the game log
Oh
Well
if its a red `M` on your RWR its radar
If its fired from far away its radar
Like, a list of which missiles are air to air?
Anything with "AIM" in the name, stands for air-intercept-missile, here's a list: ``` - AIM-9E   - heat - AIM-9    - heat - AIM-9+   - heat - AIRS-T   - heat - AIM-7    - radar - AIM-120  - radar - AIM-120D - radar ```
nan
Typically you want it 30 to 45 degrees off left or right, whichever its closest to when it starts
G-pulling is high-risk high-reward. Get it right and you've kept a really good position, get it wrong you die
There are other safer options when trying to avoid a missile
On your throttle hand, press the "A" button
Nope
Its the A button for me
nan
(iv made up these letters)
the hell that is HTC Vive wands
To fit my narrative
Correct thats why you use the A button
nan
This is why you shouldn't always shoot when the nice lady tells you to
true
yes
Just within the circle
I think I did awhile ago, but it’s 15
Iv been meaning to test this, my guess is tws can use the full 120deg vertical gimble
Its fire and forget, once you've fired its fully on its own, but what you can do is basically have the EOTS pointed at something "behind" a mountain and fire at that
You can use the "EOTS" button the the TSD to do that, the missile uses its own sensor to try to find the target
No, unless you are damaged the aircraft should be automatically trimmed for you
Beaming is putting the missile on your 3/9 line, notching is doing that with terrain behind you so that the missile looses lock
You can, notching makes the missile loose you in the terrain clutter and drop its lock
You need terrain behind you (making it notching), if its open-sky then no
Unless of course you use chaff, chaff works with beaming to confuse the missile
If you want to notch/beam/chaff the missile you have to turn onto the 3/9 line
If its direct 6, depends on the range but typically you can just run away
chaff works at any range
notching depends on your RCS
higher RCS means notching must be done sooner
Chaff and notching can work togeather bcs once the missile has lost lock notching becomes way better
For dragging there's no set range
its all about altituide/speeds/missile energy
To be clear, its *not* related to render distance, the super missile cruiser engages at 25.6nm which just *happens* to be close to the render distance
The missile cruiser uses an estimated unit RCS so try to guess at the range it could fire at
Im guessing this is to prevent it from fireing and *instantly* loosing the lock?
But it assumes a decently small RCS for the target which is why it waits to fire
I believe MAD-4 uses same logic
Interestingly, because the MAD-4 has a slightly better radar this means it shoots at 26.4nm
Other SAMs use a specific max-launch range value
Such as 11.3nm for the BSM-66
Mrk1 eyeball
nan
IR missiles are fired at such a close range you shouldn't be using the EOTS
Thats a good habit
The smoke trails are visible yes, but they are visible without the EOTS as well
You'll be locked on radar and itll be marked as red, and making a special audio effect
The missile itself has a smoke trail and *might* show up on MWS
ARAD *targets* a radar
Radar guided targets a metal object in the air
You can *try* but its exceptionally unlikely to hit
an ARAD missile only gets a target position update when it gets hit by a burst of radar energy
So if the incoming AIM-120 is locked onto you it won't update at all, and if its scanning it will update *very slowly*
no
an ARAD missile only gets a target position update when it gets hit by a burst of radar energy
Which means it only gets an update when it gets scanned
?
The AGM-145 isn't ARAD
the F-45 dosn't have ARAD missiles
AGM-88s have a bit better range, but again, F45 dosn't carry them
Only the F-45 and AH-94 carry the AGM-145
Neither of those aircraft have an ARAD system or HARMs
The aircraft with 145's don't have HARMs
AGM-161 is pretty good for long-range
But yeah the AGM-145 is generally an amazing missile and the #1 option
If you are using *hydras* yes, but you can also use the PGM's which are laser guided hydras
and you can use pylon tilt automatic to help you, it will automatically aim the vertical axis for you
they work exactly like the 145s
Yeah
But you should generally use the AGM-145s unless you need to kill bunkers
Yes, or by poping the radar dome over a mountain
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/949023427128328294/998614168301228162/unknown.png yes
nan
ehh in 95% of cases you can leave it at -7 and call it good
If something is specifically close below you then yeah
if im fighting over a city I tend to lower the angle a bit
There is
you loose range
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/949023427128328294/998614168519323728/unknown.png
Its only got the AIM-92s which suck
Its a helicopter, the forces acting on it change widly depending on your inputs/collective/airspeed etc
You'll never perfectly trim it
The pilot should just setup screens on the ground and leave them, the gunner can handle anything needing interacting with
As a pilot with a gunner, NAV and RADAR
With no gunner, NAV and TADS
Ehh the gunner is nearly always going to be SOI on TADS
I can be IDENTing radar contacts to know where threats are, I can STT something and tell my gunner to press SLAVE to it
With TADS I can't do anything, im just watching
Yeah solo its 100% NAV TADS
Well im assuming competent gunner
For incompetent yeah I have TADS up (or just don't fly with them)
You have to have the TADS screen up to have it head slaved
Which is weird as you can radar boresight without that screen up
Lack of SA, being very slow to bring weapons on target, not knowing propper employment of weapons, not knowing which weapons are best for a situation, spending too much time on one target, being very slow to react to new contacts, not keeping eye on NAV, not keeping eye on RWR, not keeping eyes out of cockpit
Its fundamentally two issues, bad SA, and being slow
As a pilot only time I should ever be notifying my gunner about something is when iv noticed a higher-priorty threat via RADAR
such as a AAA system
lmao
HC can tell where you are looking so bad gunners lookout
*technically can* but its not useful lmao
you can only SOI one thing
I still am mad that the 26 dosn't get a better radar than the 45
IRL the F-15 gets a more modern radar than the F-35
and is physically larger, which players a large part in radar capability. Its the whole reason the F-15 is as big as it is, its gotta lug around a massive radar dish
still
bigger radar should equal better
F-45 actually gets a *better* radar than the 26, which is very counter intuitive
Im not arguing for realistic, im arguing that the 26 having a better radar would be a good thing gameplay wise, and its got a grounding in realism to justify it
the F-15 has a digital system/radar
it uses the APG-82 AESA, the F-35 uses the APG-81 AESA
The radars we have in vtol are basically mech-scanned anyways
sort of, they are like AESA radars that have a slow-scan time idfk its weird
Oh yeah, I thought you were saying the opposite lol
I mean
Ok yeah nvm I forgot how good the awacs was
The MAD-4 and missile cruiser have better radars
26
But yeah baha better radar for the 26 pls 🙏
Why do you want to fly an ILS?
No you should never touch scan angle
scan angle means you are scanning less sky, which espeically when they are close is the opisite of what you want
Yes I am saying 'never' here for simplicity, there are some *very specific* edge cases that lowering scan angle is useful
However *nearly always* its best to have max-scan angle
wdym?
Why would you want that in the 45?
Sure but you can just move the cursors between targets
^
You can also queue your "next" shot by putting the cursors over a target, fire, press down, fire
but for the first one
CCRP is way superior to CCIP in vtol, its extremely accurate, much more accurate than you can get with CCIP
Well im not sure why you are using *either* given we have guided weapons :risitas:
Valid
Cluster bombs accuracy dosn't hugely matter either way lol
for low tech I just carpet bomb lmao
Well, thats not true
I do A2A only and completly ignore the objective like the very good teammate I am
If I happen to get near I just gun the tents
Every time I tried to bring a bomb I ripped it off due to the Gs I pulled lmao
G-limiter off as long as you can handle it without destroying your aircraft
I never have G-limiter on
Yeah
its all about time
You'll break the plane *very quickly* at 16gs
but if you only hit it for a fraction of a second, your fine
its like 7 or 8, but again, its a game of time
Yes its true, you don't need to ping the dev for that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je4dYwtFwWc this dosn't perfectly show it (and is a really old video), but you can tell the way the missile might tend upwards to the hotter-newer flares
as high as you can safely fly
higher = better
nails is ping, spike is lock iirc
Yeah, nails is when the radar is searching/pinging, spike is when it hard locks
yeah
combat collective, hold trigger, press cms button
The F-45 guides missiles using the TSD track files, any datasource can produce a track file
So, radar, RWR, EOTS, DAS, or any of those things via datalink
If you can get the target via another data source, no
But if you have no other data sources on the target, then yes
like 1.07 or somethin around there
exist
don't turn on radar
don't have external weapons
keep your nose pointed at the target
you are at your stealthiest when you are behind a mountain
Yeah only use internal bays
Yep
Both, but you aren't *invisible*
Its just harder to see you
so they will have to get closer
You are stealthier when you are below them
That only matters in PVP
And even then is minor, I still use my AB a lot
It makes you easier to visually see
Both on EOTS, and with mrk1 eyeballs
Oh if you've already been seen it dosn't matter
Well obviously you have to be able to avoid IR missiles
but if you've been seen you typically want as much speed as possible
"up" meaning what?
Your not invisible, they can see you visually
but you can get within 10 miles without being detected
Yeah the gun has a door that covers it up when not shooting
the gun is an internal weapon
np
No, VTOL has extremely little "game cheating", it tries to justify/make everything happen realistically
The AI play by the same rules as us (ok they have a simplified flight model for performance reasons but it shouldn't have a major effect)
Which SAMs do you see them dodging?
Friendly carrier SAMs are trash, so it makes sense they could be dodges super easily
The F-45 one I cant remember what SAMs are there, but if its SRAD then those are also super-bad
The allied units get *fairly* trash SAMs all around, there was a recent change to fix it recently to give them a better on but I believe thats still on PTB
can you post a video of that occurring?
My guess is it was an IR missile fooled by flares
It can be very hard to see the flares
Also iirc theres some bugs with them not showing
Tho I thought that was in MP so im not sure
Nah, when it comes to missiles AI play fair
Their missiles work identical to your missiles
and your missiles work against them exactly like a player
Well I say that despite having countless videos of AI *not* playing fair, but its at least *intended* for AI to play fair lol
nan
But these are all old videos, afaik currently AI work correctly
DCS tactics *roughly* work, but ranges/specifics change for vtol. Its better to say DCS *concepts* work but are used differently in vtol
its a cone
radar
tho imnot sure how the game handles the translation from your head view and the radar for locking things
my guess is your head dictates an angle the radar should go to, so you end up with the circle on your HUD a *bit* miss-aligned
Yeah it dosn't matter
You can see the effects of it more-clearly on IR missiles
I think it always chooses the same pylon if both are armed
there's no way to step through pylons unless you arm/disarm things
If you disarm pylon 1, it switches to pylon 2, but if you rearm pylon 1 it jumps back to that one
depends
5km is one of the ranges
which one?
:shrug:
actually
20km
for launch warnings
maybe
im not
nan
Yeah launch warning is 20km
Or 10.7nm
MWS is complex and based off missile heat
which is based off booster, when the booster burnt out, and how fast its going
so
no idea
The DAS? No baha calls it that
nan
I mean *technically* its the visual target finder
but thats just a code name
the game dosn't explain it to the user at all
but, the game dosn't explain *anything* about the F-45 to the user
that mission is always a shit show, "free flight" maps that allow weapons are always terrible/toxic
It also shows ARAD locks, and TGP locks
TGP, RADAR, TSD, ARAD
Which was funny when I saw an AV-42c locking an F-45 at like 60 miles :risitas:
Then remembered ARAD shows lines as well
Notch, chaff, use terrain to break LoS, or G-pull
High-G turns work *better* when they have lots of energy
Practice
Its all muscle memory
You have hud ARAD on right?
You want to pull them off your side a bit
No I mean you see the RWR diamonds on the HMCS right?
nan
if they don't appear thats an IR missile
Smooth is better
Jaiden's 120s have really good close-range performance for some reason
chaff ftw
you should never used maddog
Anyways the maddog mode dosn't enable the internal seeker until 1 second after launch, so its not useful point-blank close range anyways
45 or 26 logic remains the same
Both have to have it
It makes a really great gift
You've put AAA in the wrong spot
AAA while easy to prevent entering its range, is *extremely lethal* once you are in its range
In the F/A-26b not directly, in the 45 its shown on the TSD
in teh 26 you can TWS them, then look at them, the value shown at the top of the HMCS is the current heading you are looking at
so if you look at a friendly, it will show them
Yeah its the `B` on teh radar page
Use NAV, RWR, and RADAR to IFF targets
on NAV and RADAR enemies are always orange
For RWR, you need to know the different types
F and F+ are enemy AI
26 and 45 are Team A aircraft FA and FS are Team B aircraft
Easy way to remember is Team B gets letters, team A gets numbers
It has a circle around it on the RWR
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Radar_Warning_Receiver_(RWR)
I think I do it some in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhRD8mTsiQ
There's also SR
Turn on the HMD?
Like, the TGP overlay?
You press and hold in the stick for one second while SOI'ed on the TGP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQI8fbYpl7o
If you lock them on radar you can read their mach number,  however generally you can just fly up to them and visually slow down, don't worry about numbers too much
In general, you don't. Turning up SAS helps counter some of the effects at the cost of the manuverability, but its a helicopter, it spins by nature, you have to counter yaw
Can't spin out if you don't take off :itsfreerealestate:
Spin out of control, sounds like an RBS. Is it happening as you try to make a turn? The biggest thing is *lower your collective*. You shouldnt keep it at max all the time, as you do hard turns you need to lower it
That will solve 90% of your issues yes
From there its just practice/learning the heli
You can increase teh SAS which makes it more stable, but it comes at the cost of your maneuverability
Stability assist system, its a knob on the left next to the rotor break that is basically a stability assistant
Its relatively new
Technically for dogfighting the AV42c is best
42c > 45 > 26
Just the 42 can never get to the merge if its a BVR lobby
it uses your PC default
combination of RCS and viff
Nah the big thing is it can use AB while viffing
and its got really good RCS
161 dosn't have a DLZ
Hard to say, if your lucky 60nm ish, 40nm is prob pretty good
Keeping the radar lock means even as the target maneuvers the missile gets direction updates
yeah because the missile flies off of the last known direction, if you stop locking and then the guy you shot at changes direction, the missile has no idea that they changed direction and likely won't find him
By keeping a lock, when they change direction your aircraft tells the missile that they changed direction so the missile updates the path
The missile seeker has a fairly low FOV, so if you loose lock as long as they don't change direction, it will still find them, but if they turn it will miss
The longer you keep the lock, the higher risk, but the better the pK
the DLZ?
nan
Don't use AP in general, if needed lower sensitivity
With throttle the idea of "put in input, then take half of it out" works really well for me
Practice with slow stedy movments
if you get flustered/shaky, back off of the boon for a moment and re-steady yourself in a pre-contact position
Throttle up
at 65 knots pull back smootly and steadily
make sure to hold left rudder to prevent the induced yaw as needed, more throttle -> more left rudder
keep the wings level and climb away from the runway
Hold 86 knots while climbing at full throttle
if you are going too fast, pitch up
if you are going too slow, pitch down
continue at that speed until you reach your desired altitude
Congratulations, you've flown
@Auber ^
Baha is very receptive to suggestions in #public_testing, it seems his current focus is elsewhere so its unlikely that we'll see feature changes to the heli right now but it'll never happen if you don't suggest it
Nah id just post it as a message
He made a comment a week or two ago that he wanted to wrap up the current PTB batch to get it onto stable, so yeah bugfixes seem to be focus
ah, "a week or two ago" was a nearly two months ago :risitas:. Alas is the struggle of game dev
But, there's a lot of great bug fixes and some super nice QoL so I am very excited
ARAD on horizon line please I beg ill do anything
I mean showing RWR contacts on your HUD the same way all the aircraft do
But, a nerfed version
The issue with ground vehicles is they don’t integrate with aircraft at all
A tank exists in a tank world with zero hope of even seeing a jet before an AGM hits it from 20nm away
145 launched from 40k ft easily makes it 45nm
So launched from a more reasonable altitude 20nm is still well within the valid range
Now obviously down low you’ll get less still but still to the range that the tank won’t even see it
Even helis get hundreds of tank kills with nearly zero hope for the tanks
No
Those both have specifically error logs
Normally means the lobby closed
The missile sill continued even after you’ve lost lock
But also, once the missile pitbulls you can defend with no issue
You don't have to keep the lock/pointed at them the entire time
you can turn away early
If they are higher/faster than you their missile will reach first
Getting into the air is likely a practice thing
I run a 12 by 6 loadout with 6kL of fuel
12 AIM-120s, 6 heaters
there can be a lot of factors that effect detection range
the biggest one is RCS
so the weapons you have, and the orientation of your aircraft
radar cross section, basically different parts of the aircraft reflect different amounts  of radar back
Keep your nose pointed directly at the target, thats the minimum crossection for all the aircraft
There's others that also effect detection range, a quick one that can help is generally being below someone gives you a better detection range than them
but of course, that limits your missile range
Situational, generally I prefer missile range
I tend to wait to fire anyways even after detecting them, so who locks who first dosn't really matter to my general playstyle
RCS matters much more than altitude anyways
Basically, whenever you need more lift
if im light I do flaps1 carrier landings
if im heavier, in order to maintain an 8AOA I use 2
yeah
pings *only* mean the radar sweeped acrossed you, its fully unlinked to if the radar detected you
Now, if you are *locked* by the radar then yes you can assume it sees you
np
ye
Notching *works* while locked, but due to the STT buff its way harder compared to pre-lock
So chaff to break the lock and then notch to prevent reacquire
and then get reacquired anyways bcs of how chaff works
Nah my issue is *chaff* not notching
I think notching is great as is rn
The only issue is 120s sometimes seem to have magic
Beam is the 90 degrees, notching is beaming with terrain behind you to fool the missile with doppler shift
When you use chaff, you *are* notching if there is terrain behind you
But if you are in open sky you are just *beaming*, not *notching*
You can still use chaff in open sky, so without a notch
.
Chaff is useless without a *beam*
its 100% usable without notching
nan
Open sky, no notching ^
Thats more-so just me complaining about how chaff lasts for so little time right now
Notching isn't perfect, and chaff stays around for so little time that it means your unable to really use it to say, get closer to terrain
But yes if your low to the ground and chaff off a missile, you'll likely be fine because your in a notch
No but the effects of it was way more prominent due to how radars react to chaff
My complaint is it encourages last-second defending
And if im going to defend last-second, the better choice is nearly always G-pulling which is bad imo
flaps-1 anytime your in a merge
Sometimes situationally
if im particularly high-alt or particularly slow ill sometimes switch to 2
noooo
thats the exact opposite of what you want to do
As you start doing a high-G turn your bleeding off all your energy, you need max throttle to get that energy back
Hard to say without seeing the exact situation you are thinking off, but flaps should always be 1
if you have the energy to pull your nose at them then normally thats what you wnat to do
Flaps increase drag, but the benefit of the added lift/maneuverability from flaps 1 outweighs its drag
flaps 2 gives you *more lift* but the drag grows to the point where its not *always* the best option, where as the flaps 1 drag is so little that its always worth it
yeah when I load in I switch to 1 instantly
Only for BFM lobbies ^
BVR flaps are a detriment
BFM = basic fighter maneuvers aka dogfighting
BVR = beyond visual range, aka using missiles/AIM-120s/long range shots
The radar is a flashlight, the RWR is an eye. Closing your eyes dosn't change anything for the flashlight looking for you
Similarly, your eyes are able to see the light of the flashlight from a much farther range than the flashlight can see you
At 30k ft the air is so thin that you'll get the stall warning very quickly. You'll want to pull back less on the stick to prevent it, or to be going faster
The "stall warning" on its own really dosn't mean anything, it just means your AoA is greater than 17
So, either go faster, turn slower, or be at a lower altitude
At 30k ft, 500 knots is like flying at 300 knots at sea level, but also due to the altitude your engines produce less thrust
np
If they are bad at managing their speed, something like this works, otherwise your basically fucked without help https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/429501682670370827/1002321617810104461/manage-your-energy.mp4
No, a cobra is quite a bit different (my max aoa was only like 20). Basically it’s a steady easy (5g) turn until they are close enough/in the correct position, then it’s a hard out-of-plane maneuver dropping throttle and max AB
I dropped from 500 knots to 200
Only works if you have a decent amount of airspeed to start
Just practice tbh
I use 1.0 sensitivity
Yeah
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/429501682670370827/987191343010955294/what-happens-when-topgun-name.mp4
Similar maneuver with different starting conditions ^
The goal is to be turning out of their plane of motion
No that’s how you get them to overshoot, basically you want to turn in a different direction than them
And as they try to follow you, continuing making it so they have to turn a different direction
There's some things in general that can help, but its like an FPS game asking how to aim better, at the end of the day, practice. Generally tho, slow things down, take a second or two to steady your aircraft before firing. As you fire, I like to start at the back of the aircraft and do a small increase in G to lead my pipper up the aircraft.
Only fire in very small bursts, half second trigger pulls or so
Also if your bullets tend to land short, you'll have to lead a bit "extra". In some cases the gun lead calculation isnt perfect. You'll get better at knowing how much you need to lead with practice
> head-track locked on HARM Thats why you died :risitas:
HARMs only get updated when you ping them, locking them tells the HARM exactly where you are/gives it updates very quickly lol
yea if you break the lock they are trivial to dodge
I locked a harm the other day but instantly panicked and turned off my radar entirely
high speed antiradiation missile
Basically, an AGM that targets a radar
Thats because you are trying to do a hard-turn with the collective up, and causing something called RBS
Lower your collective into a turn
as for letting go of the controller - don't
you can *technically* trim the helicopter so it remains stable however the trim settings are almost never going to be perfect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhRD8mTsiQ if you watch my collective you can see anytime I do a turn I lower it
ish, I guess thats not a great vid to show it
All
I don’t believe there’s a way to prevent that
Sypwn really tried to prevent that lol, the altitude is meant to make vertical takeoff difficult
You’ll have to take a lesser fuel load
Likely no, Baha made a comment about not needing worse airframes
#off-topic
You can give the ASF-30 an AIM-7 equivalent and a rear aspect missile
I’m not to sure about that tbh, vtol BFM is heavily dominated by whoever has the smaller turn circle due to how tight the fights are
And how much aircraft bleed energy no matter what you do
Against AI it *is* already super dissimilar, their aircraft behave a lot differently than ours
At least the ASF
#off-topic or #vtolvr_chat, not here
To be fair in symmetric aircraft BFM 1v1 you can have lots of interesting/more complex fights
Iv had plenty of pure 1 circle fights, or fights that switch between
Pub lobbies are very very very different. I rarely “dogfight” in those lobbies as one turn and I’m behind the other guy
In 1v1s things like energy do matter, less so than other games but still
It’s especially noticeable in a rate fight, the winner is almost always the person better at managing energy
My experience tends to be different, things like dumping your nose, easing on the pull while doing down etc etc do matter quite a bit. In fights iv had iv made mistakes, and my enemy has made mistakes and the fight continues. Now, this assumes your fighting someone on roughly the same skill level as you
I never fight above 10k. 10k is my preferred merge altitude
3x fuel burn rate
3x
Well
AB is 3x however the increased throttle position means it might end up as more than 3x
its noisy
Fuel has weight, and with less weight you'll go faster, so yes
What you learn first dosn't matter, just learn
the 42c or 26b are typically considered the easiest/best to learn first
What you learn first dosn't matter, just learn
What you learn *second* matters even less
Yeah the aircraft in vtol are super simple to learn, the 94 is the "hardest" but even then its difficulty is just in fine control
Its a simple game to pickup
but there's lots of depth
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLWW-bbyfJEuQnnMmhSoCq39m3Ge5fxL11G_qbVDd88/edit
Hold trigger on the throttle
Chaff is extremely usefull
that was chaff
Nah shadow is correct, that was over-G
id be shocked if you got more than 10nm
the 120s radar is really weak
it dosnt even show on RWR until like 15nm
sure lol
But *in general*
Technically given the correct situation your able to get like a 500nm lock
not below, I believe its only above
TSD and some DL features are pretty major lol
Also sensor integration such as slaving tgp to arad or radar
Yeah, that was C lol
That’s the “notch circle” he’s talking about
You can do that
You can TWS up to 4 targets at a time
You can
Missiles can be guided in TWS mode, and while STTed TWS contacts keep updating
Yeah but that’s no different than the F16 where you have to designate something as a PDT
It’s probably because there’s no other simple UI interface
You don’t loose other TWS
Yeah I dunno maybe could work, I think click causes PDT, hold causes STT could be good
I… uh, i never touch scan angle and I never have issues getting contacts
If a contact isn’t tws’ed I nearly never care about it
26b?
It has a knob on the center console
That’s because they briefly had a high RCS, but that dosnt really matter because your not going to be shoot at targets that far away
Anyways the STT to fire dosnt have an effect there because you only need the STT for a millisecond
Radar has a fixed amount of energy it puts out per second, as it’s tracking TWS contacts at a high rate it has to slow tne scN
Sure but it makes sense to baha
It’s sorta an AESA
Otherwise there’s no way to explain TWS contacts updating at the rate they do
Perhaps it’s got two semi-independent radars
The TWS radar and the scan radar
Even a mech scanned should be able to
There’s a lot of things the 26 *should* be able to do that it can’t. VTOl isn’t IRL, we make comparisons as much as possible but some things just are vtol
The 26 should have a better radar than the 45
You can swap with hotas
And you can un-stt with hotas
TWSed contacts are still shown in STT
Yeah but also clicking anywhere on the screen will unstt
While I’d still like a PDT system, iv never had that be an issue
Ironically in code there are two different radars
There’s a “Radar” and “LockingRadar”
I don’t think “radar” has STT logic in it
I don’t think there’s ever a “lockingRadar” on its one without a “radar” as well
There are some “Radar”s on their own but those are pure search radars
Yeah?
Emoji spam is still spam :Think:
Google isn’t perfect
The game does not even support a physical HOTAS
all you can use is the virtual hardware, and rudder pedles if you have them
imo yes
especially for the heli
Yeah when you have pedals hooked up the stick dosnt twist at all automatically
Iv never heard that personally
PIO is much more of a thing in the fixed wing than in the heli
@newgen333 Here's sort of an example of what I was talking about. In the first merge im in a very much loosing situation. He got around quicker, and has much better nose placement compared to me, but, just because I messed up the merge dosn't mean iv lost. Bcs we are both so slow its not just a case of point nose at target and win
That zeros *trim*, a trim button sets trim so that your current stick input *is* the trim point
The bottom box is the MAR (not burn time), the upper part means the missile is physically capable of getting to that range with the energy to kill the target, its not *really* about g's
the missile dosn't know MADDOG when you turn code, it continues onto the PIP and then enables its radar like it normally would with the 7 degree scan cone
Turning away has zero effect on range as long as the target dosn't change direction
the issue is if the target changes direction
Missiles only maddog if you fire them as maddog
^
don't
it also doesn't have guidance, dosn't loft, and has an extremely small chance of finding the target
You should nearly never fire it as maddog
:Agony: no close range is where they do the *worst*
6 seconds to fire, 1 second it flies in a straight line without guidance, then it enables its radar, continues to fly in a straight line, if you get lucky and it picks up it probably needs to make a massive turn so it will miss
if you need close range, use boresight mode head slaved
no
bad
stop
Use boresight head mode
but don't
One does not exist
There's no "most reliable"
its 100% situational
I guess the "most reliable" is put terrain between you and the missile
sure
still
when your super close generally you can just use a high-G pull
120s aren't hugely manuverable off the rail
All it is used for is the visible laser line when you have NVGs on
Like you noticed, its not required for laser guided weapons, there's an invicible laser thats always on that does that
the MARK button just enables the visible one
No
it tends to underestimate
Uhh its like 130 damage tho I thought a tank was like 100, I can't chekc rn
Which/what?
Im not sure exactly what you are describing
that bit of HUD shows two different things, at the top there is the dot, which you want to center between the two lines
Then below that is the TADS field of regard
the smaller box is where the TADS can see
the bigger box is its max view angle/area
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lqzTVwUR9a_wMWRfbedmJvLsgl216z6c3NusHfHXy2E/edit?usp=sharing
Normally dogfighting
You can make your turn circle 0ft
Get da photo
Yea
If you switch to head mode you can press forward/backward
Only if it’s in head mode
There’s no other free controls so
Yeah you click down the stick
Same way you select things on radar
It’s a helicopter, the big spinniny thing on tne top makes you spin the other direction
Basically as you increase collective you increase the torque
So you have to counteract that using yaw
No there’s only a single primary rotor blade
You are thinking of a helicopter with two counter rotating blades
That’s not engine two, that’s the tail rotor, both rotors are connected to both engines through a single drive train
But yes that’s what it’s there for, but it’s not automatic
You have to yaw to counteract it
Yeah they are directly correlated
That being said, the faster you go, the less counter yaw you need as the helicopter has vertical stabilizers
Yeah, but you can use trim to change the 0 point to make it easier
Using either the joystick on tne cyclic for the cyclic, or using the joystick on the flight collective for yaw trim
No
One trims cyclic
One trims yaw
Cyclic is the joystick input, so pitch and roll
Yaw is the pedal input, so, yaw
Automation is expensive and complex, why automate something they pilot easily can do
Why have something additional when the fail safe works better
yes by quite a large margin
TWS is the default/automatic for the F-45
The TSD maintains tracks on every target the radar hits
If you'd rather the radar switch to STT, you can open the RADAR drop down on teh TSD, and select "POINT"
Likely your hitting the carrier at some absurd angle or trying to pull away from the wires
The radar also has a GPS-S button
Click the joystick in
Same way you select things on the radar
It’s a lil bit different depending on your controller
Yeah
yaw in the other direction
you can visually see the smoke trail
additionally, you know where they spawn and how fast their jet is so you can calculate roughly how close to you they are
so you know when to defend
there's a certain amount of heat produced just for moving through the air
Engines do take a moment to cool, but its quick
few seconds at most
Engine tempeture and response to throttle is surprisingly complex, iv been wanting to create a vtol engine sim to see all the things like elec power, temp, thrust, fuel rate, throttle responce etc etc
I mean iv created ones for chaff and the radars lol
the FFA is going to want a word with you
FAA FFA same difference
Fuck fun agency
kek
Yeah just 8AoA, once you get that most of your issues tend to solve themselves
you can carrier land without gear
I believe you skid too much on regular runways, but because the carrier is moving 30knots your aircraft *can* survive
You can fire two AGM-89s, that sometimes helps, also you can create a GPS path so that you hit the cruiser from a different angle
yeah when I played I could only have 1 as well, but I remember seeing someone bring two
SSEvasive is the best yeah
if its not working try a path that comes from the back/side
You can’t reboot it, you were running the engine starter on it, which spins it up to 30% (dunno if it’s actually that, but some low %), however it will never produce energy
I believe the clutch remains disconnected, so it’s not putting any power into the system even if it appears to be rotating
Clutch only connects once the engine is actually running
You’ll notice the starter light will never go out
You have more than enough for out of ground effect with a single engine (you can hover with full hydra load with one engine), the issue normally is blade damage
Blade damage is a killer due to the missing bits not producing lift of course, but the unbalanced blade producing heavy torque forces
That would be fun lol
You *can* notch/chaff, but generally no, don't be in an open field/without cover
I struggle to chaff in the heli, its hard to get your velocity vector exactly where its needed
Notching generally needs to be done before the missile/radar locks onto you
chaff really is only useful in a beam
unlike notching, which is dependent on closure rate, chaff effectiveness only cares about the velocity *direction*, not its magnitude
Yeah, *notching*
Chaff != notching
different mechanics that effect radars differently
Not quite
Notching and chaff have no connection and work completly differently
Yes and no, the goal of chaff is to confuse the radar and make you hard to track, so its not about background or what not, but the issue is the radar can use the doppler effect to *filter out* the chaff, so you need to use it in a beam so that the chaff and aircraft both return the same way. This is *simular* to notching, however teh difference is with notching the radar looses you in the background, with chaff the radar dosn't *loose you*, it thinks the chaff is you. This means you can partially confuse the radar so that it thinkts you are a bit behind where you really are (you can sometimes see your radar lock box jump around due to this). Or, chaff can fully break the lock where hte radar locks onto the chaff, however a few seconds later the chaff will have dispersed/expanded too much, and the radar goes back into a search mode
Both notching and chaff rely on the fact that the closure rate is low, but they operate quite differnetly and the radar handles them quite differently
In practice for VTOL, chaff only cares about *aspect* where notching cares about *closure rate*
And they are totally isolated/different systems
Notching effects general total lockability, gets easier with distance, and will cause the radar to fully drop without a degraded track
Chaff has no effect on aircraft lockability, dosn't *really* change with distance (due to lock-cone FOV, it is easier from farther, but for different reasons), and can cause a degraded track due to the false contact
Beaming is flying with the missile on your 3/9 line
Well
Notching is beaming but with terrain behind you to fool the radar due to doppler
Beaming = the maneuver you do, notching = the tactic to fool the radar
Beaming is *how* you notch
Notching can be done *without* beaming, as long as you slow down
as notching cares about *closure rate*
Beaming and notching are related in the same sense that a high-yoyo is related to BFM. In order to notch, *beaming* (plus getting terrain behind you) is how you *notch*
Beaming is the manuver inorder to *notch*
But, just because you are beaming, dosn't mean you *are* notching
notching requires terrain behind you
They have fundemental differences in how the radar handles it
the missile knows your last position/velocity, so even if it losses you, it will go to that predicted point
however, with chaff, because it thinks the chaff is you, the position/velocity it sets is on the chaff
So chaff ends up fooling the missile *more* than just notching/the radar loosing you
nan
This is aspect
Basically their aircraft orientation related to you
there you can see beaming
nan
Basically, if the aircraft is coming directly at you, it is "hot"
if its going away from you its "cold"
if its flying perpendicular to you, its "beaming"
closure rate means how quickly the two aircraft are coming togeather
vC
Aspect and airspeed
And technically whats important for notching is not exactly *closure rate*, but instead relative ground speed
You want the closure rate to be equal to their airspeed to notch
In practice for all of this, its achived by flying a 90 degree angle from them
Well when you fly 90deg, you achive that
nan
Actually lemme use different numbers
nan
Nothing in practice lol, either way you want to go into a beam
They do!
But their use is nearly the same
However they have very different effects on the missile
Knowing the different effects can be useful to understand
and the heli can quite easily notch without being in abeam
Yeah for notching
However, chaff and notching work fundamentally differently, notching cares about closure rate, chaff cares about aspect
Around mach4 yeah
Ofc that assumes high alt
And the patriot is equivalent to the MAD-4
roughly
Yes its active radar homing, its the red "M" you see on your RWR when missiles get close to you
The AIM-7 does not
ALso, missiles guide in TWS, so you don't have to hold a STT the whole time
the missile itself goes to space tho
Yeah the GBU-53 seems to be its primary close-ish range AG weapon, tho iv heard glide bombs have pretty insane ranges IRL
and then you have things like LRASM for higher standoff
It seems the IRL meta is shifting to glidebombs over AGMs for your short to medium AG role
At least from jets, helicopter obviously needs the rocket
I think strike happens way way more often than CAS (F-15Es drop *thousands* of bombs per deployment, I doubt they need that much CAS lol)
But yeah, you don't need the range normally
and glide bombs already give decent range
kek
make sure you have an 8aoa and land on the wires, not before them
Really? Iv never heard a bulls call before
I’m pretty sure no comms will ever give bulls
I mute awacs anyways do I dunno
Oh I mute my team as well
The non-team knob does control AWACS tho, so you can still hear your team if you mute just that
Yeah hydras op
Yeah
Allied carrier can't be killed by hydras due to the armor
1.04 is too low iirc
also may be altitude
I'd *guess* it uses TWR at altitude
that means your TWR is too low
rounding is better than flooring for a user
its really not
Its base armor level is higher than the hydra damage, so I believe so
can you post a player log?
also give log
thx
the mod loader isn't the issue here its fine
You are getting timed out, seems like a network issue somewhere
I don't remember resolving timeout issues recently
Which one specifically are you talking about?
They had a different error I thought, but also I have no idea how they fixed it, I gave up lol
come in slowly
flaps
put the velocity vector where you want to touch down
shortly before touching down ease back on the stick a bit
what?
nan
this is a valid alternative
what type of missile are you using?
are you pointing your TGP at something?
Yeah the AGM-114 is a laser guided missile, you have to point your TGP at something. You do not need MARK
np
cost and fun
1 = 50%, 2 = 100%
Flaps generally are a way to increase lift at the cost of drag, so they let you fly slower while maintaining a lower AoA
Normally they are used for takeoff and landing
They can also be used in a dogfight for additional turn rate
*Generally* yes, but there's no set in stone rules here, its all situational. Do you need more lift/lower AoA? Then increase flaps.
If im in an unloaded 26b I typically land flaps1
but if im heavier, ill do 2
Yeah flaps 1 is my normal unloaded carrier landing
your prob going too fast
no
The RWR only shows radar pings, an IR missile does not have a radar so it won't show
Yeah the MWS shows on the same panel
To explain a bit, the "RWR" display actually shows two independent systems that both display over each other on that screen they are: **RWR - Radar warning receiver**, displays any radar energy that passes over your plane (scanning or locking), the first occasional pinging you hear is their radar scan passing over your aircraft as it scans the sky, the continous tone is when the target locks you, that is, the radar energy is being constantly sent at you. Finally you have the active radar homing warning, which is a more urgent tone and the target will be denoted with a red "M" on the RWR.   **MWS - Missile warning system**, displays nearby missiles, it does this by looking for the thermal signature of missile rocket motors. It has two warnings, "launch warning" when the initial kick/thrust of a missile is detected, or the "missile warning". Launch warning is a yellow semi-circle on the outer ring of the RWR display, and missile warning is the two orange lines that shows more precisly where a nearby missile is. The RWR is 100% consistant and will never miss something, where the MWS can be very inconsistant due to blindspots and the missiles having cooled down
depends on the heat of the missile
Cranking is much more about increasing a missiles total travel distance than directly causing energy loss due to turns. Now it’s also useful as the missile isn’t following a pure-intercept path so it ends up having to turn as well bleeding it more
If your in a situation where you are purely trying to bleed it (ie, your cold to it) a barrel roll could be used, but you bleed a lot of your own energy while doing it, and the additional “turn” it does is not worth it compared to a traditional S-turn
Often you’ll crank in one direction for a while, then change directions and crank the other way, changing pitch on that reverse can be useful to force it to turn more, but it’s not a barrel role
Barrel roll also dosnt leave you going on direction for enough time
Because S turns are much more like a sawtooth to bleed energy
You want to hold a direction for a second or two to force the missile to turn more/harder
I mean maybe? But I still think you’d be bleeding your own energy quite a bit for not enough benefit
If at any point the distance between you and the missile increases, the missile goes dumb, so you really want energy to defeat it as quickly as possible
Lower the collective
when you turn, you should reduce the collective. The harder you turn, the more you need to reduce it
MADDOG AIM-120s are terrible and will nearly never get you, are you sure your having to dodge MADDOG AIM-120s?
Most people I meet online call the F-45's AIM-120D a "maddog", which is incorrect
Without warning at all?
Or,  no warning until the red M appears?
Completly no warning means it was an IR missile in your MWS blindspot, but thats rare, I suspect more often your just not getting any warnign until the red M
if a missile shows up randomlly as a red M with no warning before hand, then its an F-45 missile
There’s no way to know if you’ve been soft locked, but you’ll get pings slightly slower because their scan rate went down
Dosnt prove that they’ve soft locked *you*, but does prove they’ve soft locked *someone*
Yeah TWS lil bit magic
the best current explination is there are two radars
one scanning, and one locking
this is actually consistant with how its implemented in code
the scanning is a regular mechscanned, the locking is an AESA
no
Your just bleeding your own airspeed
All an airbreak does is show you down, so if you need to slow down it should be done *before* the high-G manuvers
https://media.giphy.com/media/DCII5Q5q0bYPbh6x6p/giphy.gif
It has the same total effect yes
When you pull the bail your pilot opens the side door and jumps directly up
but baha decided that was too graphic so it blacks out your screen
(this is a long whinded way to say it just kills you)
Its for preventing nausea caused by the spinning from loosing your tail
you can disable auto-bail
also, you can just... not pull the bail handle
Yeah
Ah
Well
fair enough
Ill work out an alternative story
stability assist system, basically a flight control augmentation that helps keep the heli stable
the increased stability comes at the cost of manuverability
Depends on the lobby your in
Yeah its not *super* common but does happen
You can always host your own lobbies, then *you* can be the one kicking people who kill you :itsfreerealestate:
oof
I recommend hosting a builtin for at least a match then switching the mission once its in debrief
Chaff dosn't care if there's terrain behind you
In a perfect beam
yeah
nan
And the radar is only checking a 3 degree cone around you, the chaff needs to be within that
I think its roughly the same IRL, exadurated in vtol
Chaff itself barely moves
Only important thing to know is put missile 3/9, press chaff, wiggle a bit
I think I was wrong, it seems that when you are TWSed you'll get pings twice a second consistently
Well I meant IRL
but yes for vtol
Oh yeah ofc
yes
Running theory is the 26b has an AESA and a mech scanned, the AESA is used for locking (including TWS) and the mech scanned does initial detection
while tracking/locking the AESA is running more a longer amount of time, so the mechscanned has to go slower
if the other two work together and know what they are doing, no
you run out of fuel
The problem with this question is you are asking “what’s the best strat aside from the two best strats”
By the time you’ve made it to *third best* it’s too situational
It just takes a ton of practice to know what to do when, every time you die try to identify why you died
Yes and no, issue is if you don’t have weapons got often end up dead shortly
Currently this is the output of trying to read my own recording file so :harold:
thats the output of the deserialization code :harold:
it no worky
no idea why
Honestly, I think so
Im also wondering if I somehow used an old version of my compression code
idfk
I only just added versioning, so I think the version it used was without the versioning lmao
Yeah ends up being about 16x better than JSON
Size
Both for long-term storage, and for sending over the network I wanted to optimize for size. Its also not that slow so thats a plus
I dunno, it seems to break when I read the RPC Count so im wondering if its reading the 64bit number incorrectly
Uhh im trying to remember why I did it like this lmao
I had a reason
I swear
I think its because I used the same function for converting unix timestamps as the RPC count as it can be a high-number so I needed a high bit count int, but not sure why I chose to reuse *this* method rather than like a 32bit int. Probably dealing with JS and everything just being a `number`
Don't mind my extremely good variable naming, calling a float64 an "i32"
I have them!
I mean, like one test
better than nothing
nan
*better than nothing*
Uhh its just in its own js file called `compressionTest` that I just run anytime I made changes kek
:risitas:
Ok yea it was using the old compression code, I pulled the old from github and now it works :stonks:
I mean that also means its missing some important information (such as timestamps) but ima just guess, I know each packets time to within 30 seconds and ill just lerp them in that range kek
sorta, to replay lobbies I just straight up save every packet id normally send to the client and replay them, normally I use the timestamp to know when to play it
But I store in 30 second chunks so ill use that to estimate timestamp
Neat, good to know the way im doing it isnt totally crazy
Yeah I just have a few specific custom parts for handling "undoing" some things, such as spawns or deaths (for being able to rewind the replay), other than that it needed nearly no modification
I might need to recreate this for locking onto chaff, this graph is for chaffs effect on predicted position/velocity before chaff itself could be locked
it locks onto chaff for a second or two
Normally you chaff a missile and by the time its back in search mode its too close/past you so it can't relock
if you chaff it off far away then notching is useful
Chaff is extremely good
nan
Depends on if there's a red `M` on your RWR or not
Red M means there is a radar guided missile tracking you
if a radar turns from green to red and starts flashing that means it fired a SARH missile at you
could be an F-45 AIM-120D in that case
So does the 94, got killed by a GAV the other day
sorta yeah
it does but RCS is irrelevent to chaffs effectiveness, and you only care about chaff after the missile has locked you
The current meta for vtol *is* to intentionally show your belly/open bay door in order to force the missile to lock sooner
That was the RCS bug, now the meta is opening your bay doors so that you drop the DL guidance and can use chaff
Well more typically just rolling 90deg to show your belly as that tends to be easier
DAS + MWS would still get it
ye
Aircraft do not have infinite, they have to land to rearm. SAMs/ground units have limited however the mission designer can configure how long it takes them to replenish their ammo
(they can set it to 0 replenish time so they always have ammo)
No idea
fuel is not ammo
thats like saying the aircarft has infinite oil, its true but irrelevant to the discussion
That’s pretty common especially given that most players have no idea how to dodge a missile
Intercepting seems likely, Gpulling is also possible at that altitude you just gotta be fast
Also chaff
Yeah I don’t recommend really doing it at altitude
Or don’t be at that altitude lol
Your missile is pretty good at climbing
But also yeah just practice chaff
Easily, consider that 30k ft is only like what… 3nm?
A missile can easily travel 30nm, so 3 up is easy
Also once you fire you can dive down
It gives your missile a lot more range
Iv met some people who think running only AIRS-Ts is a good idea lmao
Oh yeah def but iv never seen someone try that, its always just them attempting to intercept :risitas:
Tho there was someone in a low-tech lobby trying to use exclusively hydras on me which was very confusing
He kept pushing to a merge without shooting back at me, didn't realize why until I saw the parallel smoke trails without a MWS warning
Would at least spook me :risitas:
Waffle fired a 145 at someone in the VRCL match so we can call it an official top-level tactic now
yea
which, in itself is useful, forces them to defend a missile that dosnt exist
in that one map, freeflightguns I always carry a shit load of 145s and ripple them at people just to scare them
Iv killed manuvering fighters in a dogfight with a 145
its pK is just *tiny* lmao
Well its not *hard* per say
points EOTS at target, fire 24 AGM-145s
VTOL has nearly no RNG
Don't be at 30k ft lol
Flaps 2 is unlikely to help, maybe a *tiny* bit but the extra drag is worse, you should be flaps 0 for BVR
Start high altitude, fire a missile, then go into a crank while descending so that their missile is driven into thicker atmo and you have better manuverability
The "normal" BVR flow is  -> Climb high -> Fire -> Crank and dive -> Turn cold -> Turn hot and climb -> repeat   Now in VTOL the BVR flow changes a lil bit with things that let you remain hot the whole time or the use of terrain
but the theory still follows
Don't fire maddog AIM-120s
*Especially* if they are close
thats possibly the worse time to fire them
:shut:
We normally do it to waste missiles
because 99% of the time its just a total waste of a missile
because its extremely unlikely to find its target, and even if it does its unlikely to hit
yes there *is* a use case for a maddog in that 1%
but its very niche
Most of the time in comp matches we fire off a bunch then turn around because we are going to rearm
no point of taking missiles back to rearm
This is really the *only* situation a maddog is good https://clips.twitch.tv/ObeseTenaciousCarrotEleGiggle-fU-3HKg51oKiFuWQ
Because I had DL on him, I knew where and when he would pop up so I was able to prefire
Its still really low pK, the timeing has to be just about perfectly right
and it dosn't work great on F-45s
I wanted to try to merge with someone and hard-yank on the stick to fire an AIM-9 as they passed lol
the AIM-9 can TSD-slave right? Or at least it should be able to radar slave and the radar slaves to the TSD, so it should be possible without having to try to get your head pointed right at them
Something like that, its harder to check code than to check in game
Yea so you just gotta be in POINT
Yeah I doubt intentionally positioning for a blindspot is worthwhile
smart pilots keep their head on a swivel anyways
Ah yeah why don't the devs just press the bring back button
I can't believe how lazy they are
You got the whole squad laughing
Same """"joke"""" only been made about 300 times so far
No, radar is controlled generally by the TSD
You use the TSD for targeting selection
Technically the correct comment is “[Aircraft name] ball [fuel in thousands]”
So like, “Wasp ball 3.4”
In a dogfight? Never. You might call bulls for your own location but dogfight assumes close proximity
But, for AWACS and what not talking to your flight, yes you’ll get bulls
Just requires some practice/training to get used to
And things like DL help a lot with that
> Do general BVR combat rules apply to VTOL Yep, ranges/values/timings may be different, but the general concepts still apply
Ehh
You can still very easily pass out, the g limiter is to protect the plane
No
Radar detection dosn't care about if the other aircrafts radar is on
It heavily reduces your maneuverability when its on
Rotor blades are not included in the RCS/radar calculation for vtol
public test branch
Canary/ptb/stable are all branches
if you notch pre-lock you can do it even with a bunch of hardpoints
Yeah pylons apply RCS uniformly everywhere, position does not matter
Right so notch before they STT
aka, notch anytime your in line-of-sight
I mean the real option is your in a helicopter don't be in open-air without terrain
yes, but also notching isn't perfect, if they get close they'll still detect you
Anyways newgen im still convinced chaff not working is a skill issue lol
It'd have to be some suuuuper niche bug to effect the heli differently
I havn't tried, will when I get home in a few days
the 89 has an MWS it should dodge
As long as the missile gets there within like 3-4 minutes, you're fine
if its missing you can try to create a path that comes up behind the boat
Is it? The motor lasts for 5 minutes
nan
I have a newer video somewhere but yeah anything moving through the air produces heat and its enough for them to lock onto
I leave now bye
it just cranks
It might not actually have a MWS, it has the capability to be equiped with both RWR and MWS but iirc it only has one of them
it has intelligent missile evasion
There’s no formation autopilot no
You can assign alt, speed, and heading APs
Ehh if I wanted to see the plane fly itself I’d watch YouTube
The ARAD marker dosnt contain ranging information, so you have to basically guess how far the missile is. A good way to get a feel for it is see how quickly it changes relative bearing, but generally if just takes practice
I think it’s just catapult take off
Or actually more likely, “Carrier Take-Off”, or at least that’s what it seems to be a for an F18
Technically not above it
The 45s blindspot is two narrow channels sort of 10 and 2 slightly angled up
I know some about both those things, but what specifically is the question
Has to be, no
The missile gets the best performance when you do tho as it dosnt have to do a big turn
Yeah AIm-7s get a much bigger relative boost compared to tne 120
You want to put the circle over the dot
If someone is on your 6, you are as good as dead against any competent pilot, the best option is simply don’t let them get there
You’ll want to keep your eyes on them and stay away from their nose, make out-of-plane pulls and jinks
Yeah generally your best bet is to stay alive long enough for a teammate to help
If they don’t know what they are doing/are a poor shot/aren’t paying attention you can attempt an overshoot  https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/429501682670370827/987191343010955294/what-happens-when-topgun-name.mp4
But try this against a competent pilot and you’ll die very quickly
Practice more maybe try lowering sensitivity
Throttle down early and pre-flare before the missile is fired
it will not avoid terrain
Radar rather than nav is cursed
NAV plus POINT mode on the radar
I never turn point mode off
Can't you just undesignate the target so it stops STTing?
Designate to integrate/check track validity, undesignate to scan
Generally when I turn radar on in the F-45 im trying to get data on one specific person quickly so I find point mode to be better in general. Radar MFD is good, but I prefer not having to look down
You should put the GPS point *on* the boat not 1nm away
No, you can switch immediately
When they have the number next to them they are "TWS"ed, when you select them you "STT" them, but TWS contacts keep updating
you only need to keep the target TWSed, so with the number next to it
Yeah
Tracking, neither
However its harder to *loose* an STT
Its a game mechanic
TWS gets a 2x buff, STT gets an 8x buff
that being said, you have to consider the info they get
in STT, they will know the moment the lock is broken
in TWS, they are kept guessing about if the lock is there or not
I may have said that in the past, but I think im wrong, I need to test. That was true in the past, but an update has likely changed the behavior
It may be, im not 100% sure
At the very least, TWS is very good, there's no worry about its tracking update rate
Iirc TWS is 10x a second
But, its so marginal it does not matter
https://www.wikihow.com/Learn-English
If you mean specific brevity and terms, there's a good list here  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rh2ZlxwtfRvLU1q3uzpQEoHefu8r5HnEGBO4AsEHv0Y/edit
But in general, exact terms and phrases don't matter so as long as everyone understands
you should "crank", that is fly at 60 degrees so that your radar is still tracking them, and you should descend
you don't *need* to, but it very much helps the chance of a kill
if you turn away from your target, they can just change direction a bit and the missile will miss
So the *longer* you keep radar on the target, the better
Flying with the target at your radar gimble limit
so, 60 degrees off
Its the norm for higher-level play, otherwise you'll nearly never kill a skilled player
the solution is don't be a nose-on situation in the open like that
the pK of a single AIM-120 at any range higher than a few miles is very low on its own
a 1v1 will almost always end in a <5mi shot
sounds like your wasting all your missiles lol
why?
and also, you can choose to not shoot
Maybe? The point is you've saved a missile
don't be in a position you have to do that
to win a BVR merge its all about position prediction and terrain usage, pick terrain that favors you and force the merge there, predict the motion of your enemy without being able to see them so that you can fire first then turn to terrain
Ah then tactics change a bit
ocean BVR is less cut and dry, altitude/range are much more important values, understanding the MAR
generally you'll want to get them to defend a bit, then press on that gaining altitude and fireing another missile *before* they turn back to you
Fire missiles spaced out to increase the pK and make G-pulling harder
it sounds like you may be overreliant on G-pulling
Ease of use/stability vs maneuverability/reaction time  SAS improves control/makes it easier to use at the cost of manuverability, choose a SAS as low as possible, but still controllable for you
This setpoint should change over time as you improve
Headless server accidently had a 3d mode for a bit
you visually were in the briefing room looking at the rotating table where you saw your aircraft, but you still physically interacted with the cockpit
Yes, once you've created a GPS point if you press "SEND" on the GPS page they will recieve it (they have to have their GPS page open to get the data)
yea
np
Like most things, its just practice. Faster is always better for dodging missiles
Dodging missiles isn't about turn rate, its about acceleration, aka Gs
Not really, what's the disadvantage to going that fast?
There are some situations in BVR im going that fast, and it makes it very easy to dodge missiles, only risk is over-G so just have to pay attention
degrees per second does not matter for the missile
acceleration is what matters
which is the same either way
Just you, it makes it way easier with the HMD overlay
in the 45 pitbulled missiles are shown on the HMD
its on by default
mmmmmmmm I find it easier lol
Sometimes the issue can be you can't tell *which* missile is the important one
marker update rate
well if they are STTed that dosn't work
But also the bearing rate of the marker
Closer objects = high bearing rate
Also stop being overreliant on Gpulling
practice :shrug:
your going to suck at everything until you practice a ton
50 hours is... more than a good number of people, but these are hard skills and you need a *lot* of practice
Because G-pulling is a low-skill manuver
G-pulling is very easy, just put missile off to side and go to 11Gs
No its far easier than IRL
Oh wait you mean G-pulling, actually arguably G-pulling works *better* IRL, however the issue is missile identification
Its different than the way we do it, its less G-pulling and more just regular kinematic evasion
The line between "kinematic" and "g-pulling" is just how far you do it from the missile
IRL missiles are worse at maintaining their energy/turning, so IRL they can do it from a higher distance
The real issue is IRL you don't have a magic perfect RWR that always tells you where the missile is in 3d space
> - lower than the enemy No, altitude dosn't matter, only that there is terrain "behind" you from perspective of the enemy > - flying slower than 450 knots no, speed dosn't matter, just closure rate > - having your wings and plane perfectly perpendicular at 90 degrees That you have your *velocity* vector perpendicular, wing level dosn't matter. For best results point wintip at target > - deploy chaff while going up and down  Chaff and notching are different
No, chaff and notching are different mechanics with different effects on the missile
I recommend *trying* to chaff at the same time, but they are different things
you can do both at the same time
to use chaff you have to be beaming
its the beaming vs notching question again
beaming is the high-level category, notching is beaming with terrain behind you, chaff is only effective while beaming but has no impact/relation to notching
Outside of a beam? Never
it has zero effect
ehhh beaming =90, notching = beaming + terrain behind you
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/319915885575798785/1011082315730001960/chaff.png
This is the chaff effectiveness graph
Otherway around, notching is pretty friendly with its angles, chaff is very very precise
correct
No you should use it whenever you need to defend
you do not need to maintain a lock until pitbull
it just helps
me too
no
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/429501682670370827/1012230838177513562 Watch this video, right at the end my missile hits the target despite the fact that I lost the lock
to keep getting tracking updates, yes, but it will continue based of the targets last know position/velocity once the lock is no longer maintained
Range does not matter
all that matters is how the target maneuvers
its a game of `pK`, hold lock for longer, higher pK, release early = lower pk
no, because you are just intentionally lowering your pK
situational
depends on who you are fighting, how they are manuvering, how confident you are, range to target etc etc
In the same way you might kill an enemy plane with a dumbomb
The submunitions in vtol are optical, and IFF,  they won't target friends
Oh fuck after editing like 6 times I still fucked up
I meant they won't track aircraft
Its possible
I don't know
parked planes sometime act funny
Parked/taxing behaves differently than flying aircraft
The optical target is specifically targeting anything with the "ground" role, aircraft when flying are basically invisible to it
Gotta convince baha
I don't even need to develop it, baha already made the algo I just gotta feed it data
Anyways HC does data collection, HS is just a pure server
Sounds like PIO, if you find yourself constantly bobbing just release the controls for a second and let the plane steady, back off, and reproach
Pilot induced oscillation
Its a common issue for pilots, small errors become bigger and bigger due to pilot inputs
level vs orbit is up to the mission designer
That tends to be the norm/typical
but the designer can choose others
Honestly I find orbiting to be easier due to how circles work
you don't need a *dead perfect* speed due to circle circumference, change radius and you change relative motion
also makes intercept with the tanker easier
Wouldn’t the best person to record be you :thinkening:
Record your perspective and post it here and we’ll give feedback
Oh wait I have the stupid
I am unable to read
yes notch
Don't G-pull
its possible but very situational
yes you can
iirc water might be a *tiny* bit worse for notching
yes
when was that file last modified?
that log looks like you loaded and played a game, which implies when you are launching the game rn its not starting at all
nan
Right click, go to properties, what do those show ^
Check when the log file was last modified
yeah so the game isn't starting *at all*
dosnt seem like this is a vtol issue
I think I was in your lobby a second ago, and I can assure you it does
Primarially you need to notch *before* a missile pitbulls on you/before a radar locks you
Once something aquires an STT on you it becomes much harder to notch
Nah someone else, my pfp is the same on discord as in game
For AIM-9s?
You mean get the lead indicator?
Im not sure what you are talking about
can you send a photo of what you mean
The lead indicator is automatic
However you can manually command it using the TGP or radar
Yeah just point your nose at a target itll automatically do
Why do you want it to stay in center?
anyways this cross is your gun boresight thats always pointed forward
But, the lead indicator shows you where to put the gun
put the thing on the thing then they dead
Nah just below which is weird given that normally guns are angled up a few degrees
~~for now~~
Ofc not
Im well aware its going to be thrown into suggestion ether
To be fair, except for display management its all one line of code each,  im actually tempted to make it a mod bcs its all very simple
yea but "one that most people aren't aware of"
HOTAS updates are not PVP or PVE!
They effect everyone equally
Also you can always carry 120 of both, so might as well
the planes have switches
the 45 has buttons
ye
Iv legitimately never used CMS switches/toggles
Its *extremely* rare that I run out of CMS, id rather not have to think/deal with it
Yeah everything he listed was optical or laser, GPS bombs can only be used in dumb mode against moving targets which isnt great
You always have to yaw to the left, its a helicopter it likes to spin
thats your slip indicator
Oh wait
I was thinking a different dot
No, the square in the bottom right shows you your current stick inputs, as well as your current trim
the dot is your stick, the vertical line is your yaw, the hollow circle is your cyclic trim, the carret on top is your yaw trim
or twe'ed technically but missiles don't do that
no its tws'ed
No
I use 5-10
Depending on panic level sometimes more
it defiantly is but I refuse to be wrong
Soft lock = TWS Hard lock = STT
STT is when you have the green line through the target, the radar dosn't keep scanning, however TWSed contacts are updated TWS the radar is scanning, and you have a number next to the target
Arguably the simplest is to not get shot at in the first place
You can avoid that situation
This sounds like a joke, but legitimately the first step in missile evasion is minimizing your opponents WEZ. The easiest missile to dodge is the one that stays on your opponents aircraft
Not just range, but also angles/aspects
they can't fire behind them, so go there
120 and 120D are both capable of marking a unit as "detected" so it updates on nav, however it does not provide DL (no TSD)
Press the arrows in the bottom to resize the windows
nan
Click and hold the number in the top left for 3 seconds
Permanently but make sure to do it in single player, sometimes it forgets when you do it in mp
np
Sometimes I invert then pull hard while dropping bombs if thats whats needed to employ
as long as you keep positive Gs its fine
Yes, the A button on your right hand
Climbing is good terminal phase when its really close and you just need to get away from it, before that its best to keep it in thicker air
I think its situational, notching can be required post-notch to prevent instant reacquires
and chaffing an aircraft radar works best when you can then notch their 120s
and often to evade with chaff its far easier if you include notching
assuming you don't get screwed by the notching lol
this is more for the 26, for the 45 yeah 100% high alt = better
issue with effective range is varies *massively*
the AIM-120 has a 200+nm range when employed correctly
AIM-120s and AGM-145s are perhaps the two best examples of altitude+speed effecting range
40k ft like mach 1.5 I think is what the 200nm tests were done at?
40k ft is the normal upper limit, you can go above that but its rare people do. I tend 30k ft as my max combat alt
the DLZ is not a source of truth when it comes to weapon range, don't rely on it
if your goal is to not waste missiles, its pretty good for that
but you can get a feel for the ranges/altitudes and learn your weapons. Use the DLZ as a refrence then make your own judgement around it
it does, poorly so
far better for 120s, rest of the weapons are still pretty inaccurate
AI in many cases can be better than players at avoiding
they still aren't perfect
IR's can't be fired like "MADDOG" unless your in the AH-94 as a gunner
Notching isn't perfect, being low isn't a magic solution
don't get shot at in the first place
the easiest missile to dodge is the one the enemy never shoots
Shoot beyond your enemies range, get behind the enemy so they can't shoot at you, use terrain/cover to hide from the enemy, manipulate your RCS so they can't lock you etc
Also for the purpose of PVP, you won't always have a green circle. Enemies may guide missiles in TWS or F-45s may shoot at you without a lock at all
MADDOG is terrible, do not use it
because they are evading, you aren't
can you post a video?
The F-45 can fire without a lock without maddog mode
refresh discord
Go you your ARAD page and turn HUD on
also look for smoke trails
If the thing shooting at you has a red circle around it and that special noise, its a fox-1 If there's no red circles, and only a MWS warning, its a fox-2 If there's a M with a red circle, its a fox-3
yeah lmao
Britgun is fairly dead
CAW is Carrier Air Wing 8, a vtol community server
That says Freedomplaza wrote that not you?
`Freedomplaza | CAW` != `Freedomplaza`
Well yes, its the proof of my previous statement
Which means it would eval to `true`
:itsfreerealestate:
tf is slip angle v2
top-down velocity indicator
Technically while going backwards your slip angle should be 0
well
maybe not
Top down Acceleration vector
its always been there
Shows the direction of your acceleration top down simular to velocity, often described as a "magnet" for your velocity as the velocity line will tend towards it
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
Because you have a big spinning disk above you, the helicopter is going to want to spin in the other direction
you have to use yaw to counteract that force
I have complete faith in his ability
it does, however it is not automatic
when you input yaw, you are increaseing or decreasing the force that tail rotor outputs
you control the tail rotor, so if you don't do anything, it won't do anything
thats your slip indicator
you want to keep the ball in the center to be in "cordinated flight"
A common tip is to "step on the ball", that is, yaw in the direction of the ball
if you have a damaged 26b its somewhat possible but then results in your death due to impacting the ground
No not in any meaningful way
Actually, to be honest it looks pretty accurate. With such a high AoA commanding a roll left/right would do nothing, there's simply no air going over them, but he *is* inputing yaw as shown on his control surfaces
actually looks like every control surface is pointed the way it should be
Maybe a tiny bit? But given there is a pause between full aft and commanding the roll, it would be a small effect
And the FCS might ignore the roll command due to G-limits
aircraft G-limits change very dynamically as you roll, so a high pitch input may prevent a roll command
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwhjerfaAy0 First video that comes up seems to have the ailerons in the same position, so seems like your right
Its likely the case that locks aren't *broken* by landing, but cannot be acquired while landed (unless f45)
Were you 100% landed wheels down not moving? Just the other day I watched a missile hit me that had the red `M` but it wasn't locked onto me
are you sure it was pitbulled/locked on you? Or was it just scanning?
> This one shows me creeping forward at a pretty slow speed but should be out of the notch If you are any slower than liek 150m/s you are notching to some extent, notching is pretty nice with its require closure rate, so basically below that speed you'll have some amount of notch effect, just depends on how much
Well yeah RCS and closure rate both play into it
low RCS and low closure is best
yea, which is why notching is best pre-lock
Yeah thats the behavior I saw as well
it is
Yep
Its not until the initial lock that the link is broken
Basically lol
another reason why notching is a bad thing in vtol
Issue is if you drop pre-lock the missile will still get guidance
yeah thats a bad thing
Im talkin more specifically for PVP tho, notching PVE generally is fine
no
yes
The 26b can make it without too much trouble, some the the AI planes can approach not sure if they can hit
mach 2
mach value changes based off altitude
The 26b can get  1100 in level flight at 40k ft, a bit higher at a higher alt
Yea 58 fast af
-20 would be between -12.5 and -27.5 degrees below the horizon
-7.5 is from 0 degrees to 15 below
which is teh default
97% of the time you can leave it at the default
"behind a mountain, and I have my radar above it" is vauge
you really should stick with kts, its the international standard and also what 99% of people in game use so it makes communication easier
We'd have to have a video lol, this isn't really something we'll know whats wrong by just text
Do this just backwards
If will detect missiles who booster has ran out, just at a shorter range
Iv never seen a missile fail to detect unless it was in the blindspot
By "how to use" do you mean how to fire, or are you wondering why they won't hit?
Depends wieldy on altitude/speed
Use the DLZ on the HUD
I doubt that, are you reading the DLZ correctly?
nan
Can shoot when it hits the open top ^
Thats "rMax"
The rectangle thing is "rOpt", you don't have to wait for it
Thats fine
you don't have to wait for it to get down there before firing
it just has to be below this top part
im hosting one rn
Im just not in it
Byond visual range
No that includes IR
normally it means all weapons
A regular 120 sometimes needs more than 10, its about speed
Too fast and the missile dosn't have the turnate, to slow and the missile dosn't have the Gs
its got a sweetspot that its at its most deadly
I rarely look at my Gs when I dodge, I just look at the missile and how fast its closing, then maneuver around that
Normally, dive, terrain = notching and the potential to make the missile loose LOS
also diving means thicker atmosphere
don't
BM
Well it just straight up won't work on my server
Better than just disabling it on all servers which I *could* do but would probably lead to loosing my ability to play vtol
yes but IRL we don't have magic perfect RWR that tells you exactly where to aim and missiles with a 98% pK
Intercepting is as well
People won't care lmao
Someone who wants to intercept won't care about using some budget
No one is saying its unintentional
Just because its intended dosn't mean its good
It still directly effects the other person because their perfect shot with good positioning and tactics is countered by point and click and the other person dosn't have to defend at all
exactly the same argument could be made for shooting on the merge
Dosn't "condone" mean "accept and allow", isn't "dont condone" correct here lol
How's it intolerance? We have different preferences
Shooting on the merge is viable IRL :shrug:
IRL, using an LPI radar to detect a target from 100nm away is a viable tactic but I don't want that in vtol either
Saying a tactic is viable IRL is a poor reason that it should be in vtol
Why would I deal with it when I have avenues to prevent it?
by educating people, the same way we do with shooting on the merge we can reduce the number of people doing it
by using custom servers, we can remove it entirely
Exactly
but, for the regular BVR lobbies as well id rather not have it as well, so education comes in there
Education for regular lobbies
if I really felt like it, I could disable nose-on shots on HS
The IRIS-T supposedly have the cability to, however we have no idea how effective/common its used, and its never been used in practice
So, same with shooting on the merge then?
Then baha is forcing his opinion on others lol
as the in game briefing discourages it
Giving my opinion is not "forcing" it on anyone, the only way I "force" it on people is in HS where I disable it
"forcing" it would be using HC to disable it in *all* lobbies
Giving my opinion is a far cry from that
exactly, its no different than if I hosted a custom mission with custom gamerules/loadouts
I like the AIRS-T as a capable IR missile (its especially required/good in high-level BVR) but I hate intercepting
so, I implement custom game rules
Im just giving my opinion, I think its terrible and should be instant grounds for getting banned from a lobby (that was initiall the plan for HS until someone else gave me a better idea), so thats the opinion I give
Its not balanced at all, AIRS-Ts are overall *higher* pK than a 120, and you can carry 6 on 2 pylons
and its a near guarenteed interception without a need to defend, which means you can stay hot
Outer pylons support the 3x racks
luckily we were able to convince baha to limit it for the built in BVR lobbies, so the stock maps only support 1x per pylon (not counting CTF)
But still, ill take an all AIRS-T loadout over a all 120 loadout every day of the week
They're far better than AIM-9s
But yes they are a regular heat seeker
Dodging puts you in a bad/defensive position
intercepting keeps you nose-hot and maintaining altitude/airspeed
a player that knows how to dodge *and* intercepts is worse than one that only intercepts
Well the 92 dosn't exactly travel in a straight line
it does an instant nose dive
> let them drift until they find a heat signature  > only the aim-92
I guess me and you have very different defs for "drift"
drift normally means without control
nan
its controlling to where the flight computer says to go
If we had `Display Management` and `SLAVE` in the 26, yes
We are missing important buttons/hotas
its 100% worth, but its too clunky right now
True? Yes, intended? No
You can view for launches, confirm impacts/dodges, see how the target is maneuvering easier etc
Launches is the big one
nan
it crashed, its a easy fix and it'll be back up tonight
The technical reason is the log file got larger than 65k char and then the buffer overflowed
Yea sry
big
"bulldog"?
Do you mean "maddog"?
Yeah im more worried that you think maddogs are good
they are objectively terrible and there is nearly never a reason to use them
99% of the time its just a waste of a missile
No
"turn faster" and "not loose a ton of speed" are directly opposed
Your best sustained turn speed is around 270 knots
Harder you turn, the more speed you loose
Don't think it helps your turn rate
just your max-gs
Instantaneous turn rate vs sustained
Sustained is normally what people care about
For what?
LOAL is always enabled
trig uncage is an option that makes LOAL much easier
It switches between LOAL and LOBL depending if you have LOS to the target automatically
Like, in the game? Yes
The 145 itself dosn't have datalink
Step one: Don't get into that situation
chaff will do nothing
you can use terrain if you are low to the ground
Uh.. chaff just dosn't work unless your almost perfectly beaming
Quickly yell at the host (or you yourself if you are) to ban them, once they leave the lobby the missile will despawn
notching and beaming are very similar
But notching requires terrain behind you
No chaff has nothing to do with terrain
but when your in a beam, the radar dosn't know if the chaff is you or if you are you because there's no closure rate, so no doppler shift
chaff dosn't move, so if you aren't in a beam it can use doppler filtering to ignore the chaff
Do you know what red/blue shift is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4OnBYrbCjY
This explains the doppler effect ^
no
Well I mean technically
notching dosn't involve chaff at all
so 1 is infinitely more than 0
Requires zero chaff
chaff and notching are two completely different things
they work in differeny ways
they have different effects
No
Not if you are trying to *notch*
Separate chaff and notching in your mind, they are different things that you often do together, but they work fundamentally differently
that means you are using *chaff*
you aren't *notching*
it does work but its *harder*
No
Notching on its own can break a lock, but due to the 8x STT buff its harder than if they arent locked
you're attempting to notch, while using chaff
its both
you are notching
you are also using chaff
different things with different effects
chaff has *nothing* to do with notching
there are MWS blindspots yes
The RWR will always show fox-3 missiles, however it will never show fox-2s the MWS will try to detect fox-2s, but it has blindspots
that would be a fox-2 in a blindspot
radar will be on the RWR yes
Viewing how the missile travels/how it turns
how far it was launched by
how long the smoke burns for
Here's an example of a missile in my blindspot
no it won't be maddog, you'd still get the M scanning warning
its a switch on the left, on the flight assist panel
its quite stealthy, and because your so slow you are almost always "notching"
Not shape
Only size
No as chaff works better the faster you are going
Notching works better the slower you are
But, don't fight enemy fighters
A well designed mission won't ever put 94s against fighters
Its a loss condition if you are fighting them
You are always meant to either complete the mission before they take off, or kill them on the ground
midnight assassins, urban lib, the airbase strike one, the other small one thats not artic that I can't remember the name of
they have IR missiles
But for every one of those missions, you don't/shouldnt need to fight them
They were bugged so they wouldn't use them
but, its been fixed
No, you must rely on other sensors
Well, there is more to it, but those are good steps to it
"anything" might not be for players,  it might only be for weapons im not sure, anyways you always have the same brightness on EOTS even with your engines off
The big effect is the mach cone/effects, those are very visible on EOTS
CBUs are special
all metric
"Only" 4 minutes at mach 1
there is this file with all the DLZ data
might be useful for making some graphs
nan
Also HC could probably make some good graphs
HC would be actual
One of the origional plans for HC months ago (when baha didn't think I could do it :itsfreerealestate: ) was to create heightmaps of player travel/death over maps
The opposite of HS
You don't want to gain height by hoving directly up, you gain altitude quicker if you have forward velocity
As for forward airspeed, being a bit lighter helps, coordinated flight helps
your normal max airspeed is between 200 and 210 knots

Double won't *really* help most of the time
I personally use single
When parts break is about part weight and time
You can pull 18gs for 1/2 second and be fine
You can pull 14 for 5 seconds and be fine
All about time
Ofc depending on what weapons you have
Most things in VTOL are more complex than they initially seem
VTOL is exceptionally good at making complex systems seem simple
There's a knob on the left hand panel, twist it to your desired option, then press the B button while holding teh knob
AI missiles suck balls lmao
Beyond visual range, aka far as fuck away
BVR just means A2A combat
can be PVP or PVE
/acronym
/acronym
/acronym
.
I already specified that
as a reply to the question
yes
CCRP AUTO with a 25 area and single release is the most precise
sure and if I take random words out of your sentence I can make a false claim as well
take things out of context -> get incorrect statments
:shrug:
are you have brain damage
"Is it PVE" "No just A2A, PVP or PVE"
Sure sure if you want to read it that way
I swear you and ierdna both
I assumed ppl had short term memory so I didn't have to repeat the statement I just made but I guess not :risitas:
you want an 8 AoA
AoA = angle of attack
there's an indicator on the HUD underneath your mach/g values
there's no set speed, you should go however fast/slow you need to go to get 8 aoa
180 if your heavy, if your light its around 160, so stay somewhere in that range
Im tellin him the range
For the CAGM yes
for the CBU there's like 40? total submunitions that target units
Only the small PT boats
CAGM is, "SubMissile"
80 damage
most boats have a 90 min damage
but the components on the boat can get hit/destroyed
each each skeet spins around looking for a target, then fires at that
I can confirm it fires 10 submunitions
not sure bout skeets
oh no im blind
yeah 4 skeets
CBUs are such an interesting weapon
bomb deploys a bunch of small bombs, when they get close to the ground they deploy a parachute, then after a bit they deploy a rocket motor to shoot back up into the sky and spin, then they throw a bunch of tiny disks, then those tiny disks spinning search for a target, then they fire a molten jet at the target
Issue is you can't sink the boats with CAGMs
ye
But you can kill the systems
They can't sink large boats
no
well
yes
but there's a minimum amount of damage that must be done for it to count
it dosn't do the min damage
thats what I mean by can't sink
only think that uses subtractive is the allied carrier iirc so as long as you aren't firing that you're fine
submunitions won't target air
so "can" implies you got exceptionally unlucky and happened to fly in front of a munition
for the CAGM? They are just regular missiles
which is why they are on the sheet
ah
The skeets fire bullets
thats how its implemented, so hypthetically you could get under that
To be fair you can probably do this with a mav
Maybe
you can with a 145 not sure if it works with mavs without the LOAL
wdym?
its got a limited gimble range
generally no, if you know roughly where the target is its generally just easier to find the target
CBU requires dumb-bombing from a bit of altitude
can't use it too low, and can't use it stand off
and its effective area is pretty limited
its 60 degree FOV iirc, so you have to remain in that
if I remember correctly
Baha's vaugly mentioned he wanted to add something equivalent for the TSD, but no there's nothing right now
Wrong channel :Think:
Could do a little trolling and make your wings rip off when you pull 12Gs
I understand the opposite in fact
G-pulling IRL is probably better than we see in vtol
the issue is you don't know exactly where the missile is
inaccurate sensors/systems
But in VTOL we have magic perfect RWR
G-pulling, that is manuvering to dodge a missile *is* better
but the RWR is *worse*
Its more *viable* in vtol because we know where the missile is
Ffs do you come here just to argue :Think:
Sure its better in vtol, the point is its not because we can pull more Gs or because missiles are less maneuverable, its in fact the opposite, vtol missiles are comparably maneuverable. But because we know exactly *where* the missile is we can generally do it more effectively. However its probably likely aircraft like the F-35 can do it extremely well
I doubt an AWACS can spot missiles
But DAS can
Which one?
all terms are made up
G-pulling refers to using a last-second high-g maneuver to avoid a missile
well thats just a description of someone who uses g-pulling
G-pulling refers to using a last-second high-g maneuver to avoid a missile
Yeah I havnt heard that either
pulling lots of Gs, aka turning hard
there is
AIM-9+ is a 9x
"different" meaning what? The AIM-9+ is meant to be a 9x, it was only changed for copywrite
its even called a 9x some places internally
So you want a nerf..?
the 120D in game far out ranges IRL 120Ds
What, IRL?
YEah batter is the limiter in very long range shots
the vtol one has nearly 3x that range
there's some quotes from 15E WSOs talking about battery life and they mention its a limiter for the upper level of ranges
86nm shots and what not IRL are very ideal cases, in practice range is going to be limited
40-50nm shots are reasonable in a real lobby for vtol tho
IRL? No chance lmao
altitude *massively* effects the MAR, more-so than vtol due to vtol missile has such high burn time for missiles
A missile gets most of its energy early on
do that at low altitude it'll be crippled for range
Like id expect *maybe* 15-20nm on the deck irl
and that still seems extreme
Before even considering balance, would it be fun?
what fun is there to push the range *even higher*
For the TGP, click in the stick for one second
There's no hotkey but its a persistant setting
go into EQUIP and switch to the head mode
I recommend trig uncage as well
they were prolly talking about TGP
if there is terrain behind you or not
notching only works with ground behind you
Yes
230nm vs 107nm
40k ft and bit over mach
That lets the missile arrive with a 1000+ knots still, you can prolly launch with less speed if you don't care
maddog wouldn't work at that range
I mean in a maddog mode the missile physically wouldn't be able to travel that far
I wonder if it would be good to make flight_school a forum channel
nan
And would help with some of the repeat questions
"How dodge missile", well theres a post for that with all the links/information
Yeah its actually pretty nice, its been in testing for a bit but got mostly fully released yesterday
Yeah
nan
Can sort by active or by when created
Could be good to try to see if its used/viable, from a responder point of view id much rather forum channels
Make this channel read only so we don't loose the ability to search it, put a message at the bottom saying to create a post in the forum
If ppl end up using other channels more often then can always revert
For what? Searching?
And so that its more orginized/easier to answer two people at once but yes
But I don't know what your responding to > Why not have a separate channel for that? "that" meaning what?
Forum is a nicer way to answer people, and I think it would be really useful for people who don't nesisarially want to ask questions but could get use from the questions/answers
I think with both they would just stick to here for asking questions lol
I think just making this readonly with a post to say create a fourm post does that better
nice thx
Entry speed around 0.8mach works well
Id recommend faster for a less-confident player
Especially as the ppl your likely going to be fighting are going to be going so fast the extra speed can be helpful
Yea
I like staying at least *somewhat* close to my oponent so they can't extend too far
sea level
sea level thats like... around 400-500 I think?
for .8
the game has some intersting code related to a fairly accurate simulation of atmospheric density based off altitude and temp, but I don't think its used
There isn't sadly
Kitkat is very annoying for debugging HC, I can't tell if HC is fucking up or if hes just actually doing whats being shown
Headless Client, the 3d live viewer thing im making
Think of it like tacview, for vtol, real time
Its been in dev for a *while* and still has a ways to go but will do lol
Oh interestingly fourm channels get auto-searched when you create them, so if you ask a simular question itll show you that forurm
but it should update as you were typing, so as you typed out "tes" it should have come up
at least did for me
it always default uses external first
which in some cases is a bad thing but thats a edge case
Likely either you had already expended the externals or they were different types of weapons
Or - it could have been a bug, there used to be a bug that it would sometimes use internals first, but its been fixed and I havn't experienced it sense
landing too early or with too shallow of an AoA can also cause it to miss or break
you should land with ~8aoa
Assuming you mean radar-boresight, then any weapon that can be guided/controlled via the radar can be, so AIM-120, AIM-7, AIM-9, AIM-9+ and AIRS-T
"bombing runs" is a bit vauge, GBU-39's tends to be a good bomb especially for hitting multiple targets at once
No bombs can be guided via radar-boresight
The radar
Boresight is just an auto-aqr mode for the radar, so its basically just a QOL feature for locking targets with radar
Are you thinking ARAD?
ARAD is anti-radiation attack display, its used for ARMs, so the AGM-126, AGM-88 or AGM-188
You are talking about the E bracket, its basically an indication of your AoA
You want it so that your velocity vector is aligned to the middle tick
Technically the E bracket only cares about AoA, not glideslope, that's what the ball on the hud (and deck) is for
Yep, iirc it only shows up if your hook is down
np
Good to know
Hook only effects the ball then
In practice, thats practically meaningless as the AIRS-T's benefits are *wayyyyyy* better than a slight chance of a missile going for a missile
There's no in game tutorials, but you don't really need them
everything about hte F-45 should be intuitive
just note that you use the TSD to fire 120s, not the radar, and you don't need radar on to fire
^^
The manual is good if your looking for out-of-game resources
As a pilot, you can use the radar to locate higher prio targets, and build up SA of what is where
Also if the pilot locks something, the gunner can press "SLAVE"
0 = 0% 1 = 50% 2 = 100%
Its just how extended the flaps are
the HUD on the AH-94 will show incoming missiles as small circles if you detect them with your radar in A2A mode
The radial menu is grip+trigger+b
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQI8fbYpl7o
Dive down is generally a good idea
chaff works only when beaming
for IR missiles reduce your throttle when you flare
The 26b has no internal pylons
Weapon position does not matter for RCS (exception ofc for internal bays, which the 26b has none)
honestly if your gunna go with GBUs, just use guns instead
the tents are all in a row
I wonder
It may get the default RCS
which is very low, but not 0
not really
you can do the technical definition of a cobra in a F-45, but you must be going so slowly that it dosn't make sense at all
Honestly I count that more than the low-speed thing the 45 can do
bcs that lets you do an *actual* cobra
high speed, nose moves quickly, high aoa manuver
at the very least the nose should move quickly
making the oponent fly right by
the cobra still isn't what you want to do there lol
a hard out-of-plane motion is better
in the same way you can do it in a merge to fire a missile backwards :Think:
anything is a possibility
RCS is basically a measure of radar energy reflected back to the receiver
more surface area = more reflected radar more or less
No, because the RCS of the aircraft is very low. Its designed in such a shape that the radar reflects *very little* of the energy back at the target
nan
This sort of shows what im saying, the radar wave itself has to bounce back to be recieved, the F-45 is desinged to mimize surface area that reflects waves back at the radar
Quite a lot
If you mean all internal vs external
Yeah pretty much
Additionally the F-45 uses something called RAM (radar absorbent material) that prevents some of the radar waves from reflecting at all
Given that RCS is pre-baked we don't actually know if those are modeled
They pretty easily could be
But yeah there's no real way to make missile mount hardware stealthy, *especially* as you then have interactions/bounces between the aircraft body and the missile body
its capable of hitting and intercepting
however the 120 itself will never switch to its internal radar, it must get guidence the whole time
88s are less versatile and can carry fewer, if your target is a single sam then yeah I agree
126s are pretty short range
88s are very long range
AGM-161?
The AGM-161 (vtol missile) is very akin to a JSOW
Tho I guess its more like a jassm
whats the difference?
MAD-4 radar has 70 HP with a min-damage of 3
MAD-4 launcher is the same
Iv seen HARMs struggle in the past due to targeting the upperward extended radar dish
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/319915885575798785/992634663984169010/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/319915885575798785/992634664323928184/unknown.png
HARMs are also the only missile in the game that will do full 360s for their targets
iv seen this in game on TSDs as well lmao
top-down attack profile makes it harder to intercept
that wasn't even 180deg let alone 360
Yep
Its the best dogfighter
But by the same vain of logic, why ever fly an AH-94 when you can just level a city with an F-45?
The fun in flying an aircraft is not just how good it is
*Exactly*
AV-42c only missions
Exactly! Its fun to fly
thats my point
just because its *worse* dosn't explain why "youd never pick it"
I mean I don't disagree, I prefer flying the 94 as well, but the 42c is fun and ill play it from time to time
To be fair, I think what baha said was ***farrrrrr*** off "considering"
but it wouldn't be a trainer if it didn't have weapons
IRL trainers don't have weapons bcs they don't want to kill each other lmao
they simulate it for trainer
for VTOL VR, a game, a trainer where you can't actually use the weapons is pretty terrible
Its not a trainer once they put weapons on it
its an airframe theyve converted to be used in combat
The F-45's RWR automatically marks any SAM that pings it
for the other aircraft, they must point their TGP at the SAM in order to mark it
The targeting pod
lets you see/select things up to 25nm away
also has two built in lasers
one for guiding weapons, one for marking/pointing things out to people with NVGs
you have a bearing, elevation, and range, what more do you need?
What data is sent to the AIM-120?
No IRL this works as well
The AIM-120 just gets sent the target position and velocity, the 120 dosn't care *what* that data is gained via
the radar dosn't send any data
the radar is just the sensor that gets that data
Yeah all the missiles commands get sent to it via datalink
data is data
dosn't matter what *produces* that data
the F-45 only has AIM-120Ds
No because AIM-7s don't get data from a datalink, they get it from radar reflections, so it requires the radar
IRL AIM-120s can be fired the same way they are fired in game
No, the 120D's use *anything* that produces a track file
You can basically think of it like the F-45 uses the TSD
so anything that can update the TSD will be capable of guiding an 120d
or rwr or das
Datalink is *not* simple
yes
Range, bearing, and elevation, simple math, now you have a track file
Its command-guided midcourse with active radar terminal phase
In practice IRL inaccuracies + update delays/times means it needs to use its internal radar anyways
For the sake of vtol, while it *could* hit without using its radar at all, that would be extremely unfun, so it'll enable it when it gets close
?
No fox-1s don't use datalink
think of it like a flashlight eyeball analogy
the host aircraft is the flash light, illuminating the target
the AIM-7 has an eyeball on it, that looks for the object thats being lit up
there's no aircraft -> missile communication
So as long as you are pointing your light at the target, it'll guide
No thats command-guidence/and how FOX-3 type missiles work
FOX-1 is just looking for reflected radar energy
no datalink
FOX-1 is a very old type of missile
But you don't point your radar at the ground
you point it at the aircraft
When guiding an AIM-7 you need to keep an STT on the target so the radar beam is pointed directly at it
there can be scatter off the ground ofc if the target is low, and then things get complex, so yes there is a chance it could be fooled by that
thats sort of by definition what ground clutter is
Iirc the radar emits a specific form of wave that helps counteract it
ofc
The first versions of the AIM-7 were beam riding, im not 100% sure what newer versions use, possibly constant bearing?
> distance is given by the radar waves themselves How tho? Normally distance is solved by timing a pulse->return, the AIM-7 has no idea when the pulse was sent
I don't think an AIM-7 has any mechanism to know range
nan
Source for ref https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/navy/ntsp/Aim-7p.pdf
11
Yeah lol
Ooooo interesting
it sorta does
it has two antennas in it
One in the back to see the raw radar
one in the front to see the return
> Missile-to-target closing speed is derived by a comparison of the signals (doppler shift) received by the front antenna and the rear reference antenna.
This must be for older beam-riding versions? Otherwise it wouldn't be in the radar beam so the back antenna wouldnt work I would think
Not 100% sure how it works for more modern aim7s tho
cuz that only works if the missile is within the radar beam
aka beam riding
yeah proportional nav is what it can do without ranging, its the same thign AIM-9s use
thats what I said!
SAS = stability assist system ( @Shadowtail +1) Basically its a assistant that helps control the helicopter/make it more stable, however the higher the value the less overall manuverability you'll have
Yep I move it to off or close to off depending on the phase of combat, no problem!
No I agree
A trainer would be great
Thats what I was saying the whole time lmao
:Think:
In our argument I was aruging *for* a trainer the whole time
No baha said a dedicated trainer could have use
To be clear, a "two seater 26b" *isn't* a trainer
When I say "trainer" I mean a dedicated, specific airframe built for instruction/teaching
Tutorials don't teach carrier landings,  BFM, BVR, tactics, or anything else lol
A trainer dosn't exist to teach how to turn on the plane, it exists to teach all those other things
If baha added a trainer id probably run a weekly training hour
:Think:
whomstedve
Hold the trigger, then press teh weapon switch button
the reason is you have "trig uncage" on
holding the trigger "uncages" the seeker and lets it lock on
Was your nose roughly pointed in the correct direction?
lmao
for a bit
it dosn't quite have enough negative collective to sustain
if you have ARAD HUD on (you should) then you can look behind you and identify which is locking you
the one locking you will be the one constantly updating, rather than updating every few seconds
https://nohello.net/en/
issue with wiggle yaw is your heading dosn't matter, your velocity matters
and yaw dosn't change velocity all that much
Yeah, if you were on *its* 3/9 you would be outside of its radar cone
which, is a good thing, but not beaming
Its not insignificant
actually its pretty large
Up to a 50% increase in detection range if the radar is looking straight up
But thats a maximum
in practice, especially given the ranges the angle isn't too extreme
Compared to if you are in-plane/below it
Depends on whats in the city, there's different radars/missiles/threats, some are more dangerous than others. Additionally if you have wingmen sometimes the city will target them rather than you
If you end up as the targeted one then it can feel worlds different than when your buddy is targeted
Sometimes on dynm lib im able to beeline over the city to the airbase without a single spike lol
be landed
Altitude is not safety from most radar
You can fly above SAAWs and AAA, other than that, theres no "safe altitude"
SAMs do better the higher the altitude, so its actually worse to be high
If you are fighting AI, they will always lock you to fire
If your fighting players they'll lock you at least for a short moment before they fire, unless they are in an F-45
I don't know what you mean
Well head-on is your stealthiest configuration
Actually thats not true, 90 degrees is your stealthiest, but if you want to get close then head-on is best
But yeah you need to turn away when you fire to crank/bleed the enemies missile energy
Why do you cut throttle?
You shouldn't cut throttle unless you have an IR missile fired at you
if an IR is fired, cut throttle, drop some flares, keep throttle down until you visually or auditorily confirm the missile is going after flares
No there is IRAPCs and MANPADS
and the enemy carrier
and less accidental notch
Your MWS will alert you most of the time
unless its in your blindspot
No they are ground
Damn shadow with the WPM
Or the 94's ground radar
The same as the 26b :Think:
the RWR has both the RWR and the MWS displays
And knowing whats locking/pinging you is important
https://quizlet.com/_bqm94n?x=1jqt&i=358vjz
Its a SARH those are trivial to avoid
yeah its when it dosn't turn red that its scary
IRL your life is on the line
:risitas:
they are in the heli
tho not as bad as `A` when in the heli
Missiles are slow, bullet is fast
AIM-9, burns off the rail
120s yes, they drop down then fire
but for 9s they deploy a rail out the side, then the missile fires off the rail
the launch rail physically extends away from the aircraft, no different than a regular pylon then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CRF53SNzHA
this shows it ^
Yeah that one is a 120
but, its a sidebay
Two things, the TADS field of regard, and the slip indicator. The big box with a smaller box inside of it shows where the TADSs is pointed/can see. The small dot above with the two lines is your slip indicator. Slip is basically aircraft isn't pointed the direction its going
General tip is to "step on the ball", if the dot is on the left, yaw to the left
A helicopter is actively trying to kill you at all times, the moment it senses you've let go of the controls and are in a vulnerable position, it will try its best to invert
Basically yeah its normal, put in a bit of trim to correct if but also don't let go of the cyclic
do not ever use it
don't
just really dont
No, the AIM-120 radar cannot see other missiles
It must receive guidance until impact
Nah that’s not really a stall
Low lift/high aoa is different than a stall
No, just IRL a flatspin you will be stalling cuz yeah no airflow
But in vtol you flatspin without “stalling” as the wings are still producing lift
^^ actual explanation
:weeee: :stonks:
its like, one degree off
thats within the good effect area
But yeah animation would be pog
As shown in that image, beam is putting the radar to your directly left/right, 3/9, 90 degrees either side
Notching is doing that, with terrain behind you
yis
you can
as you are beaming at the same time
Think of notching as a sub-set of beaming
There's some reasons which mean notching can be a bad thing and prevent chaff from working
but, using chaff while attempting to notch is not a bad thing
does nothing
By “helps” it means AI won’t shoot at the same target as you
So it can be useful
While holding combat collective or left TEDAC, hold trigger and press B
I’m vtol yes
Irl no
Not directly, but if you use the numbered buttons on the MFD you can fire quite quickly
On the left side of the radar MFD, there will be a number for each TWS track
So 1-4
Clicking that button will STT thy track
Even in STT on a target, TWS tracks are maintained
nan
I think this is the cleanest example of a guns jink I have. Quick roll to get out of plane, then hard pull
generally, dont let people get behind you
Just a GPS point, and to be pointed roughly at it
Nope
For the F-45, you must hold trigger then press B
Holding trigger opens the bay doors, B releases the bomb

> the user should lead the targets' future position so that the target will be within the missile's detection field of view once it enters its terminal phase @Freedomplaza Tbh, generally its best to just put the point directly on the boat unless you are super far out. Assuming the missile sees the boat within its radar, it does some math to try to work out *which* boat you fired at based off movement speed, so best accuracy is without lead
I only use terminal
this advice works, but its not really meant for combat/rapid landings
For what, engine thrust?
nan
Thats the curve for atmospheric pressure vs engine performance
you can easily cruse well above that
just the image, the vertex is at 0,0
straight from unity
nan
there's also this curve for thrust vs speed
Bottom is speed in m/s lmao
Which is prob also why thats the max-speed
Well the heli uses the same curve iirc
so its max speed is also 1100 knots
Yeah
That lines up with what iv seen in game
You can with grip + stick down
there's a few built in gestures
that means you have trig uncage on, you must press the B button to fire
The voice that speaks to you is commonly called “Betty” yes, named after the woman that recorded the voice lines for the F-18’s voice
Oh I didn't know that lol
Its fine to ask questions, the moment you answer it you are breaking the rules
Lota messages to go look through
Anything that dosn't end with a question mark, delet
Eh
Kestral is best dogfighter
so I use it
Nah bcs viff
vif = vectoring in flight, basically rotating the engine mid-dogfight to change your circle
yeah so its good at dogfighting as well
but the 42 gets AB with rotated engine so its better
You must fly a very specific way for chaff to work
Yeah high-g pulls are a bit op
The pilot of the 94 is the one technically “firing” the missile according to the game
It do take a lot of practice
And increases RSI chance
Fox-1s guide on the radar return energy, so it can’t guide via pings
It also wouldn’t know what target to go for
Irl they even have to configure their radars to different freqs to prevent interference
G-pulling is good but less consistent than other methods imo
But could use a nerf as it’s an “easy” tactic for how good it is
Still worlds better than it used to be before G damage lmao
Iirc it’s modeled, it’s a force applied on the body so it’s effected by mass
Try it and find out, mods break from time to time but won't know until someone tries
yes
Don't think so
1 to 4 back to front
its the arrestor cables
nan
There can be a bunch of reasons why you don’t get the “host has quit” messages, primarily because the host closed the game without closing the lobby, so the game isn’t able to send out the quit message before it’s closed
Generally any decent flight-sim pedals will work
I dunno if iv ever checked tanker speed lol, just fly next to it then you know the speed
Only reason iv checked is when other ppl ask
"one in half out"
Basically, when you move the throttle, almost immediately move back 1/2 whatever you just did
Yep
and if you go 10% up you go back 5% down
Throttle control is very dynamic
you are constantly moving it up/down
@Mug pay attention to the throttle on the HUD, I am moving it all over
well I started at 0 :risitas:
Basically just practice/eyeball
There's no "oh im going backwards, need to increase the throttle"
its just, fly the plane
:risitas: I give the best advice I know
Radar scans all the ships, looks at how fast they are going, compares against how long ago it was fired, checks where the boats *were* when it was fired, checks which is closest to its GPS point
Yep
Unless you fire from *really* far away
its best to put directly on the boat
Nooo there’s no magic here
So if the boats change direction or speed it’ll throw off the missiles calc
But in the case they do that, it falls back to just finding the closest boat to the gps point currently
Only once it has them on its own radar
Nah, at super high range you may need to lead yourself, but generally with the radar fov, boat move speed, and missile time of flight means it’s not needed
If I am doing primarially a2a but know there's some SAMs ill use 126s, a "ah fuck my team dosn't know how to SEAD and now im next to a sam" weapon
> -keep the trigger on the combat collective pulled just like the grip, this way your muscle memory for chaff and flare will not mess up your SOI settings This still makes me so angry
because its nessecary
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAPaeSS4k9rfrRZbla7MmM311q8psB0YJYV-KVB1SzA/edit
it *should* work for all controllers
Near the end I said `Throttle Thumbstick In` could be used for an alternative MODE switch button for controllers missing the button
never
> hitting ground targets seems like the right times to me Ehhhhhh not normally, that'll make the aircraft behave a bit strangely depending on airspeed
More manuverable for like, a dogfight
lift = maneuverability
Flaps traditionally are just used for takeoff/landings as they let you fly slower (as they increase lift)
but "increase lift" has the additional bonus of increasing manuverability
it can be useful in a dogfight
you can use it to cut your turn circle, it *can* be used for ground, but really only when you are gunning things
Gunning meaning to use the gun, so yeah not bombs and missiles
correct
/acroynm pls
discord supports 25 options iirc
Could also just do a non-autocomplete version, which would allow unlimited
That would be good too, but iv had to define acronyms so much id like a specific command for it
~~that guy that asked in 4 different discord servers and 6 channels how to disable the mod loader in under a minute~~
Terminology isn't meta
A Fox-3 is a fox-3 no matter how good at the game you are
my pilots.cfg is interesting
pog
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rh2ZlxwtfRvLU1q3uzpQEoHefu8r5HnEGBO4AsEHv0Y/edit
That won’t but this might
?
It dosnt indicate that you need to hide “in” your chaff
It also dosnt indicate you need to have time traveling chaff
So mine is correct?
You want chaff to exist before hitting 90
As there *is* a gradient
So chaffing a bit before is best
I mean sure but that’s not what Sypwn said
Smol did, but the one I posted was voted to be better hence why it’s pinned
+ time traveling chaff + hiding inside a chaff cloud
“The ones that can vote did and determined that to be better”?
Sounds valid to me
Who cares if the voting populus at the time was 1
Ok re-vote: 2-1 the current one stays
Done
My and Shadow vote for it to stay, Sypwn votes to remove
No there however is a detriment
In a similar vain to flares, it’s best for “bursts” as you want to “lead” the radar away from the aircraft
New chaff has a higher effectiveness, which could make the radar look more at you, which prevents the lock from slipping off
So mine shows a more effective chaff employment
Nah before is objectively better
You’d want to deploy exactly when the effectiveness curve starts sloping in, so a bit before 90
And being physically farther from the chaff is good, so early is good
Yes that’s why wiggle works
Ehh it’s more complex than that
But it’s late and I’m on mobile so I can’t be bothered to write it out
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/622107701614477333/1020670639587213482/chaff.png
Chaff effectiveness curve ^
There's no relation to disatance on that graph
Its just "effectiveness" per bearing
where 0 is the most effective
Basically it shows that if the radar is directly in front of you, its 0% effective
if its directly to your 3 o'clock, then its 100% effective
yes
If your hitting a weak target with large bombs there's no need to be precise, so increasing the margin of error allows the jet to drop the bomb even when you fly a less-perfect path
In practice, imo there's next to no reason to increase it
If someone wants to write the code to parse vtgr files I’m happy to give them an alpha key
It’s the file format HC uses for replays/recordings
I haven’t written documentation for it
But
If anyone wants to parse it I will
It’s a p simple format
Ight I’ll write docs tomorrow
I don’t see why not
But it’s up to them to decide how to parse it
Python would be a good choice, but tben they’d have to also implement my compression/decompression logic rather than reusing mine that’s written in ts
Tho that too is pretty simple
Looking at their google sheet, mostly turn rates for different altitudes/airspeeds/fuel states
Copilot wrote much of the compression code so it should be already nicely familiar
I’m going to do the only reasonable thing and write code to automatically create docs from the HC code base, which will of course take 10x longer than just writing the docs
Primarily I just want to document the RPCs
So basically just function signature + class name + RPC type
Generally you always land later than you expect on a carrier
You want to land *on* the wires not before them
So basically yes your advice is good
You use the TSD not the radar
Just click target on the TSD, and fire
Do you know how to use the F/A-26bs radar?
Yep
Its used the same way to the 26bs radar, except you only need to click once rather than twice
Just SOI, move the pip over the target, click so it has a circle around it, and fire
np
@Bitzs @Shirt @CEILINGSPY Moving discussion about HC/replays to my server, iv created some documentation and provided some resources in #deleted-channel https://discord.gg/vrNSM9Vqa2
In mp everything is effected by connection, so yes, but unless you have particularly bad connection it shouldn't be an issue. AI missiles are shit so that makes them easier to dodge
after
Best to chaff as you enter the 90 degree but yes
Its possible
But, as long as you have a *stable* connection it should be fine, maybe try "exadurating" your motions as you try to chaff
Yeah
F-16 the mod?
You gotta change direction
Yes press "HEAD" on the radar page
Or for IR missiles there's an option under equip
Anytime you die, ask yourself *why*
if only :sad_cat:
Yeah good luck with that :risitas:
thats just high aoa flight
In the same way the sky is "technically" blue
150 is slow in my experience
unless you are particularly light
to go for an 8 AoA, you'll be closer to 160 170 depending on weight and flaps
nan
it means at some point in time you have been pinged by its radar
applies to ground units as well
does not fade/reset over time, only after respawn
Nope its not synced over DL, its specifically *you have been pinged*
In a guns only BFM lobby don't shoot on the merge
Don't use hot mic
Don't intercept missiles with AIRS-Ts
Bad etiquette
Shooting on the merge thing is also for pvp, feel free to bully the AI :risitas:  ^^
Its the B button on the stick
When you first fly past each other
Remember that AIM-120s are not guaranteed to lock the target you fired at, so don't use them when a teammate is super close to your target
I don't say anything a vast majority of the time, its not important
sometimes people complain that you don't call your shots as it lights up the MWS, but its really on them for poor SA about where friendlies are and what not
If you do want to learn the callouts/termonology, this is a good resource https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rh2ZlxwtfRvLU1q3uzpQEoHefu8r5HnEGBO4AsEHv0Y/edit
Don’t fly *directly* at them, push a bit of negative Gs and yaw some
They cannot be given a new location/point, but they will correctly guide onto the point that was placed
You want an 8aoa
There's three indicators in the aircraft, the indexor, the E bracket next to the velocity vector, and the AOA readout below the mach
It has the alpha symbol next to it
nan
Bad photo
but
its the number on the bottom there
aoa 100% changes the waveoff logic, if you come in too far off it'll yell at you and give you a waveoff for an aoa
me
Would be nice if the ILS was in the HUD as well, its too far down for me
this is the thing I find most useful at a glance for AoA
you want your velocity vector to align with that middle tick, then you have an 8aoa
What your telling me you don't need it in ***4 different locations***
Hard to place it on a scale, some parts are more realistic than others
Readout on the HUD E bracket AOA indexer Data page
Here's a landing I did if it helps for ref
To be fair at like 0:20 that was because I was way off the alignment, so I had to continue straight then turn in
A big issue is thinking of it like a landing where your touching down on the front of the carrier, instread think of it like flying your aircraft "onto" the wires, fairly far back
you want to touch your main landing gear onto the wires, so you land farther back (forward? To the front of the ship) than you expect
Its an F15/16/18/22 combo
its got bits of all
the cockpit
dual MFDs with the location of the RWR/fuel page are all very akin to an F-16
Many do
nan
Only the very recent F-16s replace the 6pack with another screen
The fuel selector?
Or do you mean the top
the UFC?
ye
Ye thats the primary way to interface/entre data into the aircraft
We have no need for that in vtol, so we don't have that panel. Instead we get simplified AP options
Yee
Ye its uncaged, and the option is only there when you have trig-uncaged turned off
Depends if you meant "trig uncaged" or "uncaged", Sypwn described "trig uncaged", "uncaged" is a mode for the advanced IR missiles, it means the seeker will lock onto whatever it sees and follow it, and it means if you have a radar lock it will slave the IR seeker to that
You don't use it to turn, it can sometimes be useful for lineing up a shot or specific manuvers when at low-speed
Using rudder for lineup when landing is bad, you'll rarely change your heading much
Bruiser is anti-ship cruise missile
greyhound is the land/gps
"vampire" is "incoming anti-ship cruise missile"
this
Im working in the context of vtol here, the AGM-161 is the only land GPS based missile we have
Radars (in most cases) can't *gain* a lock on you while your on the ground,  however if you are locked, they can *hold* the lock even after you land
In many cases when you land you are going so slowly that you end up notching and breaking the lock, but not always
Differences in your aircraft loadout, distance to radar, and radar type all will change if it succedes or not
Yes, just requires lots of distance/time
nan
Here's me doing it awhile ago, with the limitation that I had to stay somewhat close to the radar until the missile got close ^
no don't intercept
don't get into that situation in the first place
notch/chaff
dive it into the ground
boat radars are elevated
missiles themselves are often above you
Just gotta put it on your 3/9 line
and make sure to change direction up/down to get out of the missiles path
Iv found more success in pitching out
situational ofc
for notching yes, chaffing is a tiny bit more involved
right after the update probably isn't a great example of whats good/bad :risitas:
I generally agree that "notching" is less useful, its got its placed but its mostly for avoiding a missile before it locks
Chaff however is exceptionally useful
This demonstrates how good chaff is pretty well
Launch in TWS when pls I beg
No
I leave yaw assist on, with it off its very easy to over-rotate/end up pointed a direction you don't want to be
I have a *decent* amount of practice and I still don't think its worth it, and iv never met someone who routinely kept it off (and also did good)
turning it off in specific situations is *maybe* useful, but only if you can quickly and reliably reach the switch without looking
Nop
COM is unchanged by fuel/loadout
weapons don't apply aerodynamic drag
larger on the top
not a huge margin
maybe 5%?
No like jaiden said it’s applied in all directions equally
I have
No idea where it is rn
Nop just lots of time reading the decompiled code + my dad being a pilot = easy access to info
He did awhile ago
He though it was really impressive and felt quite good
It is, that visualization is just what the process to pre-bake looks like, thats not actually happening on the fly in game
Its just 18 view vectors + the strength for that vector, so practically no storage required
Only on the top/bottom
Heli dosn't have RAM
only the 45
Yeah
No one got pinged
You don't have @ everyone perms
single
Its not "overcomplicated" its just detailed mixed with lore
You have to use the screen, can't do it from HOTAS
its one of the things I suggested as an improvement
"not yet" implies its going to happen :risitas:
Yeah
Throttle thumbstick left/right
as long as you have thumbstick rudder disabled
Yep
I can't convince him if he dosn't respond :Crycat:

Nah just those two
Nop works really well a2a as well
but you very much should
Good, don't do it again
Yes
It does 80 damage

6 = 2 | 4 = Ground or Ground Armor
Which makes it seems like it dosn't target boat sub-systems...?
Same,  ground or ground armor
nan
Above the min altitude, beyond that dosn't matter
To be fair it also weighs a lot more
but yeah
Hey if the game disables my RWR ima g-pull
Combat collective trigger+B
I don't blame baha for that one
I blame anyone with this role
Like this
I think the RWR should be able to detect over mountains to some extent due to the wave reflection
and both are called RCS, or rcs
Ok but that RWR thing is acutally a thing IRL

Awacs isn’t on that graph
Awacs is insanely powerful, so much so that we couldn’t put it on the graph
""optimal"" is hire than you could ever possibly fire, so there's no optimal, its just as high as possible
I mean not counting altitudes that you cant maintain level flight, its still higher = better
as higher you get, faster you can go
You are limited by where you can hold level flight
The higher you go the more speed you need to maintain level flight, you wouldn't be able to maintain at 60k ft mach 0.5
For vtol, the limitation in altitude is in how fast you can go, if you want to climb at all you need more speed
But can you hold level flight there?
that would be worse
if your spawning yourself at 10k+ knots you want the mass to hold onto your speed a bit more
no, that logic holds true for any altitude
There's a max altitude with the editor, not with vts
very
above 80k iirc
not level, but max
Do you have a red light next to the arm switch?
.
ok ok but do you have a red light next to the arm switch
bruh
yes
they will
In MP at least, sometimes SP acts funny
its AI aircraft that have the funny NAV but no TSD
On PVP strike you always see people as they go for the SAMs
No
Wait maybe thats PTT
I can't remember
They keep going
Only time they'll instantly despawn is when you leave the game
Are you *sure*?
Mine has emphasis therfore better
Can you record?
And make sure you have the stat window open
sure
Like the different numbers and letters?
^
It attempts to acquire an STT on the target, when its not locked its still scanning
LOS confirmation is the big one imo
You instantly know when you are LOS to a target, and know the track file is updated/live
Nah if you get the trackfile again itll resume guidance
Yes I’m agreeing with the test
Especially as y’all weren’t clear if it was or not
AIM120 dosnt have a regular dl receiver
Regular 120s receive their guidance commands encoded in the radar wave
So it’s a type of dl, but not the same that a 120D has
No because once your radar has lost the target, that DL connection is severed
I think both reflection, or just regular emission, from what I understand it’s got a secondary antenna in the back
It is, too complex to explain rn
The TLDR is it’s extremely difficult to try to resume guidance, it may be possible in some situations however I’m p sure the 120 can’t run it’s own radar and the DL at the same time, so in practice it’s basically always better for the 120 to just enable its own radar and find the target
Stands for Too Long Didn’t Read, basically “in summery”
I’m using it here to mean “the short explanation”
No its the wire # you got, counting from the back to the front
you are targeting #3
You only can catch 1
No
#3 is the best
In order of good to bad, 3 2 4 1
RCS dosn't change no
Ye
Bay doors have an effect yes
not the gun door however
There's a tutorial somewhere, its a bit of a process
Jaiden is correct, it’s turn rate. Yaw is such a tiny tiny tiny turning force that it’ll not really show there, do a regular roll + pull and then it’ll show
Yaw is ***not*** how you turn your plane
Try flying level, then max yaw, then time how long it takes you to do a 360
It’ll prob be at least 10 minutes
The thing is the only turn force you get is the tiny bit of thrust from your engine pointed to the side
So yaw has practically no change in your velocity
No thats specifically when its bad
They have a 1 second activation delay, and given that they don't lead the target until they see it, in close range its extremely unlikely to hit
MADDOG has extremely niche use case, whenever at all possible you should not use it
but you should still use them
Heavier you are the more flaps you should use, generally I use flaps 1 for land based landings, but its all about weight and how fast you want to come in at
your call
go for it, see how the landing goes
Higher flaps = slower speed
No
the missile isn't designed for it, and it'll get updates extremely infreqently
Only chance it has to hit is if the guy happens to STT the missile itself
Yes
Nope the RWR is a passive sensor, it dose not emit anything
wdym both of your radars?
*Your* radar being off dosn't control if they can see you
They don't have magic detection no
but they do have their own radar
Your radar being off prevents you from being on RWR
But they can use their own radar to find you still
radar guided *bombs*?
Those don't exist, radar guided missiles no, flares are IR counter measures
chaff is for radars
Yeah chaff works, flares is an IR counter measure
Yes
no
yeah lmao
makes takeoffs and landings smoother
parking break is for parking
if you don't intend to park
don't have it on
The disadvantage is it’s noisy and burns a little bit of fuel
But it’s a very minor disadvantage, it dosnt really matter
Yeah
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Radar_Warning_Receiver_(RWR)
Basically yes
there some cases typically in a rolling scissors you'll want to pull back a bit
But in general, no, full throttle
Basically chaff dosn't work when the radar isn't locked onto you, but in order to chaff you need to be in a beam, so sometimes while trying to chaff you instead notch, meaning chaff has no effect
and because notching dosn't degade the track/prediction at all, it often can lead to death
When the radar locks onto chaff the missile is commanded to target the chaff and stops searching for a few seconds, which often defeats the missile, where as with notching the host radar will continue to give the missile updates so it'll get closer and closer
nan
The missile isn't "pitbull" until its locked on the target
Once its locked at least once, yes, it'll no longer get guidence
But it'll guide until the first lock
> missile still get guidance you must talk about the 45 No this is true for the 26b as well
unless you notch the 26b radar, but its much harder to notch a radar that has already locked you, and the 26b radar is far more powerful than an 120's radar
> does it matter during the guidance phase that chaff Chaff is only useable after the missile has locked you
The issue is *notching* prevents that lock
notching keeps it in the guidence phase
We want it to switch over and lock us
Clip I posted above is 26b ^
yeah
np
But does effect notching
By 2x and 8x yes
Notching considers RCS, linearly correlated
RCS prob isn't the correct term here
"Lockability"?
The effect of STT/TWS buff on notching? Yes
I think you can intentionally fly in a way to make it harder to chaff, iv messed around in low tech missions when people are trying to chaff me by cranking the same direction they are going so that it’s harder to align to the 90
No
#faq for explination
Depends on how you define "effective"
every one of those weapons can be employed for DEAD
HARM generally is the *easiest* and safest weapon to use
What does "direct cover" mean?
Well if you have LOS, any works, without LOS you'll need to use an optical LOAL or GPS weapon
Trigger, same as normal. You hold it down while you fly over the target
Yeah
In CCPR Auto that is
**C**onstantly **C**om**p**uted **R**elease?
Whats the issue
TWS and STT both get a signal strength buff, basically have a better time tracking the target
TWS = 2x STT = 8x
So, holding STT can be good
but, scanning lets you find new targets/have SA
Define, "cruising altitude"?
higher = faster, 50k tends to be the seatspot ish
it does
But less so compared to how thin the atmosphere gets
np lol
If its got a radar that makes it easy with ARAD HUD, otherwise not really
MWS itself has no fixed range, depends on the heat of the missile
Its an IR system, so hotter objects are easier to spot
And then it checks if teh missile is actually approaching you/headed at you before it warns so that you aren't constantly getting warnings from your or friendly missile
Launch warning is 20km for the 26b
30km for the 45
So 10nm and 16nm
20km = 10nm, 30km = 16nm
Decently so, heat is dependent on the motor burn time, how fast the missile is moving, and how long the motor has been burned out for
and half the time it dosn't work
the TSD red line is just for radar
its basically to show what is STTing you
not really, its been in for awhile now
but it is buggy
yes
:itsfreerealestate: 8pm
Thats RCS/notching basically
Missile is searching for you, but can't find you
Yeeeep
Notching is actually really good pre-lock
Even the 26b with full weapon loadout can accidently notch missiles
yea
We'll often hold an offset and show belly to allow it to lock us, then go into the perfect perpendicular to chaff
correct
Welcome to anything anywhere ~~online~~, first time?
No its just seal clubbing
They are super easy to kill
but they can kill people that don't know what they are doing
There's a guy that specifically host's lobbies just to fly into orbit and throw 120s at noobs
Indeed
Thats why we were stacked on a team yesterday :risitas:
Almost got you with the ground AIRS-T
I shoulda fired a 120 but I was being dumb with the radar
You can with wingtip 120s
I had folded my wings so they would have the clearence
I also parked at the crest of a ridge in a hope to give them a better chance
Control surfaces only change *rotation* not velocity
In order to have a *turn rate* you need both
So wings effects *turn rate*
Rotation rate is not turn rate
What are you defining of as "turn"?
Rotation?
Because the normal definition of "turn" is not a rotation, its physically changing your direction of flight
The aircraft **rotation** is achieved via control surfaces, but the change in **velocity** is done by the wing (and engines somewhat)
Which is why a normal aircraft turn is done with practically neutral control surfaces
As once you are in a bank, the component of lift is rotated, causing you to turn
thats all done with the wing
nan
White line is the wing
The force it produces is always perpendicular, yellow line
You can break it into two components, in the x and y axis'
The y axis is your lift (red arrow)
The x axis (green arrow) is the result turn force produced
By the wing
This is a Z axis view to the wing
Noo
Imagine you are at the back of the aircraft
looking forward
this is the wing
in a slight left hand bank
"forward" would be "into" the screen basically
No its true for all angles
It is
nan
Same force diagram applies at a 90 degree angle
?
+Y is up, there's no force acting in a +Y axis
Thats.. what it does?
Difference is aoa, aka how much lift the wing is producing
Higher aoa = higher lift
Roll isn't aoa
So how does rolling 90 degrees matter here?
Side on view this time, top arrow is direction of flight. Imagine the red line is the velocity/flight path, in level flight the lift force (green arrow) is equal to the force of gravity (yellow arrow)
If lift increased, the velocity would be "pulled" upwards right?
Thats a turn
Yes
Its for visulization
Velocity isn't a "line" with a point/end
????
Yes it is
what
it dosn't matter where I draw the arrows
Point is, lift and gravity are equal so velocity does not change (no acceleration)
If lift increases, the velocity vector would rise up higher
So... at the center of lift
This isn't pitch that im talking about, this is change in velocity
Getting back to my point
If lift increases, the velocity vector rises up
That much you agree/follow with right?
And, we explained that a change in the direction of velocity *is* a turn
Just keep following my train of logic
Is it fair to say, that a increase in lift caused a turn?
what is a turn then?
But define a turn
Because we seem to disagree on definition
Ye which is why I qualified with direction in my initial statement
But... thats not a turn
and the videos you've posted the aircraft is changing its velocity
So you are saying the change in velocity is required in order to "turn"...?
This is where the fundemental issue is
A turn is not a rotation
A turn is a change in direction of velocity
No
Not a mix
rotation has nothing to do with a turn
Rotation is often required *in order to turn*
A turn is a change in **__direction__** of velocity
slowing down is not a change in direction
No it *is* turning
No
Velocity change *is* turning
Cfster an aircraft pointed 90 degrees up, but still going forward has not "turned", would you agree with that?
So... this is the issue
you are just wrong on that point
Rotation and turning is different
An aircraft that goes from 0 aoa, to 30 aoa, with the same direction of flight has not turned
both aircraft with the same flight path/direction, but different aoa, as you have defined it, slowing down is a turn
What?
Never did I define slowing down as a turn
nan
Change in **direction**
Not **rotation**
And, simply put, in the context of aviation, rotation (yaw/pitch/roll) is not a "turn", its just, not correct. Especially as then what do you call it when a plane "turns around", aka does a 180 degree change of its direction? It can achieve that without rotation, so what would it be called?
All he did was spin around
I wouldn't say "dumbass", just you have some misunderstandings about how aircraft work, and a refusal to use the same terms as everyone else makes it very difficult to discuss anything
Better missile spacing, better IR missile use, and setup the merge better
:shrug: practice
And terrain, don't fight them just out in the open
On a map with flat terrain you have to G-pull basically
I dislike fighting in the open, its just spamming missiles at each other and G-pulling
> You can't g pull a heater
Its Andy
Yea
> he slipped rather than a win At high level, nearly all kills are just because someone else messed up
Don’t
Don’t
5:26 is a lie
nan
:risitas:
It was too fast
Long range shot so it had time to accelerate
Was faster than its optimal turn rate
It must have been, but why was he carrying AIM-9s lmao
Fwiw my dad has pulled 11Gs in an F-15
They don’t break if you only pull a bit over the limit, it’s just dangerous and requires lots of maintenance/checking/repairs so that it’s safe
And in a 26b you'll break if you sustain 14 for too long
RPM lowering by a small amount is normal, if its so extreme you end up coming back down, you either have only one engine running, or your power setting is at idle
Because its just objectively worse than 230 + 145s :risitas:
I find the 230 faster still, at least at range
Close up the GAU is prob faster, but if your any higher range than 1nm the 230 is gunna do way better
Hydra's only is always fun
Also no-TADS is fun, so hydras + head slaved gun
Unit icons off is annoying because mission designers love to shove a manpad in some random ass place then make it a requirement to kill
But yeah other than that its fun
wdym?
its worse in radius, it has tiny wings that don't produce much lift at all, so at very high speeds it can't turn very much at all
G-pulling fast missiles is easier because the missile physically can't turn as well
Like it might be pulling more Gs, but its going so fast that its not physically making much turn
^
corner velocity tends to relate to maximum Gs a missile can pull, not the tightest turn it can do. If a missile is moving mach 4, then even a 30G turn will appear to do basically nothing as its turning for so long
Consider two objects, one moving at 250 knots, one moving at 1000 knots. They both pull 10 Gs, which has a smaller turn circle?
The point is "corner speed" is not "smallest turning circle"
My understanding is corner speed has to do with maximum Gs
nan
No for the point that I mentioned above, for a given G, radius will be smaller for a lower airspeed
So for like a good dogfighter, you want to be able to pull a ton of Gs at low speed for the small circle
With the F-45 internal bays, holding the trigger opens the bay door, then pressing the weapon switch button releases the bomb
the button you press on your controller to switch weapons
np
it is which is annoying
I wish we got a button like alt mode
KIAS is extremely important for a dogfight
No id argue its worse than nothing
In a dogfight having to loose an entire MFD, plus having to look down into my screes to read a single value from a list is not good
Yea I have just rough numbers/feel for different altitudes
Mach number is at least indicated rather than true
Yeah mach is different per altitude for same speed, and is displayed as such
Tho there's an odd inconsistency in that the TSD/RADAR display the sea-level mach value for aircraft
If I want to work purely in mach sure
Knots are nice tho
Guesses and feels off mach, if I had knots I would prob go for an exact number. Mach being a tiny number in the HUD and less precise, I don't bother
IRL aircraft let you change between the two because they are both very important to display large on the HUD
The big one is rate fight speed, as the difference of 10 knots is a ton
I mean sure it *technically* is, but it’s a lot more work mid-dogfight to be looking at the tiny decimal on my HUD then doing the mental math to calculate that in knots
Rather than looking at my hud and instantly being able to go “I’m about 300knots”
I have to instead read 0.45 on the hud and then do the math
Alternatively
The game could just support something every irl aircraft has for a reason
Yea that’s all I’m saying, I do perfectly fine with mach/guess, but the game should def support it
Are you flaps 2?
170 is reasonable
200 is fast
Anything 180 or below should be fine
Are you sure you are snapping the wires rather than just missing them?
Gotchya
Yeah id have to see a video to say, 170 knots is reasonable, be willing to come in a bit steeper (higher AoA) if you are very heavy. Whats your loadout?
Iv landed with a decent amount of fuel fine, id have to see the specific situation/load/approach to say more/whats going wrong
np
Thats not the problem, the problem is he comes in at a good glideslope and aoa, but the wire breaks because for that glideslope/aoa he's fast
Placebo maybe? They functionally should be equally as easy to chaff
F-45 missiles can often be quicker because you weren't cranking to begin with, so you have less time to get to the beam
I think chaffing in the F-45 ends up being easier due to the G-limiter, iv been tempted to try turning on the limiter in the 26b and chaffing like that
As you can full back on the stick and get a nice smooth 9-10g pull, which is better for chaffing, without having to worry about over-g
Ah :risitas:
Iv been pinged twice but there's too many messages here, what were the questions?
Search cone should be where the radar *thinks* the aircraft is yeah
Normally 9g's is to get into the initial 90, then from there back and forth, my point was more so that you didn't need to worry about how hard you yanked the stick, especially for very close missiles that you are trying to chaff, things where a quarter second really matters
for a "normal"/easy chaff with a single missile you can setup well for, yeah, 9g is over-kill
Look through pins in this channel, especially this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQI8fbYpl7o
Which part?
If you have *specific confusions* I can help, if its just "all of it" then not really much I can do
Notching is putting the radar on your 3/9 line so that it confuses you with the terrain behind you
Im not at my VR rn
Its "justifiable", as in there's a logical explanation, but most helicopters can be tracked because of their rotor yea
But the rotor has a p small cross-section, so heli's still can be annoying to track irl
Yeah ram + small cross section
It just dosnt work. What “capitalize on lack of energy” exists? You have to get enough separation so you can turn around safely, and during that time the other guy has plenty of time to accelerate. Then you are just coming into another merge again
That just looks like a second merge, its a headon
and if its an even second merge, no one has advantage, its like the first merge didn't happen
We can """stall""" as in there's an alpha the wings don't produce lift at, however it seems some combination of lack of control surface washout/very high thrust and lift, our "stalls" really aren't "stalls", they are more of an aoa limit
There's some good explanation here https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/55163/why-does-a-stall-decrease-lift-rather-than-increasing-it
Ultimately yes there is *a* component of force still producing lift, however its farrrrr lower than it was a moment ago, with the issue of massively increased drag
Im sure there's a valid math explination of it somewhere
but too advanced for me
Its one of those things that I just accept as "how planes work"
Baha needs to release a new aircraft already, I learned a *tooooooooon* about helicopters leading up to the ah94 release, he needs release something new again so I can once again spend all my time learning about it :risitas:
Bcs DCS costs lots of monies and is far less interesting
Ill learn the F-15E once it comes out
I have more precision with VR controls
Maybe thats because I have a bad HOTAS, but for the price, VR controls give me excellent precision
Oooo I don't think you sent me that one
It’s a big argument in aerodynamics
https://youtu.be/QKCK4lJLQHU
:sus:
Well
Am at a family gathering
So skill issue
put EOTS or TADS onto target, if you have trig uncage enabled, hold down the trigger, then press teh weapon switch button
Well you can use it like the maverick in game, but yeah optical weapons in vtol are always slaved via the TGP on that aircraft
Still with the EOTS, you'll want to point the eots "behind" a mountain at the target. basically the EOTS tells the weapon a position on the ground to search for a target at
So use the TSD to find a target, press the "EOTS" button to slave the EOTS. Hold trigger to uncage the seeker, and you'll see a new "LOAL" icon apear, thats where the missile will fly. Point that over the mountain, and fire
View is weird
You can "view" at like 30 if not farther
but then there's a range like 29-26 that they fade out/go invisible
and then they come back in at 25
Depends on missile heat
id have to calculate it
but im quite against math
I just don't understand what an "optical guided AIM-120" is, its just a made up optical a2a weapon? Sounds like something for a mod. If its got an optical sensor on the front, its not an AIM-120. And optical weapons generally are pretty shit A2G, let alone A2A. There's a reason why a maverick is an obsolete/old weapon
Is that not how it currently works?
:Think:
AIM-120Ds are guided off track files
Dosn't matter what creates that track file
EOTS creates a track file
so if you point your EOTS at a plane, you can guide a 120 at it
Yeah I was exctremely confused lmao
I thought they meant like put a Maverick seeker on the front of a 120
As in, no pitbull?
Well until the 120 pitbulls at 13km
Because the EOTS dosn't set off the RWR
I find it very unlikely any 120 can do full non-pitbull
but yeah D's can use late pitublls iirc
no do not
bad
An actor id, last detected time, last detected position, last detected velocity, and a state
There's some russian missiles that use DL mid-course and IR terminal iirc
I only said optical dosn't exist
IR does iirc
MICA-IR is a French DL mid-course + IR-terminal missile
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MICA_(missile)
A DL-mid course IR-terminal missile would be interesting, not *too* hard to counter but could defo catch you off guard
In vvr *anything* is possible
vtol vr
But yes, because its 100% accurate it dosn't require pitbull, shoot at an F-45 thats notching or a 45 thats nose-on and it'll only pitbull a fraction of a second before impact
well it'll enable its radar, I meant find the lock
no you can defo chaff it
no
not in vtol
cuz chaffing works off making the radar lock cone get away from your aircraft
so closer = smaller cone
Easy to do slowly, hard to do fast
Lmao alright
Anything that uses the mod loader means you’ll only be able to play with people with the same mods
So yes, only modded lobbies
No
Only for music tracks that play in your MP4
You’d have to unpack the game files, modify them, then repack
Which sorta sounds like cheating to me
Modifying the game files sorta seems like cheating
Reddit users trying not to make something completely random up (very hard)
:sus: there’s one among us
Ehhhh the heli can turn around, but there’s extremely little chance the bullets hit
Wdym?
Jets have way better glide ratio, idk if that’s “drag” to lift ratio but still
I posted in VAF, but for the sake of search ability, the radar angle is 120 vertical and horizontal
And like normal, radar “range” is hard to say. Boats have a thicc RCS tho so
You can generally g-pull a single missile with little to no energy loss, the counter is correctly spaced missiles
Two missiles at different energy states are the best, I typically fire one missile, crank 60 degrees and wait a second, then fire a second missile
Off bore intentionally for different energy states
Slow missiles are more deadly in vtol for a few reasons
You have to pull *insane* amounts to get catastrophic failure
Difference between "handle 11gs for this one flight" and "handle 11gs over a 40 year lifespan"
Hardpoints/weapons themselves fail first, which is simulated in vtol
The lower limit isn't for the aircraft
its for the weapons
In the 45, you use the TSD to control your radar
the radar page isn't really useful
You don't need to lock on to fire (or even have the radar on), all you have to do is select a target on the TSD
CAW is best
yes
waiting till its closer to chaff it helps
In the F-45, staying in a notch can help so that even at the edges of its search cone it won't see you
Other than that yeaaaa it just do like reacquiring a lot
Chaff + terrain is good
Landing, gun shots, or specific cases in BFM
Lower your collective
yeah anytime something uncontrollable starts happening/things start spinning, just gotta lower collective
Generally into hard turns you want to lower collective
The helicopter has a decent amount simulated
No you can still fly/maneuver alright, as long as you keep airspeed+roughly coordinated flight, you're good
pipekr is the best source for irl, but intuitively it makes sense to me. Who cares what produces the counter-torque force, be it vertical stab or rotor
Don't *most* helicopters have a vertical stab?
The IRL AH-64 has a vert stab, and most helicopters do as well
If you google helicopter, every photo that comes up has a vertical stab
thats got a vertical stab as well
Then ofc it would spin out of control
But tail rotor is different than entire back of the helicopter is missing
thats not true
Between engines that only work above a specific speed
and wings so small they don't produce enough lift while slow
there's plenty of reasons an aircraft could only work supersonic but not sub
I guess define "fly"
Because I wouldn't define "falling uncontrollably without thrust" as flying
parachute/one time use
and it should prob be moved to a thread
#deleted-channel
You can, but Scalar already created one and added you to it
but, threads can be created using this button
or this one
I used the channel id, `#deleted-channel`
Issue is im not a member of the thread so it dosn't come up
They just see #deleted-channel
If you have altitude, point nose at ground and enter a nice fast dive, then pull out in such a way that requires having G-limiter off
More than once iv manuver killed the guy behind me bcs they could only pull 9gs
like a separate channel?
Iv found some success chaffing in the 94 if I was going fast
you generally don't want to lead the target yourself, just place the GPS point on the boat directly when you fire
Get behind terrain is the #1 tip
Don't be somewhere without terrain :risitas:
If you slow down to a hover and drop your pylons you'll normally be able to notch
and if you speed up you can chaff but thats not super trivial to do
Actually increasing collective is prob good for dodging missiles bcs it makes the engine decrease for a sec
Nah cuz the increase in collective causes the rotors to flex more, which cuz centripetal force increases RPM for a sec
so less engine work
Yea but long enough to flare
But yeah you want to yank it up, then lower it down
The F/A-26b manual has some good information about it  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hw-2TRqzCNrhTMwxESI6Q87yQoB-amw-8Y_G2tiaRLk/edit?usp=sharing
Section 2.8
np
65 will
Yeah if you are in an F-45 just rain 145s lmao
Yeah and another 12 external
You aren't wrong, but no one was saying the wasp can carry 145s
"The scenario I keep finding myself in is I have AGM-145s "
"Wasp can't carry 145s anyway"
Makes no sense
No the 65s are fairly different weapons. Its larger/heavier/does more damage
145s can't kill bunkers, which is the big advantage of the 65, but other than that 145s are better in every way
Nah the 65 is the only regular AGM that can kill it, all the other regular AGMs can't tho
Those are GBU-39s, so yes
They are identical to the 39s other aircraft get, just they have a tiny rocket motor on it
Just get nice and close but don't merge
The pylons have *some* RCS, its not huge, but is there. So to go back to being *totally* stealth yes you need to jet them
that was patched
its full smooth
Flaps matter, was tested with flaps 1
Enabling RCS gives you better low-speed control, but other than that its as you described, stick and rudders. There's no "trick" to getting it right, its just practice with minute inputs to get it lined up, if you sent a video where you were struggling I might be able to point out what you are doing wrong
Also put your TGP on the tank and the gun will better compensate for drop (and motion if the tank is moving)
*Generally* its best to minimize how you manouver, especially as the most common use of IR missiles in BVR is to make someone have to destroy their airspeed by throttling down
The trick in close-in BVR fights is to minimize how much energy you spend to dodge a missile
I use "BVR" to refer to missions where you have access to medium range missiles and spawn far apart
Sure the fights transitioned WVR but its still a *part* of a BVR fight
BVR starts BVR and transitions WVR, the BVR -> WVR transition is still a part of BVR
There's a massive difference between a pure "dogfight"/"WVR" than the types of close in encounters you have in BVR
then.. you are doing it wrong
In a close in engagment you should fire both a heater and a 120 back to back
And the range of heaters in vtol is ~10nm so you should def still be using both at that range
?
AIM-120s are basically considered a dogfight missile IRL
the ones we have in vtol are actually comparibly easy to dodge close in
thats what im saying
before the merge
but close in
The missile flies that low anyways, so, launch altitude dosn't matter *that* much
you disagree? Based on what?
I didn't present an opinion, its just a fact
By an extremely slim margin, its a cruise missile not a normal missile
thats just wrong lmao
nan
Do the math or test in game
Yeah just go fast
For a carrier you don't fly a speed, you fly an aoa
So fly whatever speed gives you an 8 aoa
flaps let you fly *slower* at an 8 aoa
You can maintain level flight at 100 knots
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rh2ZlxwtfRvLU1q3uzpQEoHefu8r5HnEGBO4AsEHv0Y/edit
I don't either, just pins
it does its just a lil finiky
Fun fact, you can do that with the radar off as well even though you can't see the cursors
As in no vY? Yes
velocity y-axis
That is level on the horizon line?
The velocity vector is on the horizon line
Unless you define level flight as 0 aoa, which in that case practically no aircraft is ever at "level flight"
"usesless besides"..? Thats its job, tell you where your nose is pointing
Like, the velocity vector is useless besides telling you where your velocity is pointing
whitename
Tis a helicopter, it is what it does. You need to counter the rotation by yawing the opisite direction
np
maddog goes only for teammates
You rotate about the X-axis, so pitch?
Having issues with pitch seems weird, could you send a video?
Orange = MWS proximity
so the MWS system has detected a nearby missile with a significant closure rate
Missle launch is yellow
Orange is just "close by missile is closing/coming at you"
it uses an IR sensor to do this, so hotter missiles are detected from farther away
For the 26b its just directly above
the F-45 is weird, but the spots are really small
Twist knob to deired setting, then while holding the knob press the button you use for weapon switch (on the hand holding the knob)
Easiest way for casual is just take more fuel lol
Just practice tbh. You can use the TADS to see through the aircraft. If you send a clip of your attempts we may be able to point out something going wrong, but likely just need some practice
No work tomorrow
You are probably on my custom server, on that server everyone is given a ranking score or “elo”
The number goes up and down as you get kills/die
When you spawn in your fuel will be set to your score for a few seconds
You can also check via a bot in my discord server
Damn not even home and already trying to recruit
^ in a dogfight you'll be hearing stall warning extremely often
Normally you'd use jetison rather than firing them
but yes thats normal, if you need to dogfight you'll want to drop some weight
especially AG weapons and fuel tanks
If you have fuel tanks, use the "FUEL" jetison option
Otherwise if you want to dump from the internal, use the "fuel dump" switch, its on the back right
For the 26b
the f45 fuel dump is a submenu under SMS
back left I am wrong
I meant left
nothing
I was wrong
I typo
neo
get the thing
okay, missile info dump  Different types of missiles Fox-1 Semi-active radar-guided (most common SAM sites use this) which will be indicated on RWR with a tone and the host radar turning red upon missile launch Fox-2 IR guided missiles, (most shorter range missiles) which will never be detected RWR, but can get detected with MWS (which will display on the RWR screen) assuming it isnt in a blindspot Fox-3 Active radar-guided missiles (most common medium-range A2A missiles) which will always indicate itself on RWR as a red "M" upon pitbull, and most of the time the host radar will maintain a lock up until pitbull   How to spot different types of missiles If the thing shooting at you has a red circle around it and that special noise, its a fox-1 If there's no red circles, and only a MWS warning, its a fox-2 If there's a M with a red circle, its a fox-3
"FOX-1" is just the name of a type of missile
specifically semi-active radar guided
pitbull means a fox-3 type missile has switched to its internal radar
blame neo he wrote it
You have to be p slow
but also go into EQUIP and enable gimbled
yeah lol
or the nearest teammate
if you want the full TSC its not suuuuuper straight forward iirc, C-137 tried giving the F/A-26b it and hit a bunch of issues
Here "flare" means to pull the nose up when near the ground
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_flare
nan
Hopfully trainer helps 🙏
The F-45 can "cobra" in the same way that a flatspinning F-15 is "supermaneuverable"
Iv got one too
#off-topic
1) don't talk about breaking discord tos here 2) off-topic in #off-topic, but again no talkin about breaking discord tos
The aircraft attempts to counteract motions of the helicopter that weren't commanded by you
as close as safely possible
you always want to be closer before you fire
Increase your RCS, either by showing your belly or in the F-45 open your bay doors
Yeah generally just show belly/exit the notch so it locks you
For a non-maneuvering target, the missile behaves identically with a constant lock as it does if you immediately loose the lock off launch
Supposed to? Yes its not a bug
Such as?
Yeah it doesn't have that, probably because the radar is used as a primary sensor so infrequently that when there are close togeater targets you should just use the tads
iv not personally had an issue using it without an expand mode
most of the time things like radar dishes are sufficiently spaced that I can get them
nah 145s can fire over the hill
Nah external tanks cannot be refueled
eh thats realistic, unless there were two target in fingertip formation, the missile aint gunna find the new target
Which is why IRL once the lock was lost, the chance of reaquiring even the *same* target again was very low
For voice commands you never need to include your own callsign
fox-4
rifle is AGM
Yeah, so for vtol just the AIM-7
Magnum
it switches, uses the buls if possible otherwise uses bearing, I can't remember the logic for when it uses what
I believe a bogey dope is always bearing
Why do you want to get back to 20k feet? Beyond 10k feet the altitude isn't that important unless you are trying for long range shots, and low energy = low speed missiles = more deadly
got to over 100k lol
nan
nan
dcs phoenixes get very high as well, they take off and go practically vertical
If you fire straight up it'll get to 400k
nan
No they'll fly whatever angle they want, they don't follow the aircrafts loft at all
Nice so our aircraft carrying 16 of them is prob a warcrime
Easier G-pulling
Notching pre-lock actually got buffed pretty well, so the best use of notching is out-right preventing the launch/lock
its a been a bit, but there was a big update that basically entirely reworked how pvp worked
The "radar changes" thread was created 04/21/2022
Before that the moment a lock was lost the missile was gone
which was one of the reasons why the RCS bug was so bad, doing just a roll would instantly defeat every missile on you
There's no reason, hardpoint limitation or price is the only reason you'd use a worse option
For HS, using worse weapons tends to give much better elo
so its normal for good players to be running around with AIM-7s and AIM-9Es
When it comes to notching, the difference between a 120 and a 120D is the D can recieve non-radar data about you, meaning you often can't notch the *host radar*, when it comes to the missile radar itself its identical
then a 120 and 120D are identical
:bruh:
No need to be an ass about it
:Crycat:
Yea
No those are exactly when the missile enables its internal radar, but that dosn't mean they'll actually see the target then
IRL (and what we do in game) first wire is the worse, the third wire is your target
In order of worst to best, 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
np, first wire being the best is a common missconception
the reason its not is its the closest to planting it right into the back of the boat
You want to aim for exactly the mid-point, so between the 2 and 3 wires, which means you'll grab the third
👀
no not most of the time
If its a match with missiles you are often screwed, if its a bfm lobby what does running away achieve
What would be more favorable?
An F-45 won't be completely still, a smart F-45 will also watch as you fly right by without slowing down before they fully commit
Yea but unless you are trying head-on shots (dont) then its just gunna be anohter merge
eventually you have to commit to the fight
Not if you just fly away and reset
Yeah but why are you even in the lobby if you don't want to fight?
The F_45 will always be at an advantage
If you never fight, why are you there?
I mean the better question is why are you BFMing F-45s
Better IR missiles, better TWR/acceleration, way more fun, more maneuverable around terrain, less likely to hit terrain etc etc etc
but HS shows its statistically true
The F-45 is more likely to run into terrain than the 26b
hydras, 89s, and g-pulling
yea but 26b has an easier time
which weapon?
39s?
wait does the 45 even have 39s
iirc its only 38s
how fast are you going?
id have to see a video then
Only when i feel like drifing in weird ways
sometiems yaw assist off can be a help but I never bother
They are different aircraft with different capabilities
Same reason the 26b dosnt have 145s or 53s
And the 45 dosnt have 65s or 89s
It does have an easier time notching, for for quirks in how vtol works sometimes that’s an issue
Four for, better?
create a line of GPS points with the last point being the target then press "path"
select the first GPS point and fire
There's no set value tbh, basically "enough". Over time you'll get a feel for when a missile will be easy to chaff (so only need a few) and when it'll be hard to chaff
Game -> Manage -> Players
There will be a button there
not normally, but if the tank is on fire, yes
Not about sensitivity, tanks and what not just straight up don't produce heat unelss they are on fire
I though tthat used a different seeker
nan
Tho right next to it it also says they messed around with firing the IR guided versions at tanks
yes
it does have weapons
It just looks better with one
Multiple is cring
Ig I could put *every* aircraft there
might do that actually
"<ERR>" yea its confirmed
Thats the AH-94s Birthday
Also I don't have enough characters lmao
No ETA
It’s confined to be able to carry ordnance
Correct
The missiles are welded on
> You only have to chaff when the missile can’t see you (disappears from rwr) Chaff is only effective when the missile is locked onto you
If the missile isn't on your rwr, chaff does nothing (you can chaff the host aircraft radar pre-pitbull, but need to be in a beam compared to it)
I heavily heavily doubt a rwr would be capable of detecting a radar alt
*Maybe* if you flew to position one of the antennas directly underneath it
Frequency, cone, power-output
and I suspect there's lots of things, such as the way radars change their frequency while scanning that the radar alt dosn't do
which may throw off the rwr
Now I do bet you could *hear* it via the rwr
At least some rwr's (such as the F-15's) will do a direct audio out so you can hear what radar is hitting the plane
you can but its not recommended
nan
you can gpull air-launched IR as well ^
probably
idk why he'd be carrying 9s over AIRS-T but seems likely
Going to idle/low throttle and flaring before the launch is the most reliable method
all that really matters is you aren't neagive g
because you are flying "into" your flares
you shouldn't be making *any* manuver to the extent that you risk red/blackout
not by an insane margin
For a single missile you shouldn't blackout, its about timing your G-pull
Somewhat? Not too agressively
145s have no DL
they guide on "points", so when fired they have a target point that they are going to, they use their optical sensor to search around that point
they account for motion
the target point uses the velocity at launch
I don't believe it'll account for motion that the TGP dosn't see
Ie, it won't predict motion for a LOAL target even if the TSD knows about that motion
Yeah confirmed that, if no LOS you don't get a moving target point
No, no DL in any situation, but when you have your TGP on a moving target, the moment you pull the trigger the aircraft tells the missile the current target position and velocity
from there the missile is on its own using last know target position and updating with the last known velocity
However hitting moving targets behind hills the aircraft does not give a velocity to the missile at all, so it assumes a static target
The vtol aim120s at least don't enable their radar's early even if contact is lost, they fly the profile like normal, so you are simply making your pK worse by turning off your radar
There's an extremely specific situation that turning off your radar is useful to stop guidance updates but its very very niche
Fuel is rarely an issue, for munitions it’s just one weapon per target, not much you can optimize there other than carry more munitions
I’m talking about infantry
Just bcs it makes me right
F-45 holds 24 145s
26b can carry 31 GBUs
They're capable of destroying every land unit in one hit
Naval units can be a bit tankier but still can be destroyed by 39s
I dunno an AWACS has a bunch of hp
Yeah I just checked
An AWACS will tank a 39 hit
Not a 38 hit tho
it wont
AWACS has 200 hp
39 does 150 damage
85
yea
Weapons have RCS but no aircarft drag
Basically  One circle = you are turning to their nose = want smallest circle Two circle = you are turning to their tail = want best rate
whitename opinion invalid
rate is how quickly you are turning in degrees per second
"turn circle" is the type of fight or "circle" you are tracing with your aircraft
As explained above there is two types, one circle or two circle
The easiest solution is to turn a bit left/right, non-TWS targets won't "stick" to the screen and will slide off, letting you select them
it is a thing irl
often called "expand" or "raid" mode
Missile pK should be *higher* than back then, unless your opponents are using chaff
No, it *can* but its meant for aircraft primarially
Why not?
They are the most capable IR missile in the game
yes
AIM-9s are just worse in every way
AI can sometimes be pretty good at chaffing, try firing either tail or nose aspect
F-45 is a different aircraft with different capabilities, many weapons straight up don't fit on it
anti-ship is really its only missing capability gap
The TSD auto-locates RWR pings
Anything you could see on ARAD you can see on TSD
AGM-145s have great range as well, nearly equal to the AGM-88
Google will not provide any use here
What does that mean?
What a weapon looks like dosn't control what it can kill
SDBs work as well
Small diameter bombs
> Since you don't have ARAD AV-42c has ARAD
Are you holding an STT or TWS lock until the pitbull callout?
Seems good to me
an vs a is the biggest possible issue I see
Saying "AIM-120s usually work pretty well" is hard, its entirely situational. My AIM-120 pK is very low but I know *why*, often the shots I take I don't expect to hit. If you are reliably seeing them miss a video might help
Yes but it was the clearest way to ask teh question, and its not wrong either. If they don't hold teh lock they don't hear pitbull so they aren't holding the lock until the pitbull
Was a reply to Jaiden, I said "an stt" rather than "a stt"
"a single target track" "an single target track"?
I say "n ess-tee-tee", no a at all lmao
There are three discussions currently - `a stt` vs `an stt` - Is asking "lock until pitbull" logical as you don't get a pitbull call without a lock - Why AIM-120 no worky  Only one of these is on topic
It does but the DLZ can be inaccurate at times
Tho with a hot target you should be fine
And the 45 should have roughly the same pK as the 26 if you hold the lock the entire time
The missile preformance itself should be nearly identical
AI behavior may be a bit differently, but unless they are engaging you it shouldn't change
Do you have ARAD HUD on?
Meaning what, as in its possible IRL, or as in they *do* it IRL?
For killing ships the easiest solution is to G-pull, most of their missiles are extremely unmanuverable, for this low altitude is better
against a super missile cruiser you'll want to chaff off the missile once its close
yes its possible and has been done, especially against SAMs
Only boat with IR is the enemy carrier, but why are you getting so close that you are being fired at by IR?
nan
The red flashing when its the launcher itself means its a SARH missile, so yes radar missile
DS *can* be linked to other missiles but in this case yeah BSM-66s and BSM-66LRs
its a static ground radar
DC is for the drone carrier/DMS cruiser
DS is static ground radar
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Radar_Warning_Receiver_(RWR)
In the video I had BSM-66s fired from a DS and a SA radar, MAD-4 fired from a MAD-4 (that I never dodged as it was far away), RIM-67B from MC, and Super missile's from LR
MC and LR are on the same boat
No, at most you get a launch warning
To explain a bit, the "RWR" display actually shows two independent systems that both display over each other on that screen they are: **RWR - Radar warning receiver**, displays any radar energy that passes over your plane (scanning or locking), the first occasional pinging you hear is their radar scan passing over your aircraft as it scans the sky, the continous tone is when the target locks you, that is, the radar energy is being constantly sent at you. Finally you have the active radar homing warning, which is a more urgent tone and the target will be denoted with a red "M" on the RWR.   **MWS - Missile warning system**, displays nearby missiles, it does this by looking for the thermal signature of missile rocket motors. It has two warnings, "launch warning" when the initial kick/thrust of a missile is detected, or the "missile warning". Launch warning is a yellow semi-circle on the outer ring of the RWR display, and missile warning is the two orange lines that shows more precisly where a nearby missile is. The RWR is 100% consistant and will never miss something, where the MWS can be very inconsistant due to blindspots and the missiles having cooled down
The easiest way is G-pulling, which you can see in my video
The same applies, chaff as well
Generally you just care about what *type* of missile it is, so fox-1 fox-2 or fox-3
1 and 3 show on RWR
1 = SARH
being that high is *generally* not a good idea
I mean it does as you can outrange their missiles
I’d argue killing the enemy before they can shoot is a viable missile evasion tactic
it retains *some* heat still and gains a bit of heat based off its speed
RWR has no blindspots, MWS is directly above
It allows you to see if your own radar is providing data on a target, which is important for a few reasons, can also quickly tell you what targets are in los
Ohh for having radar *on*?
There's a bunch
The biggest reason I use it is with POINT mode on to quickly tell when targets are in LOS as I come over a mountain
The radar constantly tries to STT whatever you have selected on your TSD
You won't have a *problem* without it but you can use it to your advantage
It may provide data you wouldn't otherwise get quicker than you would oitherwise
Especially when fighting other F-45s
Oh yeah no for PVE it really dosn't matter on/off
Personally for PVE I just keep it on all the time lol
Without mods people have gotten a bit over 90k
An AIM-120 has been recorded at over 400k
wow changing your tune I see how it is
nan
This is the highest iv seen posted https://canary.discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/739139812602413057/991839093195550750
No don't believe the photo, the photo shows over 1 million feet anyways
I *think* the 45 produces the same amount of total thrust in AB as it does in VTOL mode
as the lift fan provides thrust, otherwise you know, you'd spin and flip all over
I believe so
Iirc the lift fan draws nearly no fuel
The way its implemented in vtol is with two engines, lift fan has its own little one
and also the connection dosn't change the fact that it provides thrust lol
if I double the intake and blade area of an engine its gunna provide more thrust
Something something jet engines are weird. I don't know the physics behind it, but as the bypass ratio of an engine increases its efficiency increases (this is why airliners use high bypass engines), connecting the lift fan is effectively increasing the bypass ratio
So the total lift produced for a unit of fuel increases
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bypass_ratio#:~:text=Nevertheless%2C%20high%2Dbypass%20engines%20have,the%20engine)%20multiplied%20by%20the
Takes about 40 to 45 seconds, aint that bad
"Faster" than what? Startup can take ~40-45 seconds
Generally just make sure to go to full power immediately and start the second engine once the first engine is at `E`
is sustained min radius even something we care about?
The two main ones is best sustained rate and best instantaneous trt
Don't fight jets lol
But yeah stingers aren't great, have to be p close to hit them with them traveling directly at or away from you
gun ends up working alright
The target practice mission is the only built in mission that has jets the game asks you to kill, all the other ones are A2G exclusively unless you fuck up
yep
Nah in vtol the rotor blade dosn't cause issues
turn on ARAD HUD
both PVE and COOP
lock on after launch
Easiest way is to not get shot at in the first place, but if you do get shot at terrain
Put a mountain between you and the missile
I disagree, when used properly its more reliable than flares
It'll loose the STT and swtich back to just regular scanning pings
warh
145
*~~but I thought the radar update was going to make it impossible to dodge missiles~~*
Important to separate systems: The RWR only shows radar emissions, it cares not for closure/collision course The MWS indicates when it detects the IR sig of a nearby missile, this *does* care about closure/course    The MWS also has the launch warning, which does not care about closure as its a single point event
It is and thus gets confusing
Tbh calling it a Threat Warning Display would be more accurate/better, but the game calls it the RWR so its the RWR
tru
Ehhhhhhhhhh
To me the RWR display just also displays the MWS. They are very separate systems with different functionality and mechanics
Its not perfect but the NAV page can provide bulls if you slew it over the target
AIRS-Ts are far far far far from useless, often they are considered more deadly than AIM-120s. Where'd you hear they are useless?
Yeah AIRS-Ts are better than AIM-9s
Ye toss bombing with CCRP is more or less the same
The only X that shows up with bombs is a bug
nan
Very likely its the bug fixed in 1.6
No
Exactly the same yeah
jetison gets rid of the external racks
If you've only *shot* them you'll have some extra RCS
that was fixed iirc
nan
nan
It could do quite a bit :Crycat:
nan
Only two values for the radar wave is transmit power and reciever sensitivity
Functionally they are just multiplied together
Basically both factors into an equation that determines if target in range
There's not a *super* simple way to calculate it. Iv written sims for it, but there's a lot of factors that go into it. - Range - Transmit str - Recieve sens - Aspect - Relative target altitude - Terrain behind target - Closure rate
All are fed into the radar equation
Clean 26 headon = ~16nm Loaded 26's iv locked at 60nm
Sold by apple?
yea the graph has all the radar powers, MAD-4 is the highest
*Except* for the AWACS
The AWACS is so absurdly powerful it makes the graph nearly unusable
Overall it dosn't, just some specific angles
All the "in-plane", that is same-altitude angles are far less
the 26b's large and flat wings mean above-below it has more
Landing gear applies drag
Some people do, im not convinced its worth it. I personally don't
tho it can be very fun
There isn't really one, best option is to be behind terrain
Doing larger/shallower turns helps
but also do you care about flashing your belly while turning around? You should be turning cold so should be safe
If you turn cold most of the time you are safe because the enemies effective missile range is much shorter, you just gotta make sure you turn cold before they are right on top of you
Means running away
"hot" means going to the enemy, "cold" means away
Even people just 13nm away can't really do much if you go cold
if it worked yes
Dunno, is hard
yeah
Can't rn as its still very broken and rarely works without me manually fixing things
hold trigger + menu button
In PVP missions with SAMs ill often carry a few as they are small, light, and great for quick self-protection
I do too, but they are great when you aren't meant to be doing SEAD, carry just one or two just incase
If you are locking onto it, its not maddog
IR weapons don't have a maddog mode
But yes, you can lock the fire
Also I don't think the maddog aim120 code would work here lol
:risitas:
Nah the missile still waits to the regular radar enable point based off the predicted track
basically, for a target that is not maneuvering, its impossible to tell if the launcher aircraft is guiding it the whole time, or if they turned off their radar immediately. The AIM-120 will behave identically in both cases
Yep, if you don't have it as SOI you can just observe it
When I am with a gunner I don't trust ill have TADS up, for a gunner I do trust ill have radar up to ID targets
Can you write a message with every manual/relevent info
I'll unpin the others and pin that one message
Pinned a message.

Other than using metric the entire fucking time
kn/ft/nm is the standard for aviation (and shipping) basically everywhere
There's an AoA readout on the HUD
An a physical indextor with lights on the left
And the E bracket, when your velocity vector is aligned with the middile tick thats 8 aoa
I don't thin k its called a "case-1" but there's similar approaches
And there's no reason why you couldn't just do a "case-1-like" landing, with simular altitudes/placements
Isn't that the same thing?
"pop up to hit the superstructure" "pop up to hit the deck", both are hitting the top of the boat it just depends on what happens to be there
it hits at somewhat of an angle
not that it really matters for the sake of vtol
> Can I delete the GPS points/path after I release a gps guided weapon, but prior to its impact? You *should* be able to, I have a superstition that you can't, however I havn't bothered to test
It makes the radar constantly attempt to acquire an STT on whatever you have selected
Normally when notching is where you see it in the 26b
There are 4 modes: Caged -> Forward facing  Uncaged -> Small radius circle,  will slave to radar, will follow any heat sig it sees Vertical scan -> Scan pattern starting in the center of the hud and going up Head slaved -> Slaved to wherever you are looking
"Trig uncage" option which can apply to caged, vert and head means when the trigger is head the seeker locks onto the heatsource its pointed at and tracks it
trig uncage? Trig uncage just controls if the seeker keeps following the mode you've set or if you can hold trigger to make it follow the heat source
Yeee for AGMs trig-uncage gives you a better off-bore ability
Please keep it like that
im a break enthusiast
nan
:Crycat:
Communication at night
Makes it easier to know who is targeting what
uh im not sure what that means
but you can see it with NODs at night
IRL they don't manually hover at all, its all VCAP anytime the engine is rotated
In game VCAP can be used fully to takeoff->transition and transition->land
In game its much easier to slow down without VCAP
IRL the lift fan is capable of blowing backwards and the engine can rotate past 90 which helps slow down
I don't think a video is needed, just create multiple GPS points and make sure its set to `AUTO` in the bomb settings so that when you drop a bomb it automatically switches to the next target
the bomb has two options: Target mode: (manual) (auto) -> manual means GPS points do not automatically increment, auto means they do Auto Rel Rate: (single) (120) (240) (480) -> single means one bomb drops per button press, the numbers mean it'll drop at that given rate (in bombs per minute)
np
Fuel consumption is unaffected by speed or altitude
Yep
yes
And mach number effects drag as well (with all the transonic effects)
All RWRs in VTOL are perfect 360
Yeah
The MWS has some blindspots, but not the RWR
For the 26 and 94 its directly above the aircraft (94 is wider-above), for the 45 its very small, two thin conical regions emitting at the 1/11 o'clock angled slightly down
No, maybe I can convince @C-137 to make one
tbh I don't think a diagram is useful here, in the 26 just understand "MWS blindspot above you, so be sure to look out" is all the info you need
For the 45 its small enough to basically not matter, TSD will show the missile anyways
both
Have a good TWR?
Are you starting on the ground or in-air?
If you are - On the ground - High TWR - press VCAP it instantly disengages?
can you record it? I might be able to spot whats wrong
200knots is too fast
Yeah you land way later than you expect
You have to TWS them, so circle around them/number next to em
Landings should be an 8 AoA with a 3 degree glideslope, so velocity vector 3 degrees below the horizon with nose 5 degrees up
Its not about "efficient" its about what the aircraft gear/flight is capable/made for
and for carrier landings aoa is important so you hit the deck at the correct angle for the hook to engage correctly
Not sure what you mean "yellow line", if you are talking about the AoA indexor then thats not a line related to teh HUD, but rather juts an indication of where your aoa is relative to 8, the middle yellow ball means you are on the correct aoa
Ohhhhh
that instrument shows lineup (vertical line) and glideslope (horizontal line)
You want the yellow line to be straight through the middile so it forms one continuous line
If the yellow line is above the mid-point that means you are too low, and you need to go slightly up   "up" here means not actually up, but to slightly decrease your rate of descent so you re-intercept the glideslope
yes
but of course if you speed up, aoa decreases, which means you need to increase pitch. A little bit, not much
I don't think this is "technically" correct but the easiest way for me is to just do very small pitch corrections while using power to maintain aoa
power, right for lineup
glideslope matters much less than aoa, if you have the correct aoa and put the velocity vector on the boat, *most* of the time you'll end up with an about correct glideslope
yep
Well w should be *on* the 5
In the photo posted the pilot is a touch slow, so his nose is a bit higher
Once an engine is lost to damage it cannot be brought back without reparing
One air-starts you can do are for fuel or intentional shutoff
All the fixed wing aircraft in vtol are pure fbw, the 94 has mechanical linkage to the rotor systems with fbw for the fixed control surfaces
chaff is generally considered one of the best ways to defeat a missile
chaff, G-pull, and terrain are the big top 3 that are used
Everything that has been mentioned by me/above is for radar missiles
for IR missiles just throttle down and drop a short burst of flares
I don't bother trying to switch to save them
I rarely run out of cms
I do, I just use terrain
Weapons are always the limiting factor, CMS is rarely the issue
depends on the SAM, MAD-4 is the longest at about 26nm
Range they will launch at and range they *could* hit at is different, thats the range they will launch at
It'll be *nearly* as effective, the issue is the "perfect 90" is *quite* precise, so when trying to you'll prob not get it
I explained some of it here https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/319915885575798785/1021891590916153414
uh
wdym?
Yeah
Its stored as a table of view angle vectors with an RCS value, when a radar hits an aircraft it interpolates between the pre-calculated rcs vectors for the vector for that angle
that chart is for radar power
There's no single one equation that describes the radar, there's a set of conditions that modify/change the exact behavior
This is my implementation
but you can see even that is calling out to other methods
The heart of the equation is this
Oh but thats also missing the logic for stt/tws buffs
The awacs isn't in that photo
That photo is transmission strength * recierver sensitivity
Ehhhhh
issue is `getRadarSignalStrength` cares about RCS Notching/doppler Ground clutter  all in the same method
and I missed stt/tws buffs as well
Those all factor in
The F-45 transmission strenght is 125000, the AWACS is 300000
yes
I wrote a program for it, let me move around different units at different airspeeds and altitudes
They do
Radar goes through the aircraft and continues on to hit terrain yeah
it don't work very good
or at all rn :risitas:
I program for the fun of programming, once im not interested anymore I go do somethin else
Nah I program for money 8hrs a day, no need to do even more lol
my current project folders lol
Sorted by language
If your radar is off, yes
no
once its pitbull its on its own entirely
Which one is it?
nan
AB dosn't effect radar stealth
Radar off, keep internal weapons only, don't expose to much surface area to the enemy radar (nose-on is the most stealthy)
irl it has *some* effect yeah but its not that major
vtol it dosn't have any effect
no its rMax and rOpt
range optimal, also called NER (no escape range), basically even if they turn around and run the missile will reach
@Freedomplaza mottom
given that I enabled the mod I hope im OK with it :risitas:
its a curated list of mods that have zero gameplay impact, other mods that actually change major aspects of the game don't work
hydras do not produce heat
Personally iv seen in-game to be more toxic than the discord
Here's a list of all of them https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLWW-bbyfJEuQnnMmhSoCq39m3Ge5fxL11G_qbVDd88/edit#gid=2059608664
that was removed a long time ago
~50nm
give or take some
~~Not for the 161~~ what he said
89 is more effected by altitude due to higher drag, but its safe to say they are about the same range
The 89 has 3x the thrust, which would imply higher range
What that chart dosn't show is the drag
Thats how long the motor itself is burning for
missiles in vtol can stay around indefinitely
I suspect the way this works IRL is the missile uses INS to track its location since launch
Perhaps GPS as well
It dosn't use the radar to track the missile, while radars can pick up missiles its very difficult for a fightre FCR to detect missiles, unless specifically in a mode to search for them (ie low RCS and correct PRF)
The radar on the AIM-120 is much smaller and weaker compared to your own aircraft, it won't be able to see the target until its much closer
pitbull means the AIM-120 sitched to its internal radr
I’m not sure what you mean, but generally yes the game is a bit more complex than binary yes/no
Notching and it’s effect is based off closure rate and distance to the ground behind you
intentional off bore shots around terrain can be insane
hydras are the heaviest thing you can equip
Actually wait tnaks probably are
Fuel tank is lighter
Hydra 70 x57 x3 pylon weights 815
So full hydra full fuel FCR and 230 is your heaviest loadout
The brimstone is close to the 145
smoke breaks laser as well
They'd see the missile pinging them before it locks them
tldr don't use maddog lol
Thats what the gun funnel is for
smoke blocks light pretty well, which is why smoke is used as a countermeasure to laser-guided things on the ground
and why many ground vehicles have a laser warning system
Aparently many tanks carrier IR blocking smoke
nan
Indeed, shiny smoke. Smoke with metal particals in it
some even works as chaff as well
you can, but LSO calling wave off and then missing the wires will be corolated lol
LSO *is* waving you off for a reason
You likely have the wrong AOA or are landing too early. You don't want to "roll over" the wires you want to land *on* them
And need an 8 aoa
when the LSO waves you off he'll give you a reason if you open the LOG mfd page
VTOL is like half a degree off (can't remember up or down, I think 8.5), but yeah hold the nose up 5 degrees and have teh velocity vector 3 degrees below the horizon and you'll be good
The gun funnel lets you lead the correct amount for a turning target at a given range
you put the enemies wingtips on either side of the funnel, and thats the correct lead
no, the wingtips should be *just* touching both sides
nan
Thats the gun funnel, its coming in 1.6
pull power to idle and flare
its decently significant. More importantly I sorta think there might be something fucky with engine RPMs that means pulling straight to idle makes it cool quicker. I havn't looked into this that much however
helps quite a bit. A long trail of flares can "lead" the IR missile to the fresh hotter flares you are just dropping, effecitvely still guiding the missile onto you
Sadly thats not an option
the only options you have are to make it release a specific number of flares per minute
and which bucket to use, which you can set "double" which uses both buckets at the same time, but not *really* groups
out-of-plane shots will be difficult yea
I mean
thats realistic
yeah
F15 and 18 both have the vtol style pipper with a radar lock, the F-16 has a radar mode but it displays slightly differently. Still same idea of put the thing on the thing and it'll hit tho
its retaining the pipper
Just requires a radar lock
No more magic automatic pipper
Yea
shut the fuck up C
No way its that good
It do
thats a fact
it has em correct iirc
nan
nan
Don't ping baha for random questions especially about t55 lol
No once you have an enemy aircraft in front of you you’ll get the magic box around them and a perfect pipper/lead
Yeah that’s the magic lol, it dosnt use the radar, can track people behind terrain and without los, and dosnt ping their rwr
It’s just the game trying to figure out which aircraft you are targeting, it’ll automatically switch to a different aircraft if you hold them on the nose for a second or two
TGP gives you regular pipper, pointing at the ground with the funnel gives you a new symbol that uses the height map to try to calculate, so its a bit less accurate
well the plane dosn't know if you are still in a dogfight or going to strafe a tank
so the funnel is still there
just you get some extra symbology when pointed at the ground
yeah irl you press a button in the SMS to tell the plane you are ready to strafe
the vtol one works fine, personally I always TGP lock the target anyways
and you have a tgp monkey with you (wso)
dont fly those aircraft
its quite fun
This? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16DD8d1NudAGreoYmacUhVrwygP6oRgFtgGqJXnbI4Jc/edit#gid=0
AIM-9+ has better seeker range, better manuverability, better CCM, better thrust etc
Its better in basically every way
AIRS-T is that as well, but even betererer
AIM-9+ and AIRS-T are fairly comparible missiles, AIRS-T is better but not by too much
Change the message above the image and ill pin the photo
Pinned a message.
Pinned a message.
Once they've pitbulled, they are fully on their own. They will not return to the 45s dl
There's splash and its not small, just likely your sense of scale is a bit off
A mk82 has a 50m radius
18m x 18m
thats what boresight is for
maddog is terrible for close range due to the 1s activation delay
still boresight is far faster to fire and tracks way better
thats what I meant by boresight
Boresight is better for that specifically as well
maddog will almost certainly all lock the same target
and takes multiple seconds to fire each missile
yeah
gotta be carful with the 55
the mirror and control knob do nothing when you are alone, so they aren't there
those and the switch seat button are the only differecnes sp vs mp
No its more about seperation from you and the people directly around you
I nearly always have it off, even when just flying around
The stick response is somewhat changed, so if you intend to fly with it off at any point I’d recommend just always having it off
its so ingrained that I end up opening the fuel dump in the T-55 bcs thats where the glim is in the 26
220 is pretty fast, that's probably overspeeding your gear irl (or close to it)
*Need?*
I don't think iv ever *needed* to land at that speed
arms?
like weapons?
Weapons will effect your RCS
Ohhhhhh
I read "viable" as "visible"
I don't think it should be pinned at all -_-
which is why its not needed lol
I didn't say that, and I have skimmed through. It should have been a very short say 5-10 page document going over the differences compared to the 26b, and the rewrites/edits should have been done to the 26b manual
Much much more useful to players that way
Be in the T-55, 400kn, pitch assist off, throttle to idle while pitching up quickly but smoothly, careful not to add any roll in, get the nose up above 90, let it fall back without pushing it down
you can still view TAS in the DATA page
The only TTI that the game provides is for radar guided AAMs, the 94 does not have any TTI
For chaff there's a specific wiggling action you want to use, as well as maximizing your RCS. Notching you fly with minimizing RCS and no wiggling, the only simularity between them is that you are flying in roughly a beam
Its just the average internet argument, the other side builds up a totem to point at and shake their fist
Ik thats the whole they build up the totem of the other side. The internet is all about making up what the "other side" is/believes so you can dislike it lol
