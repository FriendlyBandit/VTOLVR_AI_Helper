question when i make a scenario on a custom map made for it and i update something on the map is there a way to add the updated map to the scenario because now i need to redo the hole scenario?
Can you delete the scenario from the campaign, then readd it?
@Mr.NoLife  There is a rebuild option to update the map in the scenario

yes
Oh. Yeah. I completely misread the question

question i have a patrol path setup for some enemy boats but it look like the are not moving and just staying and the same place as were the spawn any idea what the issue is ?
i dont believe it was ever necessary to accept it to access the editor?
or at least i remember someone saying that

i can't navigate with the mouse, right?
someone sended me a link to make a senario mp compatible but cant find the link anymore  anyone that has the link by any change google is bieng a B***h
yeah that doesnt sound sus

I am confused as to what Wiki says that...?

pretty sure the FANDOM isn't that inaccurate

@ierdna100 i see youre editing the docs a tip :  add the file directory to this so its easyer to find for people new to all of this  Q:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\VTOLVR_ModLoader\mods\Multiplayer  because it can be a pain to find if you dont know were to look  How do I make custom frequencies? Change the files named “freq.txt” and “freqlabels.txt”.
not everyone has a godamn q drive
yea well Q: C: A: i guess people know were the installed the game

All the ships are in the Lima group?
yes exept the jets on the dek
And you’ve given them a bit of time to get themselves sorted out? Takes a while to get up to speed

And you’ve given them a bit of time to get themselves sorted out? Takes a while to get up to speed
The wake can take 30s or so to appear
yea even tryed a delay of 10 befor start this gave me some time for start up the jet take off and fly to them

They’re not affected by any other events?
nope
I got nothing. Sorry. I can take a look if you want to send me the scenario, but it looks like you’ve ticked all the boxes

Does the plane start on the carrier?
If yes it need a take off order
Sorry didn't rode the question properly

Question what is the differences between the mission editor and the campain i know on is just for a single mission but the campaint is that for multiple missions in one ?
A campaign is a bundle of missions essentially
question, what was the process for creating multiple out comes for missions?

quick question - If you want to open mission editor do you have to have your headset connected to navigate in-game to it or can you launch it independent? Because everything you do is on flat screen, right? Can't check by myself rn because I'm at work but I will be grateful if someone would answer to my question
you can launch it without your HMD

Afternoon all. Loving the game. Recently found steamworkshop and downloading various maps/missions/etc. Is it fairly simple to create missions? There was one in particular I loved - heading in, blowing up gnd targets, then picking up teammates from the roof of a building. Then go and search for a downed craft and pickup the crew, before returning home.
Would be great to be able to make an expansion on this. Like 5 friendly jets all heading in to evac ground troops while under fire. The SAR was very good too, apart from you didn't find crew on your own - there were waypoint markers
Daunting at first, but definitely not that difficult.

Oh, an ingame workshop mission? I was off searching steam for "killbox"
yes
imagine not using ends after your ifs

wait Scratch has an IDE?
yes, its called scratch
like competent IDE that draws CPU ressources and RAM?

no i made a framerate counter in it you dingus

Can you start a map with an NPC ally aircraft orbiting above a waypoint (holding) while you setup, take off, and rendezvous? I seem to only be able to place the other aircraft on the ground
Hold shift + mouse wheel to change the height of the cursor
Ah ha. I saw this vertical moving before, but I needed to press enter/apply before it accepted the new position

There's also vehicle control - side doors is equal to 0. Is there a better boolean to check if the doors are open?
(side doors) (is equal to) (1.0) ?
that's the control...?

what else do you wish to acquire from the doors?

what else do you wish to acquire from the doors?
There's no boolean for doors open/closed. Just door value is equal to certain value. So which value am I looking for to test when the doors are open?
should be that one

Like "call an airstrike at this location" type thing?
spawning the tanker and AWACS only in the last iteration
I made the entire thing time based at some point

Another quick Q. I can set infantry to "Board Aircraft" but only select an AI aircraft. Where's the option to board the player aircraft?
Use the Pickup objective
Ok, so I have objective "Extraction", Type: Pickup, Startmode: Triggered, Waypoint:LZ I also have an event "landed at troops", which is as above: (landed in radius of "LZ", parking brake set, doors open)

What objective type? They complete themselves under different criteria
Ah ha. I had "fly to" as the objective type but I can select "Conditional" and set them all in there. Ok, that works
Thanks for your help. That's worked really nicely

Do you think it's a bit too similar to the other chap's one to upload to the workshop? Or is there another way for you to test it
If you send the .vtm file, we should be able to load it and try it, but it'd be very easy for someone to plagiarise. So I'd only do it to people you trust
is that a actual worry in vtol?

is that a actual worry in vtol?
plagiarised maps?
has that happened before?

Ok. Would you need the VTS only then, or the whole folder structure?
I assume you have the map
Easiest way to share it is to stick it up on the workshop

how hard is it to make mission sin this game? I have some pretty cool ideas
I recently joined, and a made a 2-part mission in just a day. The UI is really intuitive.
Things all follow a logical flow, and you can make something playable very quickly

where do I access the mission maker? in game or in a special menue?
in game
theres a button on ur monitor, but i think you can also open it in vr

Hi all, I have a question if anyone has may have struggled with my same issue. I am having problem with sound loudness. So I record little clips in audicity and they sound fine through VLC or Windows Media (like they are loud enough) but when I got to play them in the game the noise is so quiet I can barely hear my words. Has anyone else seen this before? I have tried recording them thinking I did something wrong. Exported as OGG.
I am not hearing my intro clip and I am not sure if it is because with all the other game sounds I simply cannot hear when I started my mission or my trigger isn't firing. Having a hard time deducing which one it is at the moment. Thanks for any advice you might have.
It might be a steam vr issue

wait are you saying your playing audio clips through the game?
im confused
just my index during testing of my campaign

So you guys made a mod for this game then?
its not out yet
but there are a few other mods yeah

you guys do other games? normal stuff or VR stuff?
we only work together on vtol
maybe move to modding

I do have a question about unit management if someone might have an answer. I have Echo group of four planes supposed to be following my group (Sierra) to the objective but when the mission starts they just fly off path and go in circles. What did I do wrong?
Thought it would be as easy as make a path, tell plane group to follow that path to a large group of enemies and then engage enemies will kick in...was my thought...and hope.
You might need to use an event that starts at mission start to get them to follow the path. The initial stuff in the unit options is a little janky

When I try to upload my mission to Steam, it goes to 10% and then say Generic Failure. Any ideas what might be causing this?
too big of a mission maybe?
try uploading a small one

too big of a mission maybe?
try uploading a small one
then updating it to a big one

What other assets does it use? Sound files? Images in the briefing?
I have one image for the briefing and one as the mission thumbnail. Neither are very high-res or anything.
How big are they, file-size-wise?

How big are they, file-size-wise?
If you post the game log, there might be something in it that gives a hint why it’s failing
a few hundred kliobytes only

is that the player.log shortcut in the VTOL VR folder?
That should be fine. You get several megabytes
Is the file the shortcut points to

Did you have mods loaded when you created it?
I believe I might have had the Nuke mod loaded for testing, not 100% sure tho
Actually no, now that I think back to it, I'm pretty sure I had it loaded

Yeah, agreed, tht does seem like a likely cause. Any ideas how I might fix this?
@Ketkev wrt yesterday’s stifled rant, ^
Not a clue. I’ve no idea what oddness the mod has put in the mission file

Hi all, may I ask those here willing to help...to help? I want to make an awesome campaign to play, something big like 8 to 12 missions. Anyway, I am not a game developer and have never tried anything like this before. I just added a new campaign "The Shlabovian Conflict" with the intro mission so I can learn. Would anyone be willing to play it and give me feedback?
I want to know how big (and by big I mean grandiose in terms action and objects) and want to know how big is too big? Also what is too easy and conversely what is too hard? So before I go to the masses or design multiple missions I thought I might try to get a handle on these things...even if just a little.
Thanks for any support you are willing to give in helping me make an awesome campaign for the community to play.

So I am not sure what happened in your game but when I downloaded it from steam and tried it, it worked as it did in testing. Mission launch, greeted by some audio, fly towards air base (see dog fighting going on), echo and kilo kill enemies over air base, 8 incoming bogies arrive and more dog fighting ensues, Overload warns about 16 more incoming fighters (at this point combat usually shifts towards the city in the direction the enemy came from as well as the river and ravine running through the middle of the island) which cues up some epic music...more dog fighting, upon victory...message from actual and RTB (required to land at base (though I think I need to specifically set a way point or something that shows the player to return to the base on the map)). So seems to work as expected for me. Maybe your download got messed up somehow?
probably a problem on my side then

Hey dude, tried your campaign just now. Just the one mission for now, right? Nice map, straight in the action, and nice to see wingmen ready to go too. I found the briefing audio was a little quiet and hard to hear - same with some of the custom radio messages you recorded. Also I found that I loaded probably the wrong setup (I'm a noob) so I had a few AAM all used up quickly but also a few AGM which I then didn't use. Ended up reverting to cannon sparingly. Still, completed and good fun.
Was cool to land at the base to see it pretty destroyed - looks like it took a beating

Makes me want to add radio and music to my mission. Or, better yet, convert to a campaign

I think it's a good idea - however what is your aim of these videos? Who's your target audience? Other people who are new to VTEdit and need help learning about it, or do you want to tell a story of your own development?
I really like your mission though. It's made me want to expand on mine and make a campaign, adding some story, music, and perhaps some voice acting by @Quantify  😉
Hah, I'll take you up on that offer

"Right listen in chaps. We have multiple baddies coming from the north, and a few naughty bandits from the south. We need to... Pay attention Johnson. You're not sitting the pub in your slippers eating knickknacks any more. Anyway, eyes forward.

Good show, well tally-ho chaps, chocks away!"

Heyy mates, I'm creating missions atm, but how do you set player spawns, I can set one, but my friends spawn in the same place, how do you set spawns for player 2,3 etc?
PD: I'm not sure if this is the correct place, sorry if it isn't
you cant i think

Ahhhh I don't know how to do that (the play list thing...not really a youtuber...could you help?) and greeat point. I will add video numbers to the title.
Hey I really appreciate all the feedback. I am really trying to do the community a solid here. I am cranking out more of these bad boys as we speak. Just finished timed events.
I don't make youtube videos but have seen many authors have a variety of different playlists on their channel, for different themes/subjects etc. Then each playlist is ordered

hey, I'll hit y'all up for the shlabovian conflict if you are interested, more the merrier right?
oh yes!
what's the issue?

Also, thought/question about an idea. A community campaign? Something checked into git hub that multiple people contribute to? Or we have one person make each mission? Then we call it VTOL VR : Ace Combat...A Shared Experience (or like A Community Experience)
its dumb. its dumb right?
I'm quite new to this but I think the technology doesn't allow that. Missions are attached to your steam account and uploaded to the workshop from that, so I'm not sure you could "commit" code into github, then somehow "update" in the workshop

Is there a way to launch the game into the mission editor?
Just start the game from the Steam library and use the mouse to click the mission editor button in your desktop window.
Ahh thankyou

The third part of the mission (no spoilers) my wingmen seemed to stay behind. That intended?
they are told to flee as well so not sure what is happening there
They stayed engaged from what I could make out on the radar screen

Can you manually trigger all wingmen to disengage and form up on player?
yes
That way, if I don't flee fast enough, my wingmen are stuck with me and die

How are people adding flares/smoke/markers to the missions? I've seen loads before but in the mission editor I can't seem to find any
I'm trying to visually mark waypoints
add an event

Is it the best way? I just want fixed colour flares on the map
best/simplest
there is no other way to spawn flares

why would you want in feet?
everything in the editor is in metric BTW
because, europe, and stuff.

I think only Russia uses Metres?
I meant non-aviation related
Even flying in the US i seem to recall we all used FT

isn't russia switching to feet qnh too?
they are

Is there a way to edit the mission that come with the game? I want to do a Coop version of stealth strike.
you can steal them from the game files and dump them into your editor files
where can I find them I the game files?

where can I find them I the game files?
not sure to be honest
looked through the files, cant find them :/

When in development of a mission, you're often back and forth between mission editor on the pc, and headset ingame. If enabled, you will start at the loadout screen. Is there any other way to start at the Brief screen instead? We can only really see the briefing screen once uploaded to Steam
If you save the mission and go into VTOL normally, it will be in Editor Missions iirc
sorry Custom Missions

Are you DCS'ing or VTOL'ing tonight?
Not tonight I'm afraid, pretty late and I'm not feeling great.
No probs - no rush on the settings file at all. I won't be on it for a couple of days

Are you thinking about buying any modules?
Because otherwise the A-4E Skyhawk is a good dogfighter (free module)
Oh, not sure. DCS hasn't been running too smoothly for me, so I've been in VTOL and mission editing

Could I please ask for some advice/assistance. Had to uninstall and re-install VTOL VR due to an audio glitch and I have lost access to edit the two missions I recently created and uploaded to Steam Workshop (Fighter Pilot ZX Spectrum Mission and Black Buck One - Falklands) Is there some way of being able to retrieve my mission editor files? 🙏
No

Oh i see.   What i did for kill box is make every actual objective not required. However, upon completion of each objective, it adds 1 to "win" global value. The master required objective (provide cas in this case) completed once "win" global value = 5.    I would make do something similar here. It wont matter which objectives are completed or in what order.    If you dont want to make multiple objectives and dont need waypoints, you can bake the selection into condtional success argument using ANDs and ORs + global value linked to which spawn like so:  In the action that spawns group A, also set a global value "spawn" to 1. If spawn group B, set gv to 2. C, 3 etc.  In excel formula format, the success conditional logic would look like this OR(AND(A=dead,gv=1),AND(B=dead,gv=2),AND(C=dead,gv=3))  Also, always be sure to trigger the objective AFTER the spawn and gv actions are fired. (Sometimes i use a 1s timed event as a standoff)

Great thank you so much for the advice. 👍 I was not familiar with the whole global values concept but will try some experimentation with them. I did think that having so many objectives was the problem so will try a new approach. One other quick question.... I have downloaded a map from the workshop and am using for a campaign in compiling. I have renamed all the bases in my editor but in the game the comms base names revert to the original map names. Do you know if this can be fixed or am I stuck with the original names?
Just wondered if you would consider making a basic tutorial on using global values in the VTOL editor some time. I am not from a programming background so don't really get the concept of how they can be used. From what I understand though they could be another very useful tool in mission creation? Just some basic concepts would be great.
Yeah, absolutely. I can make one today...later on of course after work. I'd be glad to help.

Quick question, did you rename the bases before or after you referenced the map in your campaign? If you referenced it first, then changed the names, you have to update the map your campaign uses. This can be corrected by updating the map under C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\[name of campaign]\[name of mission]\[name of map directory] and in that directory you will see your map and some different height maps associated to it.Then you'll see the [mapname].vtm, this is the file with the base names in it. You could also probably just change them in that file in a text editor but be mindful of editing game files outside the game editor (you can more than likely break it).
For my Shlabovian Conflict map, this is my folder with the same data
and my path to MY file is this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\The Shlabovian Conflict\Outer Shlabovia - Summer Isle

I also just released two scenarios the first, Mt Everest FF, is just a free flight map of the mountain and it's surrounding area. Some of the highest peaks are marked as objective waypoints, so I gues it's also kinda educational. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385398 The second on is called Nuke the City, and as you might guess, you nuke a city. This naturally requires the Nuke mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385398
If anyone wants to test them out, please do!
Feedback is welcome.

did you make them public?
I did. The links don't seem to be working, but you can just search "Mount Everest Free Flight" and "Nuke the City" on the workshop I guess
You missed the "4" at the end of the link

I hope you like it. here it is, this time with a working link https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385398925

Does anyone have any ideas why my BGM music won't work in the mission editor. When I click the speaker to test the audio there is no sound and no music starts in the game when it is supposed to. I have custom radio messages working fine. I have tried MP3 and OGG files, short music clips, long music clips, nothing works. I uploaded some of the tracks into the main game audio files and can play them using the in built player so cannot understand why the mission editor won't play them?

Hmm, odd. Mine worked just fine. Simple MP3 file plays when you test it with the speaker icon. Is the file in the EditorResources folder?
@Judge_dredd Have you tried using a different file that you know plays, as the BGM? Like any other file (like your radio messages), just set as BGM as a test. If it works, it suggests there's an issue with the music MP3 file you're trying to use

Seems a bit odd that they would play in the music player but not in the editor. I can't imagine it having to different mechanisms for managing audio files. So it seems really weird for it to work in one but not the other. But I have never run into the issue before. I had an issue when trying to reference OGG files but that went away as soon as I started using MP3's.

The bug I found was when referencing an audio file...some times it break the save feature of the mission editor. Like I reference my MP3 audio file and when I go to save the mission nothing happens...it just sits there. I can't hit crtl + s either. Not sure why referencing an audio breaks saving but for me...this happens semi frequently. So I have adapted to setup my event the way I want it, save my mission, then try to reference the audio file. If it breaks, fully exit the game back to desktop and load back in.

is there a way to use downloaded  maps for custom missions?
Of course, once a map has been downloaded it should show up as an available map when starting the scenario or campaign
There could be a bug in the game regarding filename. Try shorting the filename and remove any spaces, symbols, etc. Just in case @Judge_dredd

Question: I'm running the public test branch. Do my uploaded missions only work on the same branch, or are they available to all?

When making a mission, do you have any rules regarding copyright and using of other brand names - like Coca Cola Valley Run / Microsoft Defender / BMW Factory Berlin Tour (just random examples) ?

Jammo was asking if it would land the developer in hot water, but the content is hosted by Steam isn't it?
Yeah
I'd be careful with it but it's a bit of a legal grey area in terms of what exactly you can use everything for. Since it's your own content I don't know why it'd be shifted to the dev since Steam is responsible for the content they host

So fair use doesn't apply to the above use anyway?
well, let me rephrase
the logos are covered by trademark and copyright law trademark doesn't have a fair use exemption because trademark protection is inherently limited to business uses -- it's for designating products copyright is more broad, but nonetheless has a fair use exemption carved out

With global vars in the mission editor, you can edit the numbers/variable counters, but are there any ways to make Timers?
There's the main mission timer, where you see the finish time, but it would be good to be able to have a custom timer that I can start/stop and edit too, like adding time to it
Not without wanting to die

Bear in mind, it'd be a series of several hundred steps, each waiting for 1 second, each incrementing a counter or something by 1, then... doing something with the counter afterwards? Horrible
ergh
maybe not then!

Plus a second question (2-for-1 special today): If a unit has multiple events/triggers/actions etc, is there a way to spawn an instance of this object (Object Oriented) so each class will inherit the same types/events/etc ?
No
Far less bodging room there

Anyone know of existing missions where enemy aircraft start out at a long distance?
Hey everyone! I'm making a fully voice-acted campaign for VTOL VR! Come check it out here:  https://discord.gg/tY4FH92rpJ
Damn I hate the sheer logic of the mission editor sometimes 😡

You hate boolean logic or how the VTEditor works?
Boolean logic!  it’s just too damn precise. You spend 2 hours putting together a complex mission, you’ve checked it thru several times. Then you launch and at first way point ‘mission complete’  .... i didn’t even get to shoot anything down  🥲 I know I only have myself to blame 🙄
Beautiful

What would you do with it? Apart from the one niche race/time trial case, I can't think of anything that couldn't be done with timer events
I have uploaded mission 2 of the Artemis campaign. Only 4 more missions to code 😰 ... currently 288 (random) mission objective combinations for missions 1 and 2.
still need somebody who natively speaks english to help me voice a campaign, its about 8 missions long and i could really use your help

Is there a way to make units engage only the ones you want? If I set them to do not engage then I set a designated target will they engage that?
You can set non-targets, and priority targets. If they’re not a non-target, they’re fair game, but they’ll go for priority targets first if they can see them. They’ll never attack non-targets
I see.

Is there a way to make an AI A/V-42C Hover at a certain point?
No
that sucks

are you flying the ASF towards the point towards where you expect the F45 to be?
using like, an orbit at waypoint command i think its called
Thing is, there’s no real way to know where the friendly wing is going to be, and waypoints can’t move to follow planes (afaik)

Wait, dumb question, but I expected RCS modeling to a swerling case 1 monostatic value. Is it actually modeled by angle and frequency?

Interesting! Thank you!

Hello! I was looking to setup a mission (on the F-26) that starts on a carrier, and I'd like to place the plane ready for takeoff, much like in the very first Over-G Fighters mission (gameplay starts at timestamp of video). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjlW1ptHPRk&t=60s Is it possible (yet)? The mission editor apparently only lets me place the player in parking spaces, and I'd like the mission to start with the plane flight-ready (which is simple) and ready to takeoff (having to just lower the launch bar could also work). By all means, tell me if I'm being a dummy and missing obvious buttons.
No
it is impossible to spawn the player on the deck or flying at 0 kn

Mh, thanks, I'll set it up so it's the closest parking to the cat - what is the default catapult, by the way?
default?
I don't see what you mean by default catapult

now that i think about it, are there any other missions with the independence day units on the workshop?
im pretty sure you can just modify the mission file to have the name of the J4 fighter instead of some asf aircraft to spawn it
If I have a group set to spawn due to a trigger but every unit in said group is **NOT** set to spawn immediately (as in they will not be active/spawned in the world on scenario start), will they still spawn just fine or must I have atleast **ONE** unit in the group active when the trigger is called for the rest to spawn?

If I understand you correctly, they'll spawn just fine
exkuse me guys how do make spawn mision edit

The mission is Complete when the last active objective is completed. What objectives do you have at the moment?
Hello, guys! I am currently planning my first mission, and I am wondering if there was a conditional to force the player's radar off
i mean, you could probably fail them if they turn it on i guess

Does anybody have any solutions or ideas?
It is not possible to force the radar off
If i place an aircraft carrier

how do i make it the player spawnpoint?
Place the player spawn on it :p
units - player iirc

i believe if you click on the carrier and go to its settings you can set it there?
i may be wrong, it has been a while
oh yes ur right

does navigate to waypoint with the aircraft carrier make it park at the waypoint have automatic collision avoidance?
i cannot remember, i am sorry
it should park at the wpt

do you know what these options mean?
force detected - visible to units no matter what
force undetected is ditto

Is there a way to see the radius??
like so that i can see the sphere
Force Detected has no effect on allies. Force Undetected has no effect on enemies

Force Undetected is for if you want a friendly unit to not appear on the Nav map till you detect them, like the lost pilot on The Island: Redirection(?)
Ships have no path finding or collisions. They will happily sail underground
How can i force an aircraft carrier landing on an aircraft carrier that has landed?

How can i force an aircraft carrier landing on an aircraft carrier that has landed?
like an objective
bc in my scenario the aircraft carrier moves

Not sure what you mean. Whilst playing the mission? No. In the editor, the radius often appears when adjusting it in the objective
I'm not going to say it always appears, but you'll see a coloured circle around the chosen waypoint whilst moving the slider
I've found the same, where adjusting the radius doesn't show the radius. Would be useful to see this

Also since my scenario is multiplayer, will an aircraft carrier spawn work? because i heard someone say me and my friend will spawn in each other
*shrug* Sounds like a #modding thing
I mean its kinda both

So when making a mission, is there any way to add custom voice lines to play at triggers or something?
Yup. Look in the System actions
Awesome

does that mean all the other objectives have to be completed?
Could someone explain how the start mode final works?
I think it triggers if all the other objectives are resolved, but I’m not sure if they need to be completed successfully or not

Could someone explain how the start mode final works?
I think it triggers if all the other objectives are resolved, but I’m not sure if they need to be completed successfully or not
because... it just didnt trigger and made my second to last objective have the popup with finish mission n stuff

How are you activating the second to last objective?
If at any point there’s not an active objective, the mission will complete
Even if of only for a single tick

Hey guys, i've noticed that if you restart a mission from the death screen, it doesn't appear to fully reset everything. Incoming fighters in my mission were where they were at when I died, and some events wouldn't trigger. Any Idea why?
I think it is because you crashed (plane) and you restarts your plane meaning you restart your mission
hey real quick when I try to upload a mission to the work shop it says I haven't accepted the workshop agreement... Even though I have. Anyone else had this?

hey real quick when I try to upload a mission to the work shop it says I haven't accepted the workshop agreement... Even though I have. Anyone else had this?
oh my vtol crashed lol
try going on Steam Workshop and accepting the Steam EULA

Have you been able to upload stuff recently?
bro now it says it's timing out
what is happening

is there a way I can manually upload a mission?
this just ain't workin
@BahKooJ go to %appdata% -> boundless dynamics -> savedata -> gameSettings.cfg

anyone know the height of the carrier and the difference between true bearing and BRC?
for the second one in my measurements its 9 degrees
is there anyway to manually upload missions to the workshop?

Hi People, looking at events in mission editor. I get triggered events and get timed events, I look at Sequence Events and can't fathom what you get different to timed events. There's Entry Condition and Exit Condition but not sure what these do/how they work. Anybody explain difference between Timed and Sequence Events and how Entry/Exit behave in sequences?
sequence events are a list of actions that will be triggered in order

the entry condition is all of the conditions required to be fullfilled for the specific event to start, and the exit is the same, but for the event to end and go to the next start condition

I'm having a problem with the "Take Off" command for an NPC AV-42C.  I have a long event sequence with several roof top landings and take-offs to simulate a troop assault on a building.  The first two times I use the "Take Off" command the AV-42C does a vertical take off.  But for some reason the last I use the "Take Off" command the AV-42C attempts a conventional take off from the roof, which doesn't work out well.  Is there a way to force the NPC to take off vertically?
it should automatically take off vertically if not at an airbase
thats probably a bug

Always a full load of passengers?
I reduced it to 3 passengers.  Was 5.  But fewer passengers didn't change the outcome.
It seems to be rotating the nacels way to soon.  Sometimes it starts with them vertical but I have watched them rotate to horizontal while its at full AB but before the wheels have left the ground.

is there anything that could potentially be "above" the aircraft?
Sequence is 9 nodes long.  Maybe 15 actions.  This is the last one.
by which i mean, structures

How do I do that in the editor?
It’s automatic when you gets a new objective
Huh

How do I get rid of the waypoint when the destroy interceptor objective activates?
In the new objective auto select a new waypoint. If  the previous waypoint was a gps point I think the player has to clear it manually
@Brady  In your Objective Editor: - Objective Type: Destroy - Start Mode: PreReqs (I use this to ensure all previous objectives are done first -> "This Objective has *prereq*uisites") - Waypoint (You can set a location, or allied/enemy unit) - Auto-Set Qaypoint: TICK this so your nav screen and HUD will guide you to the right area - Required: TICK

What if you don’t want the target waypointed? Or anything waypointed?
You could set nothing there? As long as you set the target in the right-hand menu (destroy these targets to complete objective)
And that gets rid of the current active waypoint for the player?

Ah I see the issue (I'm a bit slow today). So progressing onto the new objective, if no waypoint is set, it will keep the previous one?  - So this could be a feature request / bug, that when no waypoint is set, navigation and hud markers clear to *no* waypoint - Or you set a new waypoint which is indiciating the general area/vicinity for the objective. ("Fly to the north and finish off the enemy last seen around that area")

You can set "Waypoint: NONE" and perhaps if you "Autoset waypoint" too, this will clear the marker for the pilot

I'd have to check though

Perfect, that's good to know. So you set NONE and "auto-set waypoint " ?
yep

Anyone know how to get AI Aircraft to fly to a waypoint (preferably in formation with the flight lead or certain aircraft) below the hard deck of 1500?
Do planes have railpath? Because that sounds like a job for railpath
they dont have railpath, but they have path

Do planes have railpath? Because that sounds like a job for railpath
they dont have railpath, but they have path
i got the ai to fly through a tunnel before so uhh

Exactly. That list is empty for me. Is this a bug or is there a setting somewhere?
Do you have ASF 30s or ASF 33s already created?
I don't think  so.

Do you have ASF 30s or ASF 33s already created?
I don't think  so.
Should I have?

Also can a campaign include missions on multiple aircrafts? I want to include some objectives using anti-ship missiles using the F/A26B and some stealth missions using the F45A.
Campaigns are built for a specific aircraft, so no sadly.
Using the UI, no. I believe some people had some luck hacking the campaign files in a text editor, but I can't recommend it

hello, is there a tutorial somewhere for the conditional trigger system?
maybe even something about making stuff happen randomized
there is RNG, only for spawnpoints though

I guess it is not possible to restart a completed objective?
I kinda figured out how to "randomize" things, but I would have to do it in every completed objective again...
Nope. Pretty much everything is one-shot

but I need to do the "if then else" for 10 Objectives for every objective? there must be an easier way.... right?
nope
isnt there a way to "call" an event that does the "if then else" stuff? (the conditional action)

isnt there a way to "call" an event that does the "if then else" stuff? (the conditional action)
Sure. Once
It's not even going to be a pleasant if then else thing, because you've got to filter out the objectives that've already been done

Does anyone know some long fun (workshop) levels with the 45? im just tryna vibe for 1-2 hours
when a unit is set to cold start do they automatically start up once commanded to take-off?

Is there any way to make my joystick settings permanent when i load into the plane or for everytime i respawn? Having to change the joystick everytime i die or load in is really annoying...
joystick settings?
Also, this is #mission_editor

Is there an airport editor or something like that for the airports like there is with the aircraft carrier?  When my units are parked at an airport and I give the Take Off command, the AV-42 and F-45s always attempt a vertical take off.  I want to start them heavy and my F-45s are having a hard time getting off the ground.
If it is in the hangar or tent, it will horizontal take off.
If they’re too heavy to take off vertically, they’ll take off conventionally

Hey. I'm very new. I have a little question. Is there a way to start the mission editor without using the vrheadset?
Use the mouse to click the "Mission Editor" button in the desktop game window.
Oh, never saw this xD

Hey guys, i have one question, can someone explain me how the "fire conditional condition" works and quote one exemple of it? Not only the rng usage
In context?
Whatever context, because i guess i can use it instead of use some timed or triggered event but didnt mess with it yet

I mean where are you seeing it?
The mission editor is a big place, and I'm not sure what you're referring to
For exemple, if i Want To use only the if condition (if group tango is landed near waypoint because they are on a carrier in movement = new action is take off) Will it works? Or i have To put else if ou else

For exemple, if i Want To use only the if condition (if group tango is landed near waypoint because they are on a carrier in movement = new action is take off) Will it works? Or i have To put else if ou else
You mean "Fire Conditional Action", or is there a "Fire Conditional Condition" somewhere?
You don't need to fill in the else

You mean "Fire Conditional Action", or is there a "Fire Conditional Condition" somewhere?
You don't need to fill in the else
But you'll only be able to fire the action once, as you'll only be able to fire the event that fires it once

Yep sir, that the way i use it, with global value, so we cant use conditional condition To get the same result ?
You might be able to. I'm just not sure why you would
If you held a gun to my head and ordered me to do it, I'd put a Fire Conditional Action in the Complete actions of each of the three objectives, and each of those Fire Conditional Actions would be identical

Is there a limit to the number rearm/refuel points that can be active on a map?  I have multiple "rearm/refuel point A" spots on my map.  I landed at one, engines off and weapon arm off, but the rearm won't work.  Coms -> ground -> request rearm comes back with "negative, ground crew unavailable".
theres no limit other than like... you spawning 1 billion and it runs at 2fps
did you enable rearming in the mission settings?

did you enable rearming in the mission settings?
Maybe not.  How do I do that?  I was also running with Force Equips turned on, maybe that was the problem.
I unchecked "Force Equips" and I'll give that at try.  One more question, what's the "Bullseye" waypoint for?

Odd. Others have reported no issues.

No, that would display a message reading "Incompatible game version". I uploaded and created it on stable
Ah

I ran into this error when I tried to upload my campaign: Upload Error!  Limit exceeded!  Is there a way around this?  My campaign is 4 missions long.  I don't think it is excessive in any way but maybe I'm wrong.  I spent quite a long time working on it, embarrassed to say how long.  Hoping other players can fly it.
Never mind, looks like the problem was the images were to large.  I think I read somewhere they need to be under 2MB.  I shrank them down and the upload worked.  Give the campaign a try and let me know what you think:  The Canyon War by Hard_Reset (sirmac5 is my son's discord user name.  The accounts are all messed up in our house).

Campaigns/scenarios have a maximum size. It’s easy to blow through it with one carelessly unresized image

Hey  I used to know how to do this, but what was the key to cycle through ai units when you're in a mission? Want to observe my scripted units to see if they're doing what I want
While in-game or the editor?
in-game, you can use the Insert Camera, and as it's name indicates, is triggered by the "Insert" button on your keyboard

Is there a trick to setting up the oil rigs so that they can be destroyed by enemy units?  I am trying to set up a protect objective for the player to protect the oil rigs, but can't figure out how to get the enemy units to target the rigs.  Thanks.
A janky way of doing it would be adding a bunker or two on top of it, and if it destroyed, the rig falls
@sirmac5 you can use the bomb waypoint command potentially

Hey, so when making a mission to be used with the multiplayer mod, is there anything in particular that needs to be done? Where do the additional players spawn in (do I just need to make sure there are enough spots or smthn)?
they spawn at airbases/carriers
So I just need to make sure there is a spare slot on a carrier?

So I just need to make sure there is a spare slot on a carrier?
i mean, im pretty sure the mod will spawn you inside an AI even if there isnt :Kek:
Hah nice. Thanks!

I have a question when you create a mission with combat operations how do you balance the enemy to the ally... I mean do you have an ally, one enemy jet or an ally against two enemy jets... ?
Play testing
I personally err on the side of easy, but it’s entirely up to you

Hey, trying to figure this out myself and I think the answer is no, but is there a way to trigger an event multiple times? Like could I have an event trigger every time the player is in proximity to a way point, and if the player enters and exits the radius it would retrigger if they reenter. So far I haven't been able to get it to work but thought I'd ask.
Trying to make SAM radars turn on and off based on proximity
not really

I have a question, so I'm trying to make my wing men takeoff with me at the beginning of the missions, I set the "start action" on my Takeoff objective to command the Unit Group to takeoff and it seems to work just (the lights and engines turn on) however instead of taking off from the airbase I have them parked at, they instead perform vertical takeoffs which take forever. How do I get them to takeoff from the runway?
they also fail spectacular and end up flipping over beacause of all the weapons they carry which is pretty funny to watch
nvm it turns out they have to be inside the tent not in on the assphault outside the tent

Hello just wanted to express my thanks to Baha for this game. I luckily stumbled across it after buying a VR setup and PC for microsoft flight simulator but now have far more hours on VTOL!   Please keep doing what you're doing, wishing you continued success.  I am now starting to experiment with the mission editor which is a great feature, I wondered is there anywhere that shows the ranges of the various radars and missiles (specifically I am looking to compare the different surface to air missiles)?  I couldn't find this info online but wondered if it was visible in a config file or something.    Secondly will it ever be possible to program allied aircraft or ships to launch cruise missiles against targets?  I couldn't find a way to equip it in the loadouts and looks like others have found the same.  Thanks!
allied aircraft can launch the cruise missiles to follow a gps route in a scripted event
i believe its only one of the cruise missiles tho

Can anyone explain to me how to get enemy tanks to move on the mission editor?
you can make paths for AI to follow, and then select the select tanks to follow that path
I don't really know how to explain it but it got something to do with paths

does anyone know how to change the measurement to nautical miles? I don't know meters very well lol
american type beat, ya know
...oh and can I change the alt to feet?

...oh and can I change the alt to feet?
I literally just spent the past two hours making a mission and my VTOL crashed
and saved

what happens if you command a non-vtol aircraft to take off and they are nowhere near an airbase?
im hoping they just try to take off in the direction they are facing
but i highly doubt it

I don't remember but isn't a mission somewhere in the game in vtol to land on a sort of road somewhere?
For like a sort of FARP I think?
I don't remember a mission like that, but with the AV you have to land in a field once and with the 45 you have to land at a small FOB

For like a sort of FARP I think?
I don't remember a mission like that, but with the AV you have to land in a field once and with the 45 you have to land at a small FOB
One of the f45s mission has you land at a farp. But that is only the player, not the AI

When its like this, the next objective starts at the same time as the radio message when the objective is completed. Any suggestions on how to create a delay?
nvm I figured it out
For future knowledge-seekers, you'll need to measure the length of your audio, and start the objective on a delay. Actions are non-blocking, and all action in the same trigger happen one after another on the same tick

Is there a way to force an AI controlled av42c to take off horizontally instead of vertically?
start it in a hanger, or somthing else obstructing it vertically
or give it a loadout that makes its TWR < 1

Would anyone know anything about radio transmissions? I'm trying to get them to play one after another but they either A. Cut each other off or B. Don't play at all
You’re either going to have to play all sounds in sequence in one transition, or play them all in an event sequence, where each one has a time delay
I'll give it a go in a bit. Thanks :greatstory:

Does anybody know how to get the troops to dismount the aircraft after it lands at a certain point?
I've never tried it, but its probably under units/AV42C in question/unload passengers
@Dinner Plate I'm sorry I should have been more clear. I have the AV42 as an AI aircraft part of a scenario that is off loading troops. It lands at the designated spot, but only one troop gets out and he just stands there lol

try selecting all of the individual units?
This is what I use for my AI dropoff in Securing Fjorway: Foothold, the best selling AV-42 campaign, available from all good Steam Workshops
The important point is that there's a Rally waypoint set, and I'm not immediately telling the AI plane to take off again

Question about Campaigns and Steam Workshop:  If I publish with just one mission (for feedback, etc) and then I add more missions and publish again, will everyone get the new missions automagically?
Missions and campaigns are two different things
You'd have to publish a campaign containing one mission

I'm really enjoying creating and testing missions.  I had a situation yesterday where after I refueled, enemy air craft just disappeared.  I'm assuming if I use the Objective type of "Refuel" and then start another Objective that spawns enemies afterward, that would fix it?
Enemy aircraft shouldn't just disappear. If you've got a mission where you can reproduce that, drop it in #public_testing for baha to fix
The disappearance was when the Objective type was Land - I don't know if that makes a difference to you.  I'll test again tonight.

And refueling/rearm stations should also not effect AI?
Assuming you mean the FARP structure things you can place down, they should not affect the AI
It was when I chose to refuel that the current Objective finished and I got the message in my left hand.  Then it went to the rearm/refuel screen and when I came back to the cockpit the AI aircraft was gone.

I assume "the message in my left hand" is the mission complete screen?
Yes
The objective complete requirement is the destruction of the AI aircraft

anyone know if I can make infantry units walk right into a bunker (so basically through the walls, since there are no usable doors afaik) using a path, and if yes, will they die if that bunker is destroyed?
Yes and probably. Paths let you do what ever you want, if you want to get sufficiently fiddly Land units don't block each other in any way. Bunkers require large weapons to die, and anything that can kill a bunker would also kill infantry nearby.
you might as well just remove the infantry once they are inside tho

so i'm completely new to VTOL VR editing, should I drop my link here to get tested and get feedback on?
You certainly can

Any pointers on paths for ground vehicles?  Do the path points need to be on the ground or within a certain distance of the ground?  Do vehicles have a maximum incline they can traverse?
there are literally no limitations
vehicles can fly using paths

Do they have to be very near the first point in the path?
I'm having trouble getting some tanks going along a path, I'll keep playing with it.
Thanks

sorry im back from birthday celebration :)) im glad you enjoyed it and now im thinking of what things i could do to make it a bit more interesting.. more things flying around? more difficult??

if I simulatenously tell a parked AI aircraft to take off and to do some other task, eg to attack a certain target, will the take off and then immediately go to doing that other task, or will it just bug out?
i believe if you tell them to do somthing that requires them to be flying, they will automatically take off
but i may be mistaken

has an update to mission editor occurred? and busted it. editor no longer responds to mouse clicks/scroll wheel. Similar in map editor. list boxes spilt over box edges
You stable or public_testing?
Reproduced in public_testing

There is a ground unit behavior called "follow".  How is that used?  I don't see a place to define something to follow.
Also, is there a random despawn mechanism for ground units if the player is far away?
And by despawn, I mean the unit will spontaneously get destroyed.

no

I've used Path because it has you set the path that you want the unit to follow.  If I set the behavior to Follow, it seems like I would select another unit to follow but I don't see that.  Maybe this is a future thing?
I suspect Follow makes the unit follow another unit in the same group in formation
Just checking now

How can I view triggers visually in the mission editor?

I've made a quick tutorial for the F/A-26B as I felt that the default in-game ones were a bit... lacking.

Is there limit to how many units can be in the mission at any given time? I have some units placed but the do not show up when testing the mission
there is no hard limit

I've had random unit spawing issues as well.  I've found spawning them later fixes the issue. (spawning with timed event or proximity, etc)
Is there a way to run a mission from the editor in some form of freecam mode without having to go into VR so you can make sure the units are doing what they're supposed to etc?

push insert when you load into the aircraft
then i think its [] to switch aircraft

is it really that time again?
Just a straight timer? Would that even be useful?
idk i use the time sequence a lot for making mission.

i've often pondered time delays in mission editor. As an objective type you could have player wait. But i think better if the Trigger event actions (which fire all at once, when event is triggered) had time delays on them like Timed event actions. This would provide more flexibility. as it is I find a use a trigger event to fire a timed event to get a delay - seems cumbersone.   As Skumby says access to a game timer - starts at zero and counts time (say in seconds), then use conditionals to test timer value ... timer > 100, timer between 200 and 300 etc. and trigger events Conditional editor already exists, just need a timer.  with globals can do durations too  @BahamutoD suggestion for an easy add for a future release?

Russia must think I’m gonna invade or something

So I've got two opposing naval forces with carriers. They're both far from their waypoints. I've noticed there's no command like "navigate to unit/unit group" How should I get the aircraft to navigate to the other naval force wherever it is on the map and have them be free to engage the other side's aircraft?
set them to engage enemies
and set a path that interesects or stops them nearby (10-25km id say)

if you can't see the whites of the other navy's eyes is it even naval warfare?
exactly
if you're into that then sure

Problem: this fighter just sits there rather than taking off. It's got a command to take off. What might be the problem?
I've re-checked the logic of the mission. Is it that F-45s just can't take off horizontally from that position?
I think that might've been it. Swapped their starting locations with a couple of Kestrels and it's all working fine now

Nope, now it's happening with the fighters at the rear. Would appreciate advice

time for a dumb question! How do objectives fail? EG If have objective to fly to waypoint XXX, objective completes (successfully) when player is close to XXX. so objective is 'live' until player arrives. OR is it that scenario needs some other event to explicitly fail the objective (under whatever condition that tirggers the event)?
Well normally what you would do to fail an objective you would first create a trigger, timed, sequence event and select the action within it and select objective and click on the objective and fail it. But I have a feeling that you are trying to ask something else.
@Red Elite no not asking something else. was just looking at objective and registering (the obvious) how it completes successfully, but that made me think where's condition for fail. Its not in objective! So realised it must be elsewhere viz choose action to fail object in a separate trigger, timed, sequence event. Thks for confirming

What is the best way to put a KC tanker in the air for refueling practice? I tried placing one in the editor in the air with decent enough height (I THINK) and speed but it seems to just crash straight down into the water. Can this be done or does it have to start from an airbase and takeoff?
Send a picture of the stats of the aircraft in the editor
Not near the computer right now. Is there something particular you are looking for?

Not near the computer right now. Is there something particular you are looking for?
Maybe, I have never heard of it literally falling out of the sky, but you might have not done something properly
Ah, wait, I have it following a path!! Is path maybe only for naval and/or ground units? Perhaps it dove down to the path. Its hard to debug things while mission editing cause there is no way to spectate things.

Or at least not easily
Paths can be followed by anything

Is the altitude for the path set properly?
Remember that a path overrides the altitude
which is how you can make units fly when they are not supposed to (RailPath)

Oh, what is a path really for?
it will aim for ASL 0
Maybe I'm using it incorrectly.

On a new event there is a "start immediately" or something but then a timer value. So is that like trigger at mission start plus x seconds?
No
start immediately starts the event as soon as the mission loads

Ok, then what is the timer on the actions? Is that between each action or something?
And is it before the first action or after the first action?
The timer is independent for each event

And is it before the first action or after the first action?
The timer is independent for each event
it is relative to the load of the mission

Does anyone have a good explanation of how to put a tanker into a nice orbit for refueling? I used an orbit point but that didn’t work out too well plus the tanker did not adhere to the speeds I put in.
I’d have it orbit a waypoint, but with a really huge radius so you’re not having to pull 3G just to hook up
The speeds in the editor are all in m/s, so you’ll have to do conversion if you’re used to thinking in knots

Do you know of a good radius?
Nope. You’ll need to play with it to find a decent value
Thanks, will play around!!

Have you tried just reattaching them to the carrier again?

Does anybody have any insight to why I'm suddenly unable to upload an image to scenario description on the edit tab? The file is 800 kb which is an appropriate size and a PNG file. I haven't had any issues before, and just out of nowhere it won't save the image after I upload it.
Post the player.log file. There’s a shortcut to it in the VtolVR program directory
@Skumby

Can you restart the game, try to to change the image, then quit, and post the log, so there's less other stuff to sift through?
Ive tried that many times...including resizing and using an entirely different image and format
did you modify the file directly via notepad or something?

did you modify the file directly via notepad or something?
Oh i see what youre saying, standby

are you telling the ai to bomb a waypoint without assigned a waypoint?

Regarding "Form on Pilot": I used this to have an AI pilot (wingman) form up on another AI pilot (leader).  Later in the mission I tell the wingman to go orbit a waypoint and I send the flight leader elsewhere.  The wingman does neither and just kinda flys around.  I've tried also setting the Form on Pilot to none but I get the same behavior.  Thoughts?
Is there a way to influence future missions in campaigns? For example if a carrier is sunk in the present mission it does not get put into the next mission?

hey quick question in for the mission editor, what is detection mode?
it says whether you need to see/look a unit to know where it is, or its just always shown on your nav map
i think theres a third option, dont remember

How does that work with the shiny new detection code?
I don't think the new method handles the force modes yet
I'm struggling to get these 4 units to move along a path in a convoy. I set them down in the marked order in a line on the road, add them to a group and tell the group to navigate a path (via a Event), however the launchers pull to the side and the radar truck closes the gap.

What formation have you told them to use?
i haven't found such an option yet, i might be blind

Only the fa26 and example scenarios work

@BahamutoD above log - new radio knob breaking the game loading in some way? Mission editor stuff, followed by a load of multiplayer stuff
Long shot - if you're able to fly the fa-26 in other scenarios, try giving all the radio knobs a good twiddle, then exit the mission and try your mission editor scenario again
My theory is that their state is messed up in your pilot config, and changing it will hopefully fix it

how does one make aircrafts placed on carrier deck in editor take off in sequence when mission starts?
go to editor events
go to the carrier

Does anyone know if there's a way to use triggers or something to turn on and off various aircraft functions? For example, turn off engines from a waypoint proximity trigger?
I don't think you can tell aircraft to go cold mid-air
but you can use a trigger event for everything else

Building a scenario where I have 2 bombers taking off from airbase as player approaches for landing. Player requests ATC for landing and bombers go to crap. Player log says they're holding short of runway - what's seen is first bomber sitting on end of runway (not lined up for takeoff) , and other bomber sitting on grass adjacent to taxiway. Player lands and once clear of runway, first bomber taxi's across the grass and crashes into a hanger.   Take off events for bombers triggered by player proximity to airbase. I think player ATC request for landing is 'blocking' bombers taking off (conflict for runway).  Is there a way to force AI bombers take off to have priority  over player ATC request to land? Ie player gets told "can't land yet" or similar?
sadly i don't think you can change ATC Priority.
Which map's this on?

Maybe you can ask the player to request clearance if the second bomber is above 30 knots?
players always have priority unless the ai is already on aproach or on the runway
Skumby - my own map.  derbryler - nice suggestion but players are notoriously independent.  Overlord - I suspected as much, but you've got my solution. instead of having the ai parked on apron waiting for player approach, i'll park them on the runway just after player departs.  Thanks all

Is there a way to look at Workshop scenarios/campaigns in the editor?  Just want to learn about the different capabilities and honestly help beat a mission by understanding all the parameters.

You can't open up a scenario again. It spills the magic juice back into the air and mission won't work anymore

can you put people on boats?
I have confirmed, you cannot put people on boats
I've tried this too (put people on boats) ... it doesn't work. I wanted to have the 42C fly from land base to carrier, pick up people, and fly them to some where else. But you can't have people on boats. I tried taking people to boat and have them get out - they don't don't get out.  It all goes to what Bahamuto thinks the game is about - people on boats is a long way from flying!

I thought this was just about the editor thought?
Well I guess the more you know.
And no that doesn’t work some times. But I don’t want to get into it.

So, I'm new to this, and I wanted to figure out how to create a mission where the parameters were, you infiltrate a enemy-held airspace to sneak in and shoot down a bomber (In-universe holding a high-ranking official), that's escorted by 2 fighters. Is that doable and if so what are the steps?
First I would lay out the map you imagine. Then I would add the bomber with the escorts. You should put them in the same group and let them follow a Path you designate so you can decide if it flies close to your airspace or deep inside their own.
Then you should add SAM sites. With a radar and launchers on high positions. Then you have to decide if you want a wingman or go solo. And you need to add an Objective and set it to destroy, set the bomber as target. But I think you should do how you feel. Just add some things, play the mission and add stuff you felt was missing.

I'm looking to use a way point proximity trigger to spawn in an enemy aircraft, and each time you fly through the way point a craft will spawn so long as there are no enemy aircraft still alive. does anyone know a way to repeatedly spawn in aircraft like that without having to place tons of them, basically just using one asset to respawn it over and over again?
sadly i don't think you can do that.
There are custom missions where the bandit respawns when you fly to at least 9100m ASL so I think there may be some way to do it though

Alright, welp.. Do un-spawned units have a noticeable impact on performance while un-spawned? I'm about ready to put in this work lol
It does have some impact as far as I am aware
its negligible

Can trigger sequence nodes be activated repeatedly? Or do they just trigger once and they're done?  For example, I'd like to use the radio knob to set a global value based on it's volume output, 10% = 1, 20% = 2, etc. Then when global values equal a number and your landing lights value = 1, spawn a set type of craft based on it's corresponding global value. I can get the dial to set global values once, but then when I come back to those volume based values nothing seems to happen. Trying to make a volume knob selector switch that changes global values associated with different types of craft to spawn in using landing lights as the trigger to select your choice from the knob. Basically in plane ai spawn controls, but I'm not sure a trigger sequence will work the way I'd like it to. Any ideas on a work around, or if this is even possible?
triggers can only work once
nothing repeats

I also work with global values and so far I use seperate events. That means I have a buttload of triggers. Maybe you could set up multiple triggers and increase the value each time you activate it. So group one activates with global value 1, group two with global value 2 and so on?
That might just work, I'll see what I can come up with later today. Thanks for the help guys!
Once I upload a Campaign to the Workshop, if I need to make a change, how does that change get to the Workshop?

Once I upload a Campaign to the Workshop, if I need to make a change, how does that change get to the Workshop?
If I upload from the Mission Editor, it creates a separate version in the Workshop, which isn't what I want.
If I upload from the Campaign selection screen, it doesn't seem to update what's in the Workshop.

Wait do you mean public testing?
Yeah.  My install of VTOL VR was the public testing version and I created the Campaign in that version.  Then I reverted to the stable version and tried to update the Campaign.
oh yeah i highly suggest you don't do that because there is no frame rate limit for me so it just maxes out my GPU and CPU and i get like 1132+ fps.

No

Anyone know how to get units to follow each other in the editor?
I don’t believe you can
If they’re in the same group, they’ll move in formation, but that’s it

what does 'getting take off path async mean'?
sorry didn't mean to paste/post all this detail
Where did you place the bomber.

Does 9 have a path?
no. log seems to indicate  inbuilt path being used - 'AirbaseNavTaxiRoutine' just to complete description bombers are not spawned on apron, they're spawned on a taxi way and have separate event at start up to taxi to apron - this occurs OK. later another event triggers take off. I previously had taxi paths for bombers to take them onto runway with subsequent event to takeoff - same thing happened - didn't take off. I didn't check log previously to see what was happening.
So have you set the bombers as take off on default

how can i set a waypoint or path with my carriers? Image
You’ve not posted an image, so I’m going to use my imagination
Once you’ve created the path, the most reliable way to get units to file it is to create a Timed Event that Starts Immediately with an action for the unit/unit group to move to waypoint or follow path

how do you make an entire group do something?
I have a sea group that I want to move in circles
I'd probably use an event trigger sequence and add a ton of nodes that tell the ship group to go to the next waypoint in a circle of waypoints. the entry and exit conditions between actions being their proximity to the waypoints, and the event actions having the group always navigate to the next waypoint in the circle. do that over an over again until they circle as long as you need them to.

Question, I've made a path for this bomber to follow (For a mission where you're supposed to take down the bomber before they land), and don't see a way to get them to land from the path tools?
Or really, slow down or anything?
You need to use events to make them land. They will contact air traffic control to request landing. If there are unoccupied parking spots, they will be allowed to land and park.

Put a waypoint along the path at a reasonable distance from the airfield, then set up a triggered event, on the bomber’s proximity to the waypoint to give it the land action

How do I make a mission available to all planes?

I'm struggling to get MBTs to follow a path over a bridge.  Is there a secret to this?
Several of them will drop into the water below.
Ground units are completely free of path finding. The group leader will follow the path, and the rest will form up in formation around them

Regarding a ground unit being "detected": what does that mean and what are the mechanics for it?
is it shown on the navigation map
if its always discovered, you can always see it on the nav map, otherwise you have to get close enough or lock it to "discover" it

Can I begin an Objective, complete it, and then begin it again later?  This is via a triggered objective.  I might want to use the objective repeatedly in a mission.
Nope
Skumby - I've seen meanjeans' question multiple times. I can understand why you might not want to repeat an objective (given conditions around objectives, prerequisites etc). But the same answer applies to events - why can't an event be reused/retriggered, IE if there's something that allows event to be made active again. Things like trigger conditions can simply re-occur and the actions re-actioned if possible (same as when event is first triggered).   I guess I'm asking is there technical / Unity issue that prevents this or is it just Baha hasn't coded that way?  Just curious!

No technical reason. It's just the way it works currently
Having events and things repeating makes things more complicated than they need to be for the vast majority of situations

Ta! Doesn't seem more complicated to me (I'm a novice Unity user).  Simply 're-enable' event (ie make it available again), and if trigger conditions re-occur,  just redo actions. What am I missing?
The edge cases
The complications needed for the UI to make it usable

Can I have that play asset in some random spot on the map and as long as his spawn is set to the AC were good?
yes
setting the carrier spawn moves the player spawn to the deck

Heres another question, if another guy joins and spawns what happens to him?
like in mp?
Yes

Yo ⬆️  sort this man out
Meow has been sorted out. Thank you for your concern.

Is anyone aware of any co-op cas missions that are out there that would suit 2-3 players in A10's ?
kill box might be good
Yeah i've played that one before, just wondering if there might be any others :Thonk:

does anybody know why my mic commands wont work in custom missions? they work in all the dev made carrier practices but whenever I try and use them ingame it never works.
in game meaning in a custom mission^^ im talking about like requesting landing at carriers and such, hate having to use the MFD
What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?

What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?
Request landing/takeoff and calling the ball. I read the wiki so I know you have to preface it by saying the name of the carrier but still, only works in dev made missions. never works in my own customs.
What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?

What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?
"Aircraft Carrier Two, Requesting Landing"
Hull num is 2 name is Aircraft Carrier and its unit 0

is Aircraft Carrier Two the exact name?
or is it zero two?
I can double check but its just named Aircraft Carrier, the unit number assigned to it by the game is 0 and i changed the hull number to two

or is it zero two?
I can double check but its just named Aircraft Carrier, the unit number assigned to it by the game is 0 and i changed the hull number to two
you have to use the name of the airport

So try leaving off the two and just saying the rest?
Thank you btw
yessir

is there a way to put infantry on the flight deck to make it look more real? I saw SS's of someone in game with people running around the flight deck
Nope
That was a mod

how are MP missions made? would I need to set up other friendly aircraft for other players to control, or is only 1 player entity needed

As far as official multiplayer goes, no one knows, as it’s not possible yet
^, I assumed MP mod then

Question, is there a way to force F45s to land with wires on the carrier vs them landing vertically? Don't think so but just curios if anybody's found a way
They’ll land conventionally if they’re fat
Thank you

anybody know a way to make friendly/enemy icons disappear? referring to the red / blue indicators around units
can you change the detection.

yessir thats how you do it?

hey was wondering if it's possible to edit coop missions for the new mp?
Nope
ouf thanks

so in the mp mod could you have one player in the F-16 and one player in the A-10? also how do you create multiple spawns for players in the mp mod do you just put a couple player spawns or
yeah if you both have the mods loaded
sick ty ty

Thinking about trying to make a mission for a friend and I to play together (using the Multiplayer mod), are there any limitations to what you can in a singleplayer mission compared to making a mission for the multiplayer mod?
yes
objectives can only be completed by the host, unless its something like "kill x" or maybe going to a waypoint

How do you make player spawns for people other than the host?
you can't
Then how do other people spawn in?

Then how do other people spawn in?

Is there a way to force enemy planes to maintain a speed until they've done a bombing run? The idea is that a bomber squadron appears to attack the player's carrier and they must intercept and destroy them before they reach the carrier. But they're flying super fast so it's hard to catch them
And can you make them fly in formation until they spot any hostiles?
If you create the flight path of the enemies to fly in formation, but keep the engage enemies box checked in their settings then they will break off and engage once they detect you on radar

And can you make them fly in formation until they spot any hostiles?
If you create the flight path of the enemies to fly in formation, but keep the engage enemies box checked in their settings then they will break off and engage once they detect you on radar
Unless they’re incapable of engaging you, like a bomber

Do I have to path each one individually or will they fly formation on one path?
If you have them in a unit group, and tell the unit group to follow the path, they’ll move in formation
Awesome, cheers guys

This guy won't attack the F45 on the carrier deck (5km right in front of it). Anyone know why?
Set a timed event that starts immediately and tells him to attack it and for the F45 to take off as well
What weapons does the ASF33 have equipped?

What weapons does the ASF33 have equipped?
Standard, the twin cannon, short range heatseekers and medium radar guided
Is the carrier allowed to attack enemies?

Is the carrier allowed to attack enemies?
No, I want it to be kind of a cinematic start where a stray fighter kills the F45 onboard and then buzzes the carrier before retreating to it's base.  So I disable 'engage enemies' until 40s has passed

Hey guys quick question will the AI still use laser guided bombs if I don't equip them with a TGP or do I have to give them a TGP in order for them to use them?
I would hope they'd not use the bombs, but that's a neat edgecase
laser bombs can still be dumb fired i think, possibly the AI will use them as unguided bombs

can you make av42s land on a crashed unit? Like if i shoot down an enemy unit, can I force the av42s to land where the crash site is? kinda hard to predict where ill shoot it down at

can you make av42s land on a crashed unit? Like if i shoot down an enemy unit, can I force the av42s to land where the crash site is? kinda hard to predict where ill shoot it down at
or id set them to land at waypoint
you can set a waypoint on a unit, then set up action for AV42 to land at that waypoint when unit is destroyed. (It might right on top of crashed plane). However, waypoint might not survive once the crashed unit 'disappears'. it might survive when unit is destroyed. Idk what will happen - never tried it.

Don’t know if I should put this in mods or not, but when I try and make a mission for the a10 wart hog mod I click on the a10 plane after I load the mod but it says I’m still using the av-42c. Am I actually using the a-10 or no?
Just set it to the fa-26b for modded planes
No

Where do I find my campagins in my vtol vr files? I see custom scenairos, editor resources, n stuff
wait
actually nvm found it

Geez @Skumby  why so caustic? I'm  not being malcious or trying to mislead,  was just trying to help. I never said "Land at Wpt" objective worked as I suggested. While you're pointing out a deep subtlety between waypoints (1) and (2), both defining fixed waypoints or setting waypoint fields in events and relevant objectives, both  lead to (2) NAV lines and HUD icons, so to flight experience seem to be the same thing.   But agree with you " there is no way to make a (1) waypoint (defined in editor) follow a unit. They’re fixed points set in the editor "
 The join objective says "If the objective does not have a waypoint set, it will automatically be set to the [Target Unit]." which what I think Yoboy was looking for - a way to put a 'waypoint' (type 2 to be sure) on a unit. Similarly why I showed screenshot of proximity event, where the 'waypoint' can be set to a unit. The screenshot I used (of Join objective) is from a mission I have. Once objective is triggered the waypoint icon appears in HUD and follows target unit, and NAV green line appears.  Which confirms what you said "Some objectives can have their (2) waypoint set to a (1) waypoint or a unit in the mission editor".
ok
@YoBoy further on my suggestion of setting (I hestiate to use word) waypoint to the unit that going to crash. I tried it, the waypoint continues to exist after the  AI plane is shot and is going down, but disappears once the unit hits the ground and is destroyed .... so is not a solution to your problem. Sorry if i mislead you.

yeah
ok thx

is there any way to just spectate the mision and se waht the ai dose?
you can
how?

dose this work with enimy units?
it should i dont really use it that much
ok

Does av42 land and take off OK? Might be too heavy once troops are loaded - check TWR.  To drop troops you need to specify a rally waypoint near the landing site where they assemble once they dismount the aircraft.  Not had problems with pick up troops using 'board aircraft' event. got to specify in event which aircraft to board. I guess troops need to be near aircraft and selected aircraft is on the ground.
have specify which troops to pick up as well.
Screenshot your events

Unload troop command. Then remove waypoint then add a reset way point of path?
OwO A-10 ground strike mission uploaded with a new idea I had?

But

Are you referring to the sound of the gun firing after the rounds impact? Because if so the reason those are delayed is due to the speed of sound and because of that, the pilot would not hear staggered firing sounds
pilot doesn't hear that, the first sound you hear in videos taken from the ground are the rounds impacting, then the sound of the gun firing because the rounds are supersonic.
damn here i was thinking that was a reload noise of some sort

This loads people fine. What's the condition of your AV-42 when you fire the action?
Has it just landed? Does it have running engines? Is there anything else affecting it?

Hey um, when making a mission how do I 1. Make wingman that Vertically take off and follow you, and  2. Make other aircraft take off then follow a path?
Using timed events

Hey um, when making a mission how do I 1. Make wingman that Vertically take off and follow you, and  2. Make other aircraft take off then follow a path?
Using timed events
Stack up a Take Off with a Form Up On, or a Follow Path (actual action names may vary)

Do I need to give them a taxi path too?
Nope. They'll handle that themselves assuming they're in a vaguely sane position
When you tell the wingmen to take off, they will automatically choose vertical or conventional, depending on their load weight.

Alright, and if I wanted a group of like, 7 26's to take off, would I have to time each individually or would their AI know to taxi automatically, when set at a base?
They'd handle it automatically
Queuing up on the taxiway, waiting for their turn

And another question, any way to get a bunch of friendly aircraft upon take off to fly in a formation towards their target, or like, for an assault context would it be better if they just scrambled?
Could just have them fly to a waypoint to start with, then give them the attack action when they got closer
They'll automatically break and engage if they see something to kill, or something attacks them

Is there a way to spawn the same units twice?
what like copy them?
The same ones

@Dinner Plate just curious - why do they need to be same unit and not a copy? a new spawn could be made identical except internal mission editor unit number - from player's point of view it will look the same.
I was trying to see if it was possible to make an infinite scenario
If I can’t respawn the same exact unit then the mission cannot be infinite

well, then why not use that?
I wanted to see if it was possible to effectively create Hoggit Georgia at war, while Cheeses mod would make it infinite, it wouldn’t be dynamic
You can make it to be dynamic

Can anyone tell me how to add modded aircraft to my custom scenario's? When I click scenario info all that shows available for player aircraft is the 3 default aircraft.
Most custom aircraft use the fa/26b missions
Just select fa/26b

i've set up a rearm/refuel point unit in a custom mission. but everytime I land on it and request rearm/refuel via comms, the voice response is request denied (in various phrases). I've got engine off and ARM is off too.   why don't work? Is there a trick to using these units (there are 4 varieties) ?
is there a bug with duping carriers that have stuff on them?
nvm about rearm/refuel point issue.  I worked it out. mission was a joy flight and so I didn't have  Equipment Configurable set in Scenario Info. So ground crew reseponse was correct - can't rearm/refuel (I only wanted fuel) if your plane is not configured for it. Was duh moment for me.

Hey, quick question about the mission editor. Say I got 4 AI planes in the same flight group and I want them to follow a path. Do I need to create a path for each or can I assign them all to one path and will they stay in formation? I am assuming it's the latter but I can't find any detailed info on this 🙂 Thanks!
You can use an event to give the unit group an action to follow the path
It's not something that the default behaviours can do

how can I change the player's vehicle?
im making my first mission
you change it in the mission info

Units have action 'Set Invincible' - can you later 'Reset Invincible' ie make them take damage? Can't see an action for that.
I just want to prolong the fight a bit
surely set invinciable has a true false argument? i haven't used it tho

surely set invinciable has a true false argument? i haven't used it tho
didn't think of that (and didn't look either). I set up dummy action and yes  ... that's how it works!  Set Invicible is the action and you set it ON (check box) or set it OFF (uncheck box). Thanks
does the ruler measure the radius or the diameter? I assume radius but i don't want to be wrong would be a big difference

does the ruler measure the radius or the diameter? I assume radius but i don't want to be wrong would be a big difference
It measures the distance from the first point to the second
well you assumed correct as it measure the radius

in some missions (eg in The Island) there's lot of radio chatter - pilots saying they're going after baddies, evading missiles, 'Fox Two', 'ejecting' etc, Is this generated by the AI air units, or must be set up with Radio Messages events/actions?  If done automatically by AI, is there some options on units required to be set?
Thats the AI wingmen telling you what they're doing
if they get shot down they"ll say theyre ejecting or if they shoot theyll say fox 3

Are units and unit groups considered 'All Alive' if they haven't yet been spawned? I have an action triggering with a test for Allied: Alpha Is All Alive when they haven't been spawnd yet!
@Quiggles Yeah I know but I'm getting no audio  from AI units - how do you get the audio? Do they have to be wingmen? In The Island, they're not wingmen (I think)!
i think they have to be in your group but im not sure

@Quiggles Yeah I know but I'm getting no audio  from AI units - how do you get the audio? Do they have to be wingmen? In The Island, they're not wingmen (I think)!
i think they have to be in your group but im not sure
thks Quiggles I'm not sure either - in the preloaded missions The Island (preloaded with VTOL VR install) you join up with unit group of 3 x 26B 's, they shoot the shit out of the baddies and talk about it (on raidio) but I don't think  you (as Player) join their group.   Anybody else have understanding about audio behaviour of AI air units?

There’s an action you can use to hear other aircraft radio calls
thnk Skumby (good we over past shit). Is this the 'Set Radio Comms' action? How does it work - so if I enable 'Set Radio Comms' for unit X; I get (player gets) voice commentry from unit X - is that how it works?

seems like action only works for individual units, not unit groups!
if the ai aircraft are in the same group as you, they will call out by default

is there a way to change which aircraft a mission is using retroactively? just making a mission ahead of time for the helo and I was wondering if its a waste of time even trying ahead of time
yeah you can

subtitling, why? I dont know
custom voice lines mod could be neat actually. anyway sorry for offtopic
i litterally did this for every single comm type already (except ground)

Could we also get new features for the basic editor? I find it useful if specific data from a unit can be read, like it's altitude, it's attitude, it's speed, etc.
or at least see who's talking
can we move this to like #vtolvrdev

I think those are only on completion, right?
Yes
Money being pooled with the team vs per player as an option would be nice

Because I can't say I have
i swear you never need to use it unless its really complicated

Also can you set a global variable to be equal to like, the amount of units currently in mission?

global variables can only be messed with directly

Also, in the naval strike wen interceptors are sent out every like 5 minutes, did he just spam place the units or is there a better way?
He spam placed units

Multi plane spawners for continuous action. Waves of enemies every X number of minutes
Maybe it already exists, but circular logic that lets you return to previous objectives could be interesting. You could make objective-based tug-of-war pvp missions.

It could be added in later, right?
Possibly
Likely

Being able to change aircraft mid-mission. Might seem weird, but say you spawn in a AH-94, clear out the defenses, then someone can respawn in a f-35 with a strike package. It honestly might be possible out of the box just by hitting respawn when you think you're ready to change aircraft - so maybe a triggered event that can enable new spawn slots? (That can then lead to large MP battles with spawn spots being enabled/disabled based on captured bases, etc.)

@. Marsh.Mello . So you want one of the three to spawn each time, but a random one?

@. Marsh.Mello . So you want one of the three to spawn each time, but a random one?
I took it as they had three possible spawns and wanted one of them to randomly be picked.
maybe he could use a trigger event using the chance % for spawning in the units

@Skumby I tired the alt spawn but couldn’t get it to work, do you have to change or add something in the alt spawn? And do you need a conditional % for unit to spawn?  With chance even with 2 enemy’s and 50% sometimes you get nothing spawning could you give more pics if you get it to work thanks
How do you edit the briefing slides in a custom mission. I can find the description and mission image but not the spot for the briefing
you should find it all in the edit tab

Is there a way to hide all the UI within the editor?
i don't think so
Ah dang

How Does the alt spawn percentage work ? So with spawn 1 that is their at the start it is set at 100, but I cannot change it , then if I set spawn 2 to say 50 and spawn 3 to 50 how does it work with spawn 1 at 100
those are weights. 100 is just an arbitrary standard.  if all alt spawns are 100, then they all have an equal chance of being selected. if 2 and 3 are 50, then there's a 50% chance spawn 1 will be selected, and a 25% chance for spawn 2, etc
Re creating missions using the helicopter - I don't have helicopter (yet) and when create mission in mission editor - helipcopter not available in Scenario info. Also there's no helicopter AI either. IDK if this changes when have DLC helicopter.

When using the alt spawn, if I sync the group, it will add the spawns to the other members, which makes sense. However, it doesn't copy the other units' spawn options over to the new ones. I know I can work around it by defining them separately first, but I feel like this is an unintentional behavior.
Workshop support for skins would actually be cool.

Is there a hotkey for the move command or do I have to click it every time?
Awesome Thankyou
Im trying to set up a unit group to spawn after 3 other objectives are done and I am having trouble setting up the action for it.

Anybody know how to change your players callsign? I know changing unit group but what if i wanted to be Echo 2-4 instead of 1-4? If that makes sense
sadly no way to do that
this is pain

Got a big an94 mission coming out tomorrow's.  Anyone wanna do voice work? Hmu if u want in
I wouldn't mind
I, uh, don't have a voice reel handy but I'm sure you've heard my voice as the AWACS on the F-45 co-op

I see.  So there could be more than one objective going at the same time?
I've always done them in sequence.
Yeah, you can have as many objectives active as you want

Cool. And remember, if you come across other weird stuff breaking, always ask yourself, "how can I use global values to fix this?"
Global values saved my marriage
what

Do you have to shut the engines down on the 42 for infantry to board?
Nope
just open the doors while being relatively parked

Shouldn't I see all 42's in the mission as an option?
Can infantry ONLY board AI 42s?
no

Can infantry ONLY board AI 42s?
no
what does that even mean

In other words, how would I get the infantry into my 42?
Do I have to use Pick Up and Drop Off objective types in order to have infantry board and dismount?
Hey folks How would one go about scripting/modifying an RCS test mission like this one? https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763453407 I'm hoping to test the detection range for various AH-94 loadouts And against AI planes as well, if possible

Searching around the discord and found your reply, Can elaborate on how you got the AI AV-42C to properly unload infantry? I have mine setup with infantry in seats and with a sequence to land, unload, and return to orbit waypoint but it gets as far as landing and then immediately taking off again, and also straight into the ground rip.

This. The board aircraft action is only for AI. You need to use objectives for them to board and deboard the player vehicle

All actions under an event are executed at the same time. So if you’ve got an event that lands, disembarks, and takes off, the AI plane is going to get super confused

Just so I understand right, all nodes in a sequence are executed all at once if no enter/exit conditions are set? That is currently my setup.
Yeah. If you don’t have any conditions or times, it’ll do the whole thing at once
Understood, that makes sense, Last question from me is what the exit condition should be for unload? To make the AV42 wait for full disembark. I don't  see anything like "is Empty". Fallback idea is a simple timer but I generally like to avoid dead reckoning if I don't have to.

I use a proximity trigger for the infantry on their rally point that’s activated once the ai plane has landed
I figured there would be a better way than a dead timer :) great idea thanks

Why could it be? It's a smallish PNG.
There’s a possibility is putting an error message in the player.log file
I still havent a single clue on how to use global values

can I start the editor without going into VR?
Yes
If you start without a VR HMD plugged in

Is it possible to create multiplayer missions yet?
Nope
we're still waiting on them

and I believe the modded MP doesnt work anymore, is that correct?
nope
unless you revert to an old version, but I don't see a reason to

Hello, i've been trying to get an AV-42C to load up, take off, fly a path, land at a waypoint and unload. but the AV-42C gets as far as completing the flight path but doesnt attempt to land and just flies off. Is there something that i am missing to get it to land at a waypoint?
You don’t have any energy or exit conditions, so it’s doing all the steps of the sequence at once
I just had this exact question as well recently in history, check out the above for some more insight :) https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/930300229381681162

you dont put those on your maps?
Same lol
Anyway to make it so the av-42c uses vtol when it’s an AI instead of automatically doing regular flight speed?

No, to both

whats the best way to create a "wait" objective
like if i want the player to chill for like 1 min before giving the next objective

Doing some isolated AI experiments to learn about their behavior/functions... I have noticed that AI, when grouped, will stay with their group even when only one unit is given an instruction to move while the others are set to "parked" behavior. Is there any functional difference between this and using the UnitGroup Move Path? This then also asks the question what does the "follow" behavior do?
I think its kind of an escort for Plane
Groups used to automatically form up immediately even in park. Baha made a fix that they will stay in their original positiin until any move.. after which the group will form up.  I think follow is more there for following players.    Really no idea why group moves are a thing when any group unit causes the whole to move...

Hey.. question. How long does it take for MAD4 sites to deploy and what series of actions need to be ordered to transfer them from path to able to engage?
like 5, 10 seconds maybe?
"Stop" and "engage enemies" don't seem to do it. They stop and their radars go up, but no scanning.

that should be good enough

Trying to do some kind of IADS behaviour?
Eh, the point is you already destroyed the EW site and got a jump on them. I don't want it to be too hard.
👍

Can I launch the mission editor directly without going into VTOL VR or do I have to launch it from the VR menu then switch to pancake? 🙂
you can in pancake
I must be missing something 🤔

On that note, is there a launch param to skip right to mission or map editor? I noticed you don't need to keep steamVR running once you're in either. Can I skip the steamVR step?
yes
...and that is, please?

hey does anyone know how to upload missions to the workshop with custom audio included?
its that easy?
Yes

what do you not have you audio included?
BGM will save
And so will custom voice lines

i have no friends... can anyone tell me if the audio works in this? https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2717323816
well you can test it your self if you download it from the workshop
it's the same file.

Btw does anyone know when the ah-94 is coming to the mission editor?
AH-94 is already available in the editor
It was available when it launched

How do you "Set Disengage" after a "Set Engage" action?
LOL and a few more questions after that?
Well you could have classified that you meant AI helicopters because there has been no announcement on them other from “his working on it”

LOL and a few more questions after that?
Well you could have classified that you meant AI helicopters because there has been no announcement on them other from “his working on it”
I also meant “ability to fly custom helicopter missions” because it’s impossible to launch the ones from the steam workshop

Is you game on the right version?
Most recent update and I own the DLC. I can see them when I click on the workshop tab but there’s no option to launch them
I’ll try again today, haven’t had time since the weekend

Is there something broken with the mission editor when you go to launch your mission? I just started working with the mission editor today and it never loads my mission when I choose that option.  I have to completely restart the app and pick the mission from the custom missions manually.
Just tried it again and didn't have a problem this time.
I'm trying to do something that I think should be simple, I'm just trying to get some rocket artillery trucks to fire on a waypoint.  I've created a timed event, chosen "fire salvos on waypoint" after no delay.  I can tell the event is doing something, because the trucks "aim" at the waypoint, but no rockets are firing.    I've set the shots per salvo to 4, and the number of salvos as high as it will let me , 120.   I also set the reload time down really low, (5 seconds).  But I'm just not seeing any rockets launch.e

are you using allied or enemy bunkers? the enemy bunkers are destroyable but take a lot of damage
the allied bunkers seem more resilient than enemy bunkers but i have not tested it extensively
if you want to give more options to busting bunkers, you could place a soldier inside the bunker and make its death the trigger for the destruction of the bunker

could it be that the target is below a minimal range?
oh hey doombox, fancy seeing you here lol
Oh hi lol

So when you get into the vr headset does it just be a black screen for steam vr?
Or the app itself
Yeah it was a black screen and the monitor was stuck on a “darkened” version of what was on there before.

Are you using a link cable or no?
If you are using quest
No. RiftS.

how do you delete units in the editor?
Select them on the right, then click delete in the top right
ah! I'm so dumb. Was expecting to have such a button in the unit details panel. Or Del or Backspace keys to work.

wait alot of mission don't do that?
wait oh for mp
None of the MP missions do that.

I’m guessing there’s no way to right click and drag a box thing to select multiple units?
well you can use groups
True

Is there an easy way to update a map already on the workshop?
Just put it on the Workshop again
There isn't any more detailed docs than what's in the Wiki for the Mission Editor, is there?  I'm starting to make progress with my custom mission and running into some confusion over how units following paths should work, but the docs i've found are kind of lacking so i'm not sure how to make them do what I want them to do.

Mystery solved

I'm working on a mission where I want to have a "don't go there" zone.  And I'm looking for teh most effective way of killing the player (without just killing the player with an event)  In other words, how can I launch a whole boat load of missles at the player if they go into a forbidden area?     My initial attempts at this (multiple SAMs) in the area, etc, just isn't producing the "volume" of agression that I'm looking for.  Any advice?
you could use an event where if the player goes near a waypoint or unit the unit could engage the player.
that's basically what i'm trying, but I don't see the action to engage the player...

set engage enemies just toggles the engage enemies checkbox on the unit, right?  Which I already have checked.    I did get it to fire missles, but I'm looking for a very agressive, they all fire at once kind of thing, but it seems like when you tell the AI to engage it's smart about not wasting all it's ammo at once...
Thanks for your attention, by the way @Red Elite
sadly units can't use there entire arsenal at once.

but what's with the problem?
Only problem is I still need to figure out what I was just doing wrong with the SAMS just now  I was just testing with a single RADAR and SAM (hooked up to the RADAR), but it wasn't firing.
I got one to fire yesterday, but for now, the IRPACs will be good for my prototype.

is it set to engaged?
Yeah the units were set to engage enemies.
is the equip set to none?

is the equip set to none?
No, it was equipped with the FLKM-100
wierd

What is the difference between Path and Rail Path Unit Behavior?
There is no difference now
Before there was, but regular path was buggy so I made it just do the same behavior as rail path, but kept the old option to let old missions not break

Yeah I noticed that too.  Do ground units follow the path more precisely , is that how you get them to drive along roads?
Question about Proximity trigger, the checkbox for "Spherical radius" when unchecking that, does that imply **cylindrical ** radius instead of spherical?
yes

Thinking of trying out the mission editor, are there any decent tutorials for it? Also for the helicopter is it possible to do any type of pickup missions like the VTOL plane with the bay?

Where would the picked up people go?
Well I remember an oil rig mission where you take them back to the base and I did the derkaderkastan campaign and that have a few transport missions too

Like on the aircraft
they'd have to sit outside on the wings

Either way though, are there any decent tutorials out there?
Although a nice compromise would be escorting another vehicle carrying troops. Just like the idea of some logistical missions to practice flying the heli

I am wondering if this Timed event will do what I'm expecting:   Here is what I'm hoping to accomplish,   I want the same unit (golf-rocket-1) to fire 1, 2 shot salvo at 3 different waypoints in sequence.     Are the actions inside of an event run in sequence?  Or is having 3 actions for the same unit in the same Event within an Event group going to do something weird, like only execute the last action?
ignore the "22" typo in shots per salvo for the second action...
is it activated by anything?

is it activated by anything?
Yes, It will be activated by another trigger, right now I'm testing by checking that box
Which brings me to another question... Anybody have any good tricks for testing without the headset...   I've Figured how how to go into debug mode (Ins).  But is there some setting I can apply to the player (Heli) so that it just hovers in one spot while I watch my event logic unfold?

you can always use the autopilot
I'm not sure what you mean by that, I looked for actions I could apply to the player, like "enable autopilot, hover, etc" but all I see is this.

Uhhh, what just happened here? (Video) Camera broke when I was adding an objective briefing 😮
did you accidently press INS

Ha! I must have! Is that a feature? What does it do?
funny enough we were just talking about that. @_provector
LOL 😆 Ill read back some messages so

For the enemy bombers why is it that when you set them bombing location and have the right altitude.. why do they suddenly start dive bombing or just diving and they never drop their bombs?
Hmmm Tried to do a sequence event to get what I'm looking for and it is not working as expected. Notice that there are two Nodes, each with 3 actions.  What I'm expecting is that all the actions in the first node Will Occur at the same time, and then all the actions in the second node will occur.  But what is actually happening is that the last node is happening.  It's as if there really is no sequence to the sequence event, or the sequence is "give this asynchronous order" and move on to the next.   How can I stop a sequence event from progressing from one node to another until the Actions in that node are done executing?  I know I could try to hack it by adding in delays, but that defeats the point of using a sequence for me, since I don't know how long the actions are going to take, I'd have to tiral and error them.
I looked at entry and exit conditions, hoping that maybe I could put a "if unit is idle" entry or exit condition so that it only moves on once the units are done executing their orders, but I don't see anything like that.

Also anyone know the max range on enemy rocket artillery truck?
I think the wiki says 32km for that
So it can reach 24km..?

So it can reach 24km..?
Wait here I’ll check thank you!
there are no conditions for after a action is completed, you can only make a condition for the results of an action i.e. killing a target/group or getting in a position. if you're just shooting a waypoint you can place a dummy target which destruction triggers the next sequence or do it with timers as you said. also consult the https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor/Events for information about conditions and events.

Thanks @Mr_Crusoe , Ive definitely got that page open in my browser as I'm working on this.  For now I can use the delay between nodes approach, which is working OK, but not ideal.  Your suggestion of using a dummy target brings me to my next little stumbling block.  I've got the sequence running with the delays and now I want to be able to repeat the sequence.  I tried Begin(ing) the Event I'm already in to start it up again, but that didn't work.  So I tried Begin(ing) a different event that just begins my main event again and that didn't work either.  So now it makes me wonder whether any event types (timed trigger or sequence) are repeatable?  I don't see that limitation mentioned in the Wiki, but it would seem to me so far that I can't run an event more than once (from my experimentation)
Nothing is repeatable
I think it could be cool to have something where you have to use the A2G radar on the Heli without the eots

But theres no way to force turn it off right?
Issue is to employ weapons you still need the TADS (or I guess you can use GPS weapons)

Does anybody know what type of serialization the mission .vts file is in?   I can get around the "nothing is repeatable" issue I have with events by creating more complex events, but doing so with the GUI will not be fun, but it would be easy for me to edit the .vts file directly... Even easier if I could do it with some code.    I don't recognize the format at first glance but it looks like a cleaner version of JSON (no quotes).
Would'nt be suprised if it uses the custom format baha made

Yeah it is

Do you say that by just looking at it, or do you know for certain that the format being used is custom.  I ask, because even though we don't recognize it as a very common one (JSON, YAML, etc) it might still be something common with the toolchain that is used to develop the game?
Im fairly confident, iv used quite a few formats and never seen this, and looking at the game code I *think* its fully custom
Ok yeah it is custom

Educate me on this... Is the code for VTOLVR open?  Or do you have access to
im writing a vts2json just for the fun of it
No and no, but you can decompile the code and take a peak

What is it developed in?
All method names retain their original names, and the decompiler is quite good about guessing names to things
Unity/C#/mono

found some rando parser maybe? https://github.com/taniwha/cfgnode
But the config node class thats in vtol seems to be not as an external project
Yeah, maybe custom built by the KSP devs and then "borrowed" by BD?

@BahamutoD Any info about the VTS file format/how we could possible parse it and work with it?

@BahamutoD Any info about the VTS file format/how we could possible parse it and work with it?
Well, that worked like a charm.  Since I can't repeat the event, I just opened up the VTS and edited it by hand to "unroll the loop" and run my sequence 3 times instead of just once.  Worked nicely.  That will work for me for now.
Is there some sort of official place to make feature requests for the game and mission editor?  Being able to repeat an event, or have a sort of rudimentary "goto" capabilities within an event to allow for some repetition would be really nice.  But I suspect that the engine needs to support that sort of thing before you could add anything to the editor.

@Red Elite nice detail there!  and as far as "amateur" i'd say "beginner" is more appropriate....

I would LOVE to be able to fly around in Cities Skylines maps...
uhh.  you understand there is no x shape building in the map editor

Anyone know max range on MPA-155?
~~their file format is more proprietary than actual Paradox content lol, good luck exporting them~~

Thinking about doing a mission where you either first scout out targets and mark GPS coordinates of stationary threats (airbases, FOBs, SAMs, etc) and then RTB and attack them from high speed and altitude. *Or,* you are assigned a scout taking and wingmen (/other players eventually) will attack. Is it possible to use GPS markers in missions this way for use in forwarding the mission? Like a specific marking, not simply just *target->is locked in TECAS/TGP/EOTS*
My thinking is realistically you only might know an area of movement of the enemy, not specific targeting locations
uhhh is dev talking about something else?

uhhh is dev talking about something else?
Yes red   want to give the AH a use in scouting as well, not just attacking but forward assistance and tactical aid
oh i though i was going crazy due to the time

can you change the detection mode in the editor events?
because i cant se it
I’m still unclear what that really does

“Is a target point set? Sent? Ok good we will hit it.”
It’s up to the players coordinates to be good if they want a kill or not
Buddy lazing would also be nice one day

Are they marked force undetected?

Hey, ive been playing around with editor too, however it seems to just be for single player missions, how do i change to multiplayer and add the appropriate spawns?
mp missions have just released today in the public testing branch, expect nothing to work lol
Still too many

Out of curiosity, is there a way to force or restrict players to only one team? (I want to make PVE scenarios)  I would like to avoid the trouble of having players join by mistake the other side, since absolutely no considerations will be made for team B as team A is considered the default for PvE scenarios
Obviously i don't expect things (and features) to work yet, but i'd like to stress test things a bit and setup the foundations of the missions so to speak
I'm not sure I understand how the new mission editor for MP is supposed to work? We can still only spawn 1 player spawn and I am seeing 0 changes on the UI to help us place spawns or change their team

is there an issue with the editor button on flat screen?
it launches VR and switches audio devices
Which is a minor inconvenience, but someone mentioned a shortcut parameter a few days ago. If it's not a thing, that's fine.

anyone else having a problem with mission not loading in the editor?
been here for like five minutes
The log'll likely have some errors in it

Is the 8 per team likely to change at all?
is there any way to respawn units apart from spamming copy/paste?
I hope not as that would be a lot of traffic to one computer

16 players factored in at the moment. If I can put all 16 on one side for a PVE mission I'll be happy.

Can you explain that further please? I know what the UI is but curious to see what the limitation might be.
inb4 the briefing room just isn't big enough 😄
There's no scroll bars

Can you launch a MP mission from the inside editor?
Nope
Mp isn’t in the editor yet

I may be just missing the obvious, how do you enable rearm on a carrier?
you don't?
should it be automatic? Was just watching a mission tester land on the carrier and get "rearm not available", Landed on the elevator.

Engine off?
It worked for me by just plonking a carrier down

Not sure. from the vanilla missions it would prompt you to turn your engines(or weapons) off, right? instead of the straight "rearm not available" text. But yeah sounds like it should just already be available, thanks, I'll play around with it.
:catshrug:
if it's for an mp mission, it could be possible that you have to go to your spawn to rearm

Alright I'm done converting one of my weird mission to MP, with kind of a complex logic, no issue so far as host. **The biggest grip is steam workshop not updating fast enough when you upload a version up**. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2723033273&searchtext=
but co op missions arent supported yet
it is in public testing

... Is that a human centitanker?
Hey I am trying to play a bmg but when I pick the clip it wont play, I checked the clip itself and it works fine
Also whenever I try and choose bgm it wont let me save the game for some reason. It makes me "Save game as new copy" or something

Define "works fine". Is it a mono or stereo audio file?
As in when I open it up in my files it plays fine. When I add it to the bmg it dosent play
Probably an issue with it being a mono file, then

So its the file thats the problem?
Just tested every other file I had and those dont work either
Open it up in a program like Audacity, if it looks like the top file then it's mono, if it looks like the bottom one then it's stereo

How is the 94's free flight map called?
What
Internally, what is the map called

Am I missing something? I can't find the menu to add an MP spawn
are you on the public testing branch?
yes

are you on the public testing branch?
yes
redfor has a blank menu

I don’t think you can be in public testing for mission editor?
nope I made my entire campaign in PT a year ago
needed quick updates from baha for some features

I am not sure then, @BahamutoD while you're here do you have any ideas? They are trying to play an audio track as BGM but it refuses to load (and I think messes up saving?)
They can play it as a music track though
What is the audio file?

What is the audio file?
Well I can play any audio clip thru radio but literally nothing works thru bmg
Are you on PT?

Did you turn off BGM volume in settings?
I.e. can you hear the music when you're in the main menu?
Actually lemme check that

To get your player.log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows Key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log". 4. Upload this file into #public_testing, or whatever channel you are asked to do so in.

Is there a way to show players how much Global Value is left? I want it to appear on the objective MFD page. But if it cannot, I want it to show on system message.
You could print it every time a trigger condition is true

Is there a way to show players how much Global Value is left? I want it to appear on the objective MFD page. But if it cannot, I want it to show on system message.
You could print it every time a trigger condition is true
so for every value it can be:

Question.. what even is global value and how do you use it?
It is an arbitrary value that can be used to do literally anything you want
An event can increment or decrement it's value

How do you use them?
Wait do you have to know how to code?
Nope

Wait do you have to know how to code?
Nope
you just need to know conditions

thing a complete? increment or change value x
value x =/>/< y? trigger event b
perhaps you want to keep track of the number of objectives a player has completed

value x =/>/< y? trigger event b
perhaps you want to keep track of the number of objectives a player has completed
with each one, you increment a value by 1, thus keeping a count that can trigger other events or objectives

Through a redbull-fueled rampage and the help of you guys here in discord I created my first 3 missions involving the helicopter DLC over the last 14 hours non stop. Much thanks to my friends for actively testing (and still currently testing) as I developed. If anyone would like to help test that would be greatly appreciated, The third missions has yet to be tested, but the other two have been and are confirmed in a playable and apparently enjoyable(tm) state. I intend to improve these over time (better briefings, robust edge case logic, balance) but the baseline missions are done. Thanks again! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2722787658
What a champ.
hey guys. i asked in the steam forum if its possible to crteate a mp mission in the editor. they said in the public testing it is possible. so i went into that but i cant place more then one player spawn. is it rly possible to create a multiplayer mission and if so, what am i doing wrong there? 😄

You need to start it as a multiplayer mission
A mission can't be both single and multi

how do i start a mission in the editor for multiplayer? i havent seen a button or anything for that 😄
You need to create a campaign
There's a Multiplayer tickbox next to the aircraft selection button

so its not working in the standalone mission tab? that explains why i havnt seen that 😄
Does that mean we can only have one aircraft type for mp missions
No. It means you can't select aircraft type if the campaign is multiplayer

how can i trigger a mission complete thing for a mp mission?
I assume it works the same way as it does for single player missions. Complete the last active objective
ah allright 🙂

Is it possible to open existing non-user made mission in editor? I am curious about AH-94 "Surprise Attack" mission...
No
k

You making a single player mission?
If you're making an MP campaign, the launch button is non functional.
Because launching multiplayer missions from the editor doesn’t work

MP Mission Editor - is there a way to embark infantry onto a player VTOL that I'm missing at all please?
like form up?
or engage

Is that SP Mission Editor or MP?
yeah that might be a bug for mp then
That's fine 🙂

Is there a way to spawn units in the game or do I just have to have all the units placed but like, deactivated?
yeah turn spawn immediately off
Oh but I still have to have the unit in the game already? I can't dynamically spawn units?

Oh but I still have to have the unit in the game already? I can't dynamically spawn units?
then you spawn it using an action
correct

Do all helipads have a rearm function or do I have to add that somehow?
i think a rearming point is a unit? i cant remember
There is a Ground Support object  called "Rearm Refuel A / B / C/ D"

Ahh cool thanks

Can I not add funds to the player in a mission?
I did a sample objective which rewarded funds and it only rewarded part of it and only after I left the mission
I've created a very simple practice mission in a multiplayer coop campaign: * 2 x F/A-26B (player spawn) * 2 x AV-42C (player spawn) * 6 x Enemy Tank To try it out, do I have to upload it? (I believe "Launch Scenario" doesn't work for multiplayer yet). Thanks

It does on public testing branch.

Do we know about misisons funds?

The mission might not work, so I feel a bit bad about uploading it...

@Vampaca I saw your comment on my campaign and I'm sorry to hear that you had trouble. Would you be willing to help me test the missions at a later time, perhaps this weekend, for the new updates? I haven't updated them in almost a year and a half but I have recently realized I still have all the required files.
Is there a way to place more player spawns for a coop mission? or is there another way you place the spawns/etc?
You can only create an MP mission by creating an MP campaign, once you do this you should be able to place multiple MP spawns

Thats very helpful, I was in the standalone mission editor, Thanks!

How do you make a multiplayer campaign?
Mission editor > campaign > check the little box that says “mp” or “multiplayer” I forgot what it says exactly
ahh i figured it out, wasnt on the public testing build, thanks again!

Were you able to solve this issue?
lol spoilers
:blobaww:

Is there an allied ground unit that can swim? 🤔 thinking of an amphibious landing...
No 😦 I wanted mobile radar, but it seems broken. Actually their is a dirty work around, make them start in Engage : True, and order them individually (not the group) on start to Engage false and follow a path , the mad radar will stay deployed, but it will move. Then when you want re enable the Engage enemies on each unit.
Nice finding. Definitely seems bugged. In my tests if engage enemies was not checked in editor before mission start, It would simply never deploy in missions under any circumstance. Even with just a simple timer event without moving.   Do you know if the radar still function and ping the player while it's moving with that work around?

Yes  the radar is active  when up when the mad-4 radar move and ping you.
It really hope it get fixed

Or you can exploit the bug to have mobile radars giving info the SAM ?
Actually it be nice to have a Stop to Engage option on them, similar to tanks
Thats pretty mucj what I was trying to do when I discovered this bug lol. A MADs patrol group that would sort of stop to engage but otherwise was on a constant loop

Does a sequence simply not run more than once?
the alt spawn is only for individual unit too 😦 it be sweet for group
All events can only occur once

what does sync does tho, it spawn the whole group on the same spawn pos?
or it keep their position relative in the formation?
No

or it keep their position relative in the formation?
No
😛

What's the setup for the other members of the group?
sync group too
When you tick the box on the group leader, it creates an Alt Spawn entry for each member of the group for each alt spawn for the leader. You then need to assign each of those alt spawn entries a location

On a semi-related noob note. If I have 8x infantry dudes, and they are all in the same group, will they move in a formation by default/behave as a unit at all?
It'll be difficult to get them to NOT move in a unit
They'll move in whatever formation you tell them to

Thank you, is there a place to set that group formation behaviour?
Use an event
Think it's on the Unit Group

if i read properly, each alternate spawn has its own move order behavior ?
I don't bother with the default behaviours, so not a clue
let me try quick

Unless there is way to know on which alt spawn the group has spawned  to send the proper event?
Proximity events would be how I'd do it
and there is no triggered by Unitgroup 😦

Do funds earned from objectives only get added after the mission is finished?
dumb question, is there anything specific I need to do in order to flag a mission as multiplayer compatible? I have alternate spawns for the 'player' unit but idk if i'm supposed to do other stuff
MP mission must be in a new campaign that is checkboxed as multiplayer when initially created. MP spawn positions are their own type of unit. You must be on the public_testing branch currently to create a MP campaign. Note that you currently cannot make individual scenarios MP and it must be a campaign.

ah ok cool

do you know where the default missions and campaigns are saved?
They’re not openable or editable
ah alright

I’m going to try and make a COD mission for the AV-42, is it possible to have cargo in a mission in some form or just passengers ?
Someone else may have a better idea, but my solution to that would be using a global variable for "cargo loaded" and use waypoint triggers/timers to "load the cargo" at pickup location and "unload the cargo" at dropoff location.
That sounds good enough to model it

Heyo! Any way to get passengers to hop into multiplayer aircraft?
hey guys. is there a way to trigger the spawning of enemy aircrafts with the comms tab? so i have to get into comms in the MFD and then i can spawn them?
want to do that for a practice mission

using conditional

ah so when i turn on the strobe lights for example i can spawn them?
yup
ty 🙂

how do I remedy this?
what is the unit?
all of them

how do I place  a player spawn point?
sorry this is my first time using this, im just trying to build a mission so I can practice dodging missles because im struggling with that xD
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2189296631 this could help

Anyone know if it's possible to set wether respawns are allowed in multiplayer?
Not yet
you got multiplayer stat tho, so you could force finish the mission when too many player died

Anybody know if there is a way for steam workshop to force sync faster? (other than unsub/sub)
I was outlining a possible mission I might do later, does anyone have something to add as a vague objective possibility?

EVAC soldiers hot

fucked up lol

Question about multiplayer campaign editor (on public_testing branch) Is there a difference to "upload to steam workshop" in campaign overview or mission editor? From campaign, would it upload all the missions? Thanks
it should still upload all the missions and it would be uploaded under multiplayer campaigns
Thank you. I added a briefing image and the objective waypoint to the mission, but neither of them showed up. Do the subscribed campaigns/missions automatically update themselves? I couldn't see a way to check for any updates.

If you want to update a mission you just have to press the upload button again and it should automatically update it
Steam workshop is kind of slow. you better unsub/ resub your campaign every change :/

Does anyone know if funds rewards only matter after a mission?
Iirc they can be granted for completing objectives
I have them but it seems to only matter to campaigns. Like you only get them after the mission is completed

Off the cuff curious, other than funds, is there a system for structuring munition or fuel availability?
I have a great idea but I need to be able to reward funds in the same mission
MP coop campaign (public_testing) "Easy Missions"
 1st mission "Destroy the Tanks" works fine.  2nd mission "Intercept the Patrol" doesn't work as intended: * I was unable to make enemy planes start in the air * I created an enemy carrier and put 2 planes on the deck (with an orbit waypoint) but they didn't take off.  I'll see if I can fix it later today. I'll try setting the planes to "take off" (they are currently set to "orbit").

What did you set the airspawns to?
I've set their default behaviour to TakeOff. They have an orbit waypoint. Hopefully they'll fly there after taking off.
Not sure what you mean by "airspawns". I'll have a look when I'm next in the editor.

When selecting the mission... I see the mission image, but to the right is an "image missing". I see other missions sometimes have an image there (a terrain map?), but I can't see a way of adding an image there.
There is campaign image, Mission image, Briefing note image, if that help
Thank you. I've set images for all of them - campaign, mission and briefing (I'm using the same image for mission and briefing). There's still an "image missing" to the right of the mission image. I'll have another look after work to see if I've missed anything. I'm on public_testing. Campaign is "Easy Missions".

its a multiplier mission too, you are sure to have lastest workshop version of it?
what you mean latest workshop version? its my own i created 😄 everytime i upload it to test it, i get the newest 😄
you get it from the workshop manually?

what you mean latest workshop version? its my own i created 😄 everytime i upload it to test it, i get the newest 😄

yes after i uploaded it i had to sub to it in order to have it ingame for the multiplayer host game thing

Yesterday I found that uploading the *campaign* didn't update the missions (after a de-sub and re-sub too). Uploading the *mission* seemed to work. However, it could be that I hadn't allowed enough time for the *campaign* uploading to register.

So did you upload it on public testing?
Yes
Weird

Hey guys, i'm trying to make an online mission for the steam workshop and im trying to launch the scenario but it says im missing spawn points even if i have multiple. Any suggestions?
you cant launch a mp mission sadly
you have to upload it and play it through mp

is there an way to make a single player mission into an mp campagin?
well.....
well you could add this to the campaign file but thats a guess

quick question: If you set a trigger event to be enabled and conditional, can it only trigger once, or will it always trigger so long as it hasn't been deactivated and the conditions are met?
well i don't actually know but i think you can create loops as i accidently created a loop and after the game started my game crashed
Rip

you guys think this is enough air defense?
Your RWR is going to sound like an orchestra
Anyways I got this carrier in an MP public testing mission, with default behavior being navigate path, that path being the yellow line running under the carrier. However, for some reason the carrier refuses to move

is there anyway to make an AI AV42 or F45 hover in a mission?  The Nav Speed action seems to have floor setting  60m/s
No
there's a "CONVERT TO MP" button in the campaign edit window

Are you within 25m of the objective when you come to a halt?
yes
I'd jack it up to at least 200m to be sure

btw, is there a way to copy an entire mission to make the same mission again but with little tweaks?
Just copy the file/folder, if you're careful
You want to not copy the workshop info, so that it won't overwrite the other copy of it on the workshop

Missionathon? Lol that's pretty much what I did for Misc-Missions the day we got public testing MP. Thatd be a fun thing to try with a few people with a start to finish time and then play
"Mission jam"
😄

How many aircraft can the assault carrier hold? Dosent say on wiki
6
Thank you!

Hi, anyone know the range (and conditions) at which infantry will shoot at each other?
I'm sure I had this working on previous MP missions (infantry were shooting at each other).
Now it seems to just be the tanks.

did their visual range change?
Maybe?
mk1 eyeballs

They can at least see armor, are you sure they won't *try* to shoot it?
hmm
they will attack then

it will not engage tanks with its gun?
Yeah it wont
Which seems almost like a bug...?

Which seems almost like a bug...?
SRAD gunner with his testicles of steel like... eh, it wont pen, guess i'll take the hit
:risitas:

Here's a question: is LOS blocked by buildings? (for ground units)
Does anyone know where I can find the smoke effect object thing in the mission editor
System -> System -> Light Flare

How do you make an AWACS for Team B?
good question, they have one in Naval Strike coop mission
and the F-45 one as well

maybe the unit isnt avaible yet in the mission editor?
But thats kinda hard when I cant place a AWACS for Team B
I guess

the unit is here, maybe it was left out of the selector by accident?
baha pls
pls baha

Also, why are the External 120s in the 45 not the 120Ds?
I thought that was fixed :thonkery:
Atleast in the editor its the normal 120

I'm new to using the mission editor.  I noticed that some of you are experimenting with MP missions in the public_testing branch.    I'm trying to decide if I want to play around with that now, or wait for it to go GA.    So I'm just curious as to how long things usually sit in public testing before they get released?
like a couple of months or less
Baha has mentioned planning on making the PT -> Stable cycle quicker

Did they remove the drone launching cruiser?
no
What about in public testing?

What about in public testing?
no
weird

When you add 3 radio messages like this will they que up from the top or play all at the same time?
They will queue
If you choose priority radio message, it will interrupt the previous message instead of queuing

So it wil start from the top down?
Yes
Thank you!

Rocket artillery are not firing. Target waypoint area is about 750m away. Could this be too low? Or could buildings be obstructing a clear shot? Thanks.
It's likely the arty's driver cab is blocking the shot
Try rotating them so they fire sideways

Interesting... The rocket artillery are now about 3km behind the front lines. They are each placed on top of a hill. Their rockets are landing way too far behind the waypoint target area (about 3km!). Could this be due to their high elevation?
On my next pass, I'll try setting the rocket artillery to just "Engage Enemies" rather than that plus "Fire at Waypoint Area". (Perhaps altitude of the area waypoint is taken as the altitude of the firing unit, and engaging enemies will take the altitude of targets into account).
If you want you can set each arty to a certain smaller waypoint. I recommend maybe put them on a semi flat elevation. If they are at too much of an angle they might not be able to aim properly.

hey. i want to have an E-4 Overloard in the air. i dont have a friendly airbase on the map. can i spawn it in mid air so its instnatly there and flying?
Yes
how can i set it up so its flying in 30.000ft?

how can i set it up so its flying in 30.000ft?
i cant set it higher then 10000
The values in the editor are all in metric

is target group 1 (for sending wpt to gps) always 1 if i want it to be the player? (singleplayer)
hey anyone able to talk me through adding player spawns in the editor
trying to do a heli pvp map with FA-26's mixed in

Is the campaign set to MP already?
if not, you have to make a new campaign and make sure to tick the "multiplayer" setting when creating it
gotcha\

Are you in the public testing branch?
...
please hold

Have you created the campaign?
yes
and converted to MP

what target group do i have to define to send a mission waypoint to the gps of the player? (singleplayer)
what?
wait i send a screenshot 😄

so putting the waypoints into sequence should fix my problem?
I’m still not sure what the problem even is
Or what you’re trying to do

You’re sure the event/objective is firing?
yers
yes

What does your GPS screen look like afterwards? Screenshot please
its just empty
hmm how do i get the mission to show up on my list once i saw it?

hmm how do i get the mission to show up on my list once i saw it?
Multiplayer or single player?
What enemy units can attack the carriers ingame?

What enemy units can attack the carriers ingame?
like anti ship roles?
rocket boat

Oh, as in the enemy naval units?
Yo
Anyone know how to fix this issue ?

Anyone know how to fix this issue ?
I am not entirely sure, I think the LMSS ship can use its forward missiles to sink your ships
yo-yo

Looks like the only way to remove a unit from the map is to use a "kill" action. Is that true?
You can delete them
Unless you are in the mission you can setup a kill action to get rid of em

Seems strange for delete to not exist. You bring units to a waypoint next to a building. Maybe they go inside?
The bombers really need lot of clearance to land on airport :/ otherwise they just hit mountains on the alignment
I'm confused

Also, in the MP editor, is there a way to give command of AI units to only one player? Or is it for the entire team
Does anyone know how to launch mp custom games without uploading them
You can't

With the multiplayer officially coming out can we make multiplayer mission and campaigns in the editor yet? Also if we can make a mulitplayer mission in the editor can we make it so the players can fly more then one style of aircraft? Can I have say 2 Helos and 2 airplanes?
The multiplayer missions editor is in development. If you want custom multiplayer missions, check out the public testing branch
Ok thanks. Ill keep my eyes open then.

Timed Event Group  * Begin Immediately (check box) - if checked, the event triggers immediately when mission starts. * Intial Delay - if "Begin Immediately" is not checked, then this sets the delay until event triggers. * Time (s) - applied for individual actions? (added to the initial delay).  Have I got the above correct? Thanks
No
The initial delay is the delay from when it's triggered to when it starts trying to fire the sub events

Is "Time (sec)" applied per action? Is it the duration of the action?
After the event group has been triggered, it'll wait Initial Delay. After that, each sub event is entirely independent, and will wait Time (sec) before firing all the contained actions at the same time
In your screenshotted example, it'll Begin Immediately, wait 0s initial delay, then wait 0s Time(

Oo on that note, can you confirm what "is/is not destroyed" means for the rigs? I haven't gotten to really test it, you can destroy parts, you can also destroy the leg support and make the platform uneven. When is it actually considered "Destroyed"?
when the oilrig is tilted it is considered destroyed
awesome thanks, that means I have an issue elsewhere with my triggers not firing

How do you add in player spawns for the test branch multiplayer missions in the editor?
like in the normal version
you cant add in multiplayer player spawns in the normal version

do you have to do something special before it shows up?
i dont think so
A mission can’t be both single and multiplayer

What is the 'allowed slots' slider do on the ah94? is it for the copilot?
Not for sure, but I assume it's Allowed slots: 1 = only pilot appears as a slot in MP lobby. Available slots: 2 = both pilot and gunner appear as slots in MP Lobby.
yup

what will happen if i add more?
not supported (aka bug, unintented behaviors, and crashes)
i wish the player slots were not locked to a spesific vehicle

Does it still show the mission as 8 player in the list tho ? Like if you have 8 f45 + 8 FA26
ok so now i have a custom mp mission. how do i play it?
you have to upload it to the steam workshop and play it through the games mp function

oh

how do you play it? its uploaded, i have it downloaded but i cant select it. only can vote, uninstall, or view info
im idiot
Start a lobby, and choose it

What's it called? I'll load it and debug it
multiplayer testing or something like thhat, no icon. made by 16
i reload the game to see name

@74 It had separate briefings for each team right?
oh lol. yeah.
Ok, well temporary workaround until I fix it would be to make it only one briefing

did you use "copy" options on the mp spawns to make multiple mp spawn?
This is the bug that killed my "Land War" Mission. AH-94 pilot seat goes to F-45. I believe this is related to copy/pasting the MP spawn unit. Haven't been able to run it to ground yet, but that is my current assumption.
If a trigger sets a bomber to bomb a waypoint, will a nearby player cause the bomber to abort? Or will the bomber continue on its run?

If a trigger sets a bomber to bomb a waypoint, will a nearby player cause the bomber to abort? Or will the bomber continue on its run?
IIRC the AI will do its duty unless it is engaged (e.g. the player starts firing missiles at it), then it will evade
If they successfully evade they'll go back to whatever they were doing

@Hoizen  do you still have the mission with the glitch slot that put you in the wrong plane?
yup, haven't touched it since last tested broken. CO-08 Land War (1) in my coop mission pack.
how does it look int the vts file§

Does that unit instance ID show up anywhere else?
Negative. Only two helos: 215 and 216. Both unique IDs.
Can you reorder the spawn id to match the slot list or vice versa?

Can you reorder the spawn id to match the slot list or vice versa?
Currently matching, though I can test the reverse next upload.   215: AH-94 216: AH-94 217: F-26 218: F-26 219: F-45 220: F-45
I need to proof check all my mission slot now just to be sure 😄

so peaking at the vts now... spawnChance = 100, I'm assuming this is default for Alt Spawn 1, I know you can't change it in editor UI... if I changed it here... does it turn into a chance to spawn at all? Assuming not... but that would be very nice to have :P It would be nice to have a quick probability to spawn or not spawn an AI at all.
it s easy to test in sp 😄
just remember that if the mission has been loaded once; you need to reload the game to take the new .vts change

Anyone play around with budgets with MP campaigns? Is the system supported?
didn't tested
can someone help me im trying to make my mission multiplayer by putting it into the campaign editor but I made it on standalone mission and cant find how

Are custom static scenery models supported in the mission editor? (Or the map editor I guess)  I have an idea for something to add to my mission but it won’t work if I can’t make a simple custom model to add.
Btw I was super excited to see I went from about 20 subs to 200+ subs in the last couple days, so now I’ve got extra motivation to make it worth the players time for hitting that subscribe button!
When I launch my scenario in multiplayer it just loads an endless black screen, could someone help?

When I launch my scenario in multiplayer it just loads an endless black screen, could someone help?
No
Thanks @Skumby , are the any options for getting creative?  For instance, are there any models that can be placed by hand editing the map or mission files, that don't normally appear in the editor?

Not that I know of
Mission creators, please, for god's sakes, don't make 15 min straightline heli flights in your missions they're really not fun

anyone know where a guy can get a mission thats just the target practice mission with multiplayer like the freeflight/airshow mission?
I’ll be making one inside of a map wide city for ah-94
Performance be damned

Hi, when I try to test a multiplayer campaign mission in the editor I get the error, that I need to place a player spawn point, I am using the public_testing branch, is this a bug or do I need to place something other than a MP Spawn?
You cannot test MP missions in the editor. Only way is to upload it and test it in-game
ah okay, thanks!

Performance wise, does a ground unit is less expensive on the cpu than a air unit?
Good question. my hypothesis says yes. Sounds like a SP mission stress test time.
tried with 50 tank vs  50 aircraft, but i need better tool to check the perf change than cpu charge which show the same

what if you added another 0?
100 tanks on path
100 planes on orbit:

Does anyone have any documentation and or videos pertaining to making Multiplayer Missions from the basics ?
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor
Anyone know how to fix a blackscreen for when you start a mission?

Anyone know how to fix a blackscreen for when you start a mission?
Thanks.
v1.3.5p1 Multiplayer     - Fixed: black screen when trying to launch a multiplayer game with more than 8 slots on a team with separated briefings (added Separated Large room)

you got too many slot?
Ah
Yeah

what I mean is there's no need, that seems pretty conclusive, yeah?
its not trouble, and it be more accurate
with just 100 tanks vs. 100 jets, a difference of 1.4x is big

Ooi, what are the stats for a completely empty mission?
speaking of which, i think theres an issue with the KC-49, 75 KC-49s perform much worse than 75 MQ-31s
i will try and get profiler data some other time

How many aircraft is there in the mission Naval strike?
It be nice to have a performance cost in the editor , based of unit index and how many spawn from the start.
I'm trying to a make a multiplayer mission on the test branch, but I'm running into a problem uploading to steam. I've added 3 MP Spawns for each team, but it's giving me a 'No player spawn.' error.

or if there's something else I need to do?
can only test them after downloading them from the workshop
Yeah, but I can't figure out how to *upload* it

your campaign has been created with muptiplayer box checked?
That or maybe just get an initial spawn set
also editing .vts file might require game reboot to load  the change properly

Is the mission even inside a campaign?
no, it's a standalone
I don’t believe that’s allowed

There's no point in setting refuel points at airbases, correct?
They're usually meant for FARPS and places that AREN'T at airbases, no?
or tanker

but yes

Is there anyone here ever worked with the custom scenario assets mod? If so could someone tell me if it’s possible to upload workshop content with custom assets and how difficult it is to make custom units?
Also is it possible to make custom missions for multiplayer PvP yet?
Did you read the mod description?

For anyone also having this issue, I disabled the mod loader then revalidated the game files, and it fixed the issue.
Anyone know what 'StayInRadius' behavior for ground units does? I know what is sounds like it should do, but not seeing how to set what radius to stay in haha.

hello mission makers. does anyone have out a mission in which you go into an area and evac soldiers under fire? i've been practicing my j hook landings in the chopper and want to try it out in an evac mission. thanks in advance.
Is there an easy way to take photos for the briefing in the mission editor?

Check out the wiki page for the mission editor, the debug options like free cam and time manipulation might help.

Cheers, yeah just found something about that. Gonna see how to enable it now @bradtank44

I want to get some good screenshots for the image panel in the briefing notes to polish up my mission.  What is the best workflow for that?  I could just play through the mission and take screenshots of the s-cam, but is there a way to pause the game to enable better control over the s-cam for taking the screenshots?  What workflow do you guys use to get good screenshots for your missions?
lol!!!
Insert cam

are you talking about using debug mode instead of launching the mission in the headset?
You cannot launch a mission without a headset
well you kinda can

Do you have to do something specific?
From the mission editor, choose "launch->launch scenario" (CTRL-L)  Choose your pilot, etc. In the "locker room" Just hit the "R" key onyour keyboard and it will jump into the game without you putting on your headset.
then hit "Insert" to enable that debug cam you spoke of.  Then keys like [ and ] to switch units, etc are all active.

Anyone having trouble uploading to the Steam workshop?
When I upload nothing happens and no new mission was uploaded to Steam's workshop.
Tested it with the example mission and it worked. Don't know why mine doesn't even load the UI for uploading.

dang. so it wont let you put that as an objective and finish it with the ah94?
If you have a AV-42 and AH-94 in your mission that s fine
I think it can be simulated. I'll be doing just that to emulate the silly ladder pick-ups of Desert Strike in my Desert Strikes Back campaign. Can't wait to see if it works out :LUL:

can anyone clarify what is the difference between "path" and "railpath" for ground units? As far as I can tell, it seems to have something to do with getting things to move on roads?
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/931756308019945502
whoops, guess I should have searched first

Will only one of these events fire, or is there a chance to fire the first three?
Only one will fire, chosen at random, but it won’t be there even 4 way split I assume you’re expecting
Yes

So, for example, 33% would be 33% and 49.5?
33% for the first, 50% for the second
You are splitting a split cake

I'm doing mission edit, and when I select audio in the briefing screen, can I continue to play the music that was played in note1 in note2?
no, each note stop and play on each slide
hmmmm so sad

Can someone send me a link to instructions on how to add multiplayer spawns for players?
Step 1 is to be editing a multiplayer mission
Where is the option for that in game? Or do I need a mod?

Where is the option for that in game? Or do I need a mod?
You need to be on the public testing branch, and create a mission in a multiplayer campaign
ohhh. ok, i'll try that. Thankyou.

Did I cover all the bases?
If I set the detection mode to force undetected it should make enemy aircraft not detect it right?
Just made a co op mission in the public test branch. I was told you needed to make it in test branch so you can add multiplayer slots so I did. Now none of the aircraft slots can rearm. There are no weapons to choose from. Did I do something wrong or is there a specific work flow I need to follow? Love the game btw guys.

Force detected/undetected only applies to what the player can see on their NAV map

At the beginning of the mission.

Is there a NOT gate?
only "AND" and "OR"
we need nand and xor

Noob to the forum here. I'm having a problem with some enemy armor floating in the air when I load some of my custom missions. They float high, like 4000 AGL. They're still operational, the SAM shoots at me. And other units start driving randomly, either over the moutnains of Akutan or into the sea. Does anyone know how to stop all that from happening? I'm trying to finish off a campaign.
So I have to publish my milt-player mission before I can test it because it doesn't show up in the multiplayer  menu.
how do i make a mp campaign

On another note are unit movement speeds in the editor (for ground vehicles) in knots?
all in metric
POG

Thats a very beautiful map, I'm a VFX artist who has fallen upon this beautiful map and mission editor, I've got my first solid mission complete, and very short campaign planned, but for sure need to look into maps like yours. Did you use a height map for that, Saybro?
na i think that one comes with the game
Ahhh cool. At work, I use all kinds of amazing assets, and I am just dying to apply that to this.

Wow man, holy crap, Thank you, how nice is that of you? Dude, thanks. I used the Map editor to make my own and use a few sat map shots of Syria to create my own chunk for my first stab at using the Mission Editor to really tell a real life story to the player as a part of that story. I cant stop finding things in the mission editor that are surprising me, I've wanted something like this to use for a while. Thanks again, you are too cool, thank you.
There's one other thing I kind of find I need, and dont know how to make happen. I need a Reset - or Repeat node in the command tree. I really would like to be able to have a string Reset, and be able to be Tripped again, perhaps with a TIME delay box like many of the other nodes have. It would be beyond useful, to be able to have a message that could be tripped by Proximity alone, and display a message, or play a radio reply. Is that functionality there somewhere beyond my couple days work so far? I use nodal systems like this at work for years and years, so within a couple hours I had most things working, but couldnt find that functionality.
No. There is no way y to fire an event twice. There are no loops

Damn, thank you so much, I asked once before a few days ago, but it seemed like it might be there, thank you for the answer.

I wonder then, would there be a way to cascade the effect, have One, turn on another as it is tripped? So, you would stack the pile, with the top tripping the next, tripping the next, etc?
Kind of a Faked repeat
It would be so nice to just have a node at the end before Output and was a reset with delay, soooo useful

Ohhhh!!!!!!! Cool, ok, I'll try that today. So, you would have an Event, thats trigged by an event, but, is there a Delay to activate node so its not a line of firecrackers?
Check out the sequence event type
If I wanted a sound by proximity, but, the player would have to break the proximity barrier to make it happen, Each Time

any reason why im not able to test spawn?
can t test in editor
Nah this is base game, not gonna get into map editing. It's for one of the F/A-26B missions I believe in the campaign

I know shift is the fast button (faster movement, rotation, etc.) of the cursor but is there also a slow button? I tried alt and ctrl. Ctrl seems to prevent the cursor from moving
Does anyone know why units arent following paths?
can you elaborate? units should be able to follow paths

Does anyone know why units arent following paths?

did you assign the units to their desired paths? either in defaultpath or as an action inside a trigger?

I have a tanker drone set to a path with t points so it just flies back and forth over 20 miles. I have that set as it's default path and I have it's behavior set to follow path. All it does is circle the first point. The path is on a loop. And it's 10,000ft altitude

I created a campaign for stable branch, then adjusted it for MP on public testing. The file extension changed by having MP added to the end. Apparently, the campaign for stable branch still gets overridden by the PT one, even with the different file extension. Has any one else experienced this, or knows how to remedy it?

That would be how I'd expect it to work. You'd need to make a copy of the campaign and work on that copy, if you want a version of how it was before you changed stuff
Got it thanks

I am on public testing and making a multiplayer mission. Also could it be the I start the drone too close to the path?
Also I have changed the speeds to 200kn initial and 275kn default
i am running on stable, so it might be that. you could increase the distance from the path or maybe the overlapping path might be the issue. you could also try making it a slightly elliptical path

Do we still need to be on public testing to do multiplayer custom missions?
afaik you do
dang

did you try sending path via event?
No it seemed unnecessary since it was set as default behavior but I will
Is there any way to change a multiplayer spawn point based on the completion of an objective? I kinda wanna try to make a push gamemode

Is there any way to change a multiplayer spawn point based on the completion of an objective? I kinda wanna try to make a push gamemode
no
I have also had issues relying on default behavior and have taken to just keeping it default none,parked and using an "init" immediate timer event that fires all the pathing/movement. You can't set default formation anyway so I end up having to do the init event regardless.

@ChadGatling  are you on PTB or main build ? I cant repro, my drone is following my path
I'm doing it on a MP mission. Which requires PT
oh I missed that, let me retry on my MP playground

might sound stupid, but maybe try  to check game file integrity in steam?
I verified game files and some need fixing but it still refuses to follow a path
Dang, I dont know then :/

can you send me your mission file?
I can check locally
Its uploaded if thats what you mean

ok , what the name?
Team Carrier ops Training
What kind of path is expect from the tanker ? so I know if it work or not on my side?

What kind of path is expect from the tanker ? so I know if it work or not on my side?
Should be following a heading of 033 for 20 miles
Then loop

did you try adding a 3rd point to your path?
i knew of some different game code that didnt work with 2 point path
Why would they have a 500m orbit?

Why would they have a 500m orbit?
ill try a third point
Yes but why? they are set to path

Yes but why? they are set to path
not sure,  but this is super weird behavior
Uploading now with more points

Did you make their default behavior to follow the path?
IIRC there is some issue with default behavior, most people found that making a timed event that fires immediately with stuff like setting paths works better
Ok so the 2 points path was the issues, having more point fixed it. Good to know.

so how do i define players spawning on a carrier?
if i have a carrier and the mission set for a specific plane, can they just spawn on it whenever?
If it’s anything like single player, you do it on the carrier unit’s settings

if i have a carrier and the mission set for a specific plane, can they just spawn on it whenever?
If it’s anything like single player, you do it on the carrier unit’s settings
There’ll be a tab at the top to assign planes to spots

Right but I can only spawn one player spawn despite being in the beta branch, I thought beta lets you make multiplayer compatible missions?
you have to make a special multiplayer campaign i believe
Eh. Sadly there is almost no interesting scenarios for long flights like in DCS... So I'll try to make one xd

any way to make enemy air units spawn at airfields and actually use them to take off?
can place them there manually but it does not seem to treat it any different as spawning in air
you need to order them to take off

if i add helicopters to a multi-role mission, does that prevent people without the dlc from playing even if they select a plane?
no
awesome

Is it me or does the IsLanded conditional not work properly?
It works for me. You have to slow down under 50 knots I believe and be within the radius of the specified waypoint
And be landed 😛

Maybe it's broken for the MP editor?
Maybe its the negation of it? I use it to test for players having taken off. I use Player Is Not Landed
I believe players start a little in the air, so it’s possibly triggering immediately

That was one of the issues I was having in the past

Do individual player objectives work for MP? Or you just have to have the same objectives that everyone sees? Or like individual takeoff objectives?
… is there a Takeoff objective type?
Regardless, I believe all objectives are team-based

… is there a Takeoff objective type?
Regardless, I believe all objectives are team-based
I mostly work with conditionals so By takeoff objective I just mean one that I make that is a takeoff objective and not a specific type of objective for take off. It was just an example

Oh we can't compare 2 global values to each other?
Huh. No, I don’t believe so
damn

You can just port over to MP?
yup
copy your mission into your mp campaign, before loading the game, edit the .vts to make sure Multiplayer = True and IsConfigurable = True. Then in editor remove the Player spawn and add your MP spawn. Voila

I am moving a MP over to SP. I named my campaign the same name as the mission. What do I need to copy over?
I just compared it to the missions
Superb new feature in the new version

is mp mission creating in the public testing yet?
yes
do ai wingmen work?

Do event sequences run in order and the exit condition must pass before the next Entry condition will be checked?
Yes
Or at least “I can come up with a way to read that that is true”

Anyone want to help me test my spawn trigger? You just have to spawn
I hate to ask such a newbie question, but I've had a bunch of tries at it, and cant seem to get the passenger pickup/drop off working. I have units boarding the VTOL but its not taking off and dropping off at the destination waypoint. Just the basic pick up and drop off. TIA.
Every Tuesday steam has a maintenance

Did you gave them a rally waypoint ? and you selected the unit that need to be dropped off? on the drop off objective
If I do a conditional triggered by a player in a MP mission is that just the host?
I can't figure out how to detect when a unit has taken of in MP

nvm

Do triggers only fire once?
correct
what you could do

Do I have to reload the game?
yes mission editor data stay loaded in memory
Another great fix : Mad4 radar / launcher can now be deployed , undeployed, for maximum randomness SAM site

Does it work by enabling then checking and disabling?
I think it is checked each frame, if global value = x continue
As long it is enabled

Do your global value start at 0?
yes
Its a trigger that trigger on conditionnal?

Its a trigger that trigger on conditionnal?
@Hoizen  yes I did non required objective that I enable to let player know how much life they have (using MP death). But if we can manipulate team score a bit further I would also use that.
So I could just have the objective activate on conditionnal.

Hey how do I make a mission end when an airbase changes teams?
Airbases change teams when you tell them to, so end the mission at the same time, I guess
yes its checking for global variably equals 0

Does it Need to follow a Take Off with an Altitude to actually complete the action?
They’ll firm up in the order you placed them
First one down/assigned the the group will be lead

How do I put the player in an air group btw?
With NPCs
The same way you put npcs in a group

@Skumby any idea why it wouldn't show?
Multiplayer?
Yeah

fr? so no AI wingmen
Guess not
that sucks

Off the wall, has anyone had issues in MP where an event is shown differently between players? I have a rocket arty salvo hitting an area, i see the rounds go where they are supposed to, however, my friend sees them engaging us and hitting us (but i do not) The hits do register too (damage me and him)
hm I use Arty on shot waypoint but I never saw has a client perspective, so I dont know
Am I dumb or was there a drone carrier? Am I blind? Should I stop drinking?

Am I dumb or was there a drone carrier? Am I blind? Should I stop drinking?
I think it got removed
is there any way for bomber to attack way points instead of units etc?

is there any way for bomber to attack way points instead of units etc?
for a runway attack for example
Appreciate it. Made some changes and still seems to be an issue. As host, the arty does attack the players, but the other players see it attacking them and me (both get damaged) definitely strange. More messin around with it hopefully

Maybe baha wants a new aircraft for team B rather than reskinned team A's one?
Tho would be nice in general to put any unit on either team
MAD-4's for everyone!

does earning money during the mission from completing objectives not work when launching from the editor kind of like the base budget doesn't? i was trying to balance my mission out and wasn't seeing the rewards
Good question, is there a way to see available money in mission?
when you land and rearm

Good question, is there a way to see available money in mission?
when you land and rearm
I'm not even sure you get paid for completing objectives during the mission. It might only be applied to the campaign cap after you're done

.yes if you set the reward on kill right?
I'm not seeing it added when I land and rearm
ahhhhh

does the mission editor open outside of VR? I don't think I'd last long trying to make a whole mission in VR..
It’s not in vr
opens on my pc?

Another newbie question. Whats the trick to being able to REPAIR when landing at a refuel/repair pad? I land, it allows me to reload, refuel, but not repair. Oddly.
(And I learned the chopper is capable of limping home with 1 blade broken in half, and Another clipped off at tip! was shocked!
Repairing can be disabled by the scenario author, so it might be that

Where is that in the editor?
I didnt see a switch to allow / dsallow
Bottom right of the scenario options, iirc

Another question as I prepare my first campaign. When uploading to Steam, does it take Only the items used in the mission/Campaign, or, does it upload Everything in the work folder? Unused sounds etc?
It only uploads the stuff that the mission uses
Wicked, thats what I thought, just didnt want to upload a ton of junk. Thanks.

Is the wiki correct that carriers top out at 15 m/s?
seems about right
close to slow vehicle at 10 M/s

Is there anyway to make it so the allied cruiser uses its forward vertical launched missiles to target specific threats such as an infantry on the ground? Or is it possible to make it so it attacks specific air targets which are landed..?
You may be able to assign it as a Priority target?
Unit, then (pick the unit), then- Action - Assign Priority Target - Pick the target

You may be able to assign it as a Priority target?
Unit, then (pick the unit), then- Action - Assign Priority Target - Pick the target
Doesn't it fire a radar guided missile? I don't think it can track a ground target. The allied cruiser has a cannon on the bow though, might try using that. Not sure what kind of range it has

I don't think I can do this, but is there any way to create an event that will add fuel to the players vehicle?  Or is the only way the player can refuel is to go through the comms menu in their MFD?
To clarify, this is for the AH-94, not in air refueling.

If go back to the main branch for my game install I assume I just need to make sure I don't try to open up any of my mp/public_testing stuff in the old (stable) version of the game right?  There aren't any other gotchas that I need to worry about when switching back and forth are there?
Not sure what'd happen. You'd likely be fine even opening them, as long as you don't save. It'd possibly crash, but that wouldn't corrupt your content
If I host a MP game in the public_testing branch and I choose my custom MP mission from the steam workshop, will others that try to join my game automatically download the custom mission?  I want to do some beta testing with friends today and want to make sure I give them the right instructions/expectations.

yeah they will be prompted if they want to download it
Cool Thanks @Strikeeaglechase

Paolo, is there a Media Kit to be DL somewhere? I need the BD PNG logo for the briefing screens and cant find one on either website or off google (other than the 320 rez version) - got a link for that somewhere I'm missing?
what like this?
Ya, thats the lil one

How would I set a friendly air group to loiter until the player forms up on them? I have a part of my mission where the player is to escort a SEAD team to an enemy airbase, but I'm not sure how to prevent the SEAD team from moving toward the objective until the player is actually in the air. I currently have the player air group and SEAD air group separated.
Order them to circle a waypoint where you want them to wait
and when the player enters a radius nearby, they go to their next objective/form up on the player/whatnot

Is that something I would add through the event tab? I tried to add a sequenced event where they orbit until the flight group meets up with them, but they would always fly straight to the objective. Although, it could be that my radius is too large.
did you set up the conditions properly?
mind sending a screenshot?

did you set up the conditions properly?

I'm not sure haha. I'm very new to the editor.

Is the first picture the entry or exit conditional?
Let me double check real quick
It’s the exit condition

Ok cool, thanks! And in the unit configuration tab for the SEAD group, should I set default behavior to orbit to prevent them from going to the path right off the bat?
Then set an event group for following the path after the exit condition is met?
one moment

Then set an event group for following the path after the exit condition is met?

spawn them as TakeOff

Can you spawn a unit or group at a specific waypoint with an event? Or is the only option random with the alt spawns?
You could just have a lot of duplicates of those craft at all the possible spawn points
Yeah I thought about that but assumed it would be resource intensive. Also, a pain in the ass

On that same topic, what about an unspawned ship containing a player spawn point. Or a ship containing a spawn point getting destroyed. What happens? Will the slot selection in the briefing room appear/ disappear to reflect availability?
maybe? That's a good question
I recommend you test it, and update us too please

That might be a while. I'm still in the ideas stage. Also, I need maps to facilitate my ideas.

Do events that trigger radio message actions work in the public_testing MP stuff yet?  I tried to set one up and it wasn't working.  Just wondering if I need to do something special to get those to work, or just wait.
it works
Hmmm I got no audio in my MP mission with this.  And I've succsssfully done radio messages in other non MP missions I have worked on.

@BahamutoD just so i know i'm not going crazy, are radio messages supported yet for MP missions in public_testing?  I've tried both play message and play team message actions and I'm just not getting any of them to play
@Steakfest  add a 7 sec delay before playing your audio
the event start immediatly even tho you might not be yet in the world yet (after you press enter)

I've tried every possible combination I can think of.  Timed Events, Sequence Events, Objectives, I can not for the life of me get an audio file to play over the radio in this MP mission.  @L etranger can you confirm that you have successfully gotten a radio message to play in the public testing branch on a multiplayer enabled mission?  In these screenshots,  I have an event sequence "Intro Sequence" that is triggered by an initial timed event.  I know the timed event is working, because the objective gets started as expected.  I even tried to play the audio as events from the objective start and that wouldn't play either.
I do have audio working properly.
if you preview your file it does play in editor; correct?

if you preview your file it does play in editor; correct?
your scripting looks good
Yep, plays just fine, and I don't have problems with audio on the main branch of the editor with my single player stuff.  Only seem to be having trouble here on public_testing with multiplayer

did you converted your mission into mp?
I ran into an issue where a ressource audio was missing from my .vts file, and it was making any radio to fail to play.
one ogg missing from the mission ressources would make none of them play

@Steakfest  nor host or client can hear the radio; correct?
I was only testing on the host.
did you try with a different ogg file?

did you try with a different ogg file?
how do you mark a mission as multiplayer?
is it on the workshop or in the editor

how do you mark a mission as multiplayer?
is it on the workshop or in the editor
you first have to be on public testing and then select a campaign and you should see the tick box

is it only for campaigns?
sadly yes
The "campaign" is really just a folder you lump all the missions you want into. So players selecting missions when they make a lobby dont have to scroll through a long list.

Was your radio volume in the cockpit turned up?
Yes. Volume was maxed out for all dials.
@Baconism  I have a technique where if you’re firing at a line of targets you can fire a dozen rockets, then slew the laser across the line right before impact to hit all of the targets

would you mind sharing your mission folder? I could test on my end
Anyone know how many hits of each munition type it takes to sink carriers and cruisers (both teams)?  And does hitting a component such as radar or cwis count against the ship?
I think 4 /5 agm65?  but that a good question for the wiki

No idea about blufor stuff

Sea groups seem to always make an arrowhead formation. Is there any determinate way to know which position each ship will take in the formation? It doesn't seem to correlate to the order units are added to the group.
check actions in events there might be a formation for ships
Actually, it might be ordering them from right to left. Have to run it a few times to see.

@L etranger FYI, I tried other ogg files that have worked just fine, and still no audio.  I also added some tutorial text to the same events so I could be certain my events were all firing and i'm seeing the tutorial text, but something is preventing these radio messages from playing...    Did you happen to attempt to load the mission and see if you heard anything?
To try to debug this audio issue i'm having, I have a question...  When I download from the steam workshop a campaign that I created and uploaded, where does the downloaded version of the campaign go?  I assume those files end up in a different spot than the ones I'm editing with the editor.  So where can I go to see the files after they've made the round trip up and down from steam so I can see if there is something missing, (like an ogg file)
Found this I think...   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\...........

So, even found the downloaded steam workshop files and all the audio files are there, they just won't play in the mission...

I think radio volume on the cockpit knob also impact mission comm?
All volumes knobs are all the way up…. Hearing all multiplayer comms.

do you have an antivirus?

dunno man this is weird

When I started up the game I expected to have to create a new pilot, since the save data was gone, etc, (along with the other settings)  but I did not have to do that.  (must use steam cloud to recover that stuff?)  Anyway, when I started my mission from the steam workshop, it worked as expected...
Saves are in app data/roaming
Glad to hear man

Or the game ogg reader got busted? If that can be a thing?
except i would think that would have gotten fixed by previous reinstall/verify ops I had done...
so now my install is very clean, none of my custom maps, scenarios, campaigns are in those folders, as expected but I can move those back in from my backup.   But what's weird is the "SaveData" folder that had those gameSettings, inputbinding, etc...   are no longer there.  maybe there is a difference with public testing where those are now in appdata but they weren't before?  Because I haven't tried installing the older version.  Maybe @BahamutoD moved SaveData from the "install dir" to the "AppDir/Roaming" in this public_testing branch, and maybe something I did caused some jank between them and somehow broke audio.  I can think of one thing I might have done to my pilots.cfg file by hand, and that would have been to swap the order of the pilots, because my primary pilot wasn't the firset one in the list anymore and I was getting tired of constantly clicking through the list to get to it during my testing.   I don't know for sure if I made that change right before testing the audio in my mission or not though, so certainly not a smoking gun, but definitely a lead.  And I don't know where I made that change either, because I never saw that file in two different places until just now so I couldn't tell you where I first found it.

going to now switch to main branch, test, and then switch back to see if it all still works.
then carefully put my custom content back into the directories so I can go into the editor.

how does capturing work? destroying all enemies in an area?
Correct
If Im in the TADS using the targeting sight what is that - RADAR - TGP - TSD or ARAD? I want to flip a event when the player targets something, but not sure which is which here. TIA

is TSD the targeting sight display on screen in the cockpit? The TADS display? That would be my optimal choice.
TGP is the only thing that would make sense. I wonder if ground radar = radar for that purpose

For anyone who cares, sea groups do actually form up based on the order units are added to the group.  Examples:  If you have a sea group of 5 units, `A B C D E`  They will form up like so: ``` |   |   | A |   |   | |   | B |   | C |   | | D |   |   |   | E |```  This group of 5, `C B D A E`  Will make this formation: ``` |   |   | C |   |   | |   | B |   | D |   | | A |   |   |   | E |```

I've set the player to spawn on a cruiser, cold start, but their landing gear is up? Watup wit dat
┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)
😔

Did you place the player on the cruiser, or did you assign the player to the cruiser?
I placed it just over it
lol, that explains it

Ohh thanks, it wont lock on a dead unit will it? I've mastered flying, not the targeting yet hahah
(RedElite, thanks, I wasnt sure which it was in the selection menu)
Pretty sure you can’t lock dead targets

If I have a Campaign and a single Scenario under that Campaign, If I wanted to create a clone of the Scenario in the same Campaign I would think I would do the following:  * Duplicate the directory * change the directory name to something different * Change the name of the .vts file to match the new directory name * Change the Scenarioid in the .vts file to match * Open in Editor  I did all that and got this dialog, so what step might I be missing?
Maybe I need to change campaignOrderIdx too?
I think that was it, Not getting the dialog anymore

What does Detection Mode =  Force Undected do?    Does it stop units from getting the red and blue indicators around them when they're seen?

What does Detection Mode =  Force Undected do?    Does it stop units from getting the red and blue indicators around them when they're seen?
It prevents the craft from being able to be seen by enemies
so if the enemy is a human player, it doesn't really have an effect?

so if the enemy is a human player, it doesn't really have an effect?
force undetected is for example hidding an Allied AI unit from showing on the map
for search and rescure or surprise mf scenario

If a unit diverts from a path, is it because it's engaging something?
Certainly a possibility
They’re also not a fan of flying into the ground

Rail paths or regular paths?
Ground units will always follow paths
reg paths

Does Rail Path circumvent the group behavior? And if so, do path events work if they're set to that behavior? This would save me sooooo much time
Nothing circumvents group behaviour
Not even waypoint events?

Is there a trick to getting Ground units to follow a path? I have paths laid out, both on the surface level and a foot above(Just in case the surface was a factor in them not working), I have Soldiers, set to Path, or Railpath, or Follow, and then set to the selected path, and nada. Set it as an action in an event, nothing, its odd. I can get them to move to waypoints, but not just walk a patrol path. Happy Friday, thanks for all the help this week, almost got things to 100%
using an event is the "correct" way
or rather, the way that should work

Is it in a group?
Yes
it is, in a large group that Isnt on the path

How is the Leader designated?
that fits to the Follow function Im sure
first spawned in the group.

is there a way to play custom missions using multiplayer?
oh ok
are you on public testing

I don't suppose there is any way to do a comparison in the conditional editor to a global value, or some other variable is there?  I want to do some conditional logic that doesn't compare itself to just a constant value if possible...
I don't see how that compares team a kills to a global value.
It only triggers if both the kill count and the variable are equal

Can you only use visual scripting?
For the mission editor? Yeah
Is there any plans to change that

For the mission editor? Yeah
Is there any plans to change that
No public ones

wdym? Its all visual based
what interprets the blocks
The underlying logic is written in C#

so if typescript bad, then C# bad?
Typescript isn't javascript
take a step back and write it in C

does brainfuck count as high level?
no
I have no experience with brainfuck, but if it exists and is well documented...

so about as good as whitespace?
yep
you only need an 2 incrementors, RAM and a comparison engine

wait you can write mission scripting in notepad??
You can edit the .VTS files to Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V parts that would be too repetitive to do in the editor
^

then you'd just directly edit the VTS no?
If I was doing it manually yeah
no

Looking at events and actions, is there a way to end the mission?  Or do I need to complete an objective that's marked as final to do that?
You need to complete all objective that are marked mandatory for completion
if none are present, the moment the scenario is loaded, it counts as won (not sure how it's handled in MP)

maybe the host skipped the mission without you knowing?
or everyone just pressed respawn
That too

How come some older missions on workshop complete at a seemingly arbitrary objective?
*shrug*
There may be other ways to complete a mission, but that's the way I know

Tropical? Where do you find this? I just checked in PT too and only found Boreal, Desert and Arctic. Am I missing someting?
Decompiling revealed it, hand editing the map file used it
Sick! let me test it.

The scenario editor for MP shows the same tooltip for "score/kill" and "score/death" that it shows for "Budget".  Does that mean that the points earned for kills / deaths is added to the budget, or is that just a copy/paste bug?   I want to use kills/deaths to come up with a scoring system for a multiplayer map, but not if it just ads to the budget that each team has.  (I don't want to limit rearming costs)
I suspect it’s a copy/paste bug
Yeah it is

And followup question.  if I wanted to award 20 points for a kill and subtract 10 points for a death, do i have to put in -10?  or is it already implied that the deaths are a negative.
Thanks @Skumby and @Strikeeaglechase
Thanks again!

If someone drops from the game, I assume their score is retained, so using score vs. kills makes for a better winning condition if you're worried about someone losing 1/2 their team late in the game to dropped connections, or just having to leave in general?
Thanks for the Pathing Info yesterday guys, got it all working last night.
Everyone here has been super cool and super helpful, just straight up answers, and its let me keep building and tightening up my campaign. Still trying to figure out the "TADS Target on the ground to flip a switch, but almost there. The node for the LockTarget can be left at None...so Ill try to get that to cause a positive, perhaps just Using the TGP is enough, or, I was thinking perhaps if its targeted and then the "Using Weapon" tag might be enough to lock it and flip it? If so, whats the "short hand" for a Hellfire? AGM-114?

OMG thank you! I had no idea and didnt want to send it blind, Ill try that today, thanks so much

Here's a question thats on my mind. What is the green Ring that locks onto a target called? When you actual pull the trigger to "Lock ON" with a missile? but have not let the missile loose yet...when you get the tone to fire...what is that called? Id like a trigger when That happens, not when the targeting reticlue first snaps to it on the TADS display. Does that have a different name? Is that function the TSD? Hope everyones having a great weekend, Thank you for the info on how to run the complete mission Including the briefing, was my first time after a few weeks learning and work, really cool to see it all as one piece.
I don’t believe that’s an option either
Huh! Dang! Interesting tho. Thanks, there are a few selections in that drop down, I know RADAR and TGD, the other 2 I dont know yet

IF I wanted to re-use a map, for a new Mission, within a Campaign, do I need to re-save the map or something other than just deleting all the actions and such and Save As with the new missions name?
Map or scenario?
Ummm Scenario, I want to re-use the map, with the towns and roads Ive made. Thats where I am a lil comfused. Last night then I loaded thru the Custom Scenarios, I was all of them, versions and such, all under the map I made, I expect that will be a no no when uploading it, and hence I thought to ask

When I am in the Mission editor, the name in the upper right is the Map in use?
Yes, and I made that in the map editor
The scenario has all the units and events and objectives

can I do that and have it be used as the next mission base?
Sure. Use Save As.
Ok killer

@L etranger did the single scenario have the exact same id/name/foldername as the one within the campaign?
just the same foldername as the one in the campaign
I restored the single scenario from the bin to double check, and yes the radio is gone

stupid question: hows a fella make a multiplayer mission. do i need a mod? ive made single missions before but i don't see how to make it multiplayer
You have to be in the public testing branch right now. Make a campaign and check the multiplayer box
got it, is there a way to let players select which airframe they want to fly? as opposed to just forcing everyone into one airframe per mission?

damn...

Using public testing branch v1.3.6p2 using multiplayer lobby, any time I ask my wingmen to form up, the KC-49 and E-4 Overlord decide to form up as well.  The larger planes seem to lack the property of "set player commands" within triggers and in their own settings in the mission editor, unless I'm missing something i can change elsewhere?
They're not really meant to be used as wingmen. Nor do I think wingmen are even supported in multiplayer atm
wait your telling me I can fly in formation wih the E4 and KC-49 :risitas:

I took it out of the campaign folder. I am working on it in the standalone mission editor
Make sure in the vets file it's not set to a campaign

What's the condition to finish that objective? It might be getting completed immediately, or not have an objective, or be completed before it's even triggered
The mission ends when the player completes the last active objective. I suspect you’re starting an objective in the On Complete actions of a previous objective.  There’s going to be the briefest of moments between the two when there’s no active objective, so the mission completes
Use the PreReq start type to chain objectives like that

And the follow behaviour whats that?
I've never got it to do anything
okay

Yeah, triggers

Is there a way to complete an objective where the condition is no enemy unit alive in a certain radius?
Unitlist > not any near waypoint
oh nice thanks

ok, something i'm confused about.  Does the game have any collision detection between players in multiplayer?  obvioiusly we've seen no collisions in our free-flight and air show missions.  But is that something that can be changed?  Or does the multiplayer engine just not support that yet?

Will every body get the Message Displayed or is this the way to display the message locally?  I would like that if a new player, who could not read the briefing, gets a small info, as soon as he turns on the battery. The question is whether everyone gets the message or only the one who just flipped the battery switch.
everybody will get it
sad

Is there a feature request channel? I think the ability to read the briefing as someone who joins late is a feature that benefits a large percentage of players.
public  testing or vtorldev
yeah this would be very useful for custom missions when people start joining new ones in the middle of a match

There’s no button to request to control briefing when the mission is in progress?
Sounds like it’s useful
Once the mission starts the screen switches to the scoreboard and wont go back

Do some units have more of a performance hit? E.g radars have more complex logic load  Mostly wondering cos I've played a few missions with not great performance but in my own messing around I can place quite a lot of units without issue  Is it certain units? Other game logic/scripting etc? Or is it to do with projectiles in the air etc

How do you convert a singleplayer mission to MP and add it to a campaign?
multiplayer = True in the vts file
then copy your mission into your campaign

how do I do the second bit?
just find your campaign folder here

stupid question, how do you start a AH-94 multiplayer mission?
click multiplayer, host a game, choose a mission that has the AH-94 in it

click the Betas tab

Okay cool! now to play it with friends do they need to be in the testbranch aswell?
yes
cool

Now how do i convert the mission to multiplayer?

i've yet to get around to making a MP mission myself yet, so I'm afraid that's about as far as I can help you, lol beyond what I've seen discussed in the channel already

how do I move actions in nodes?
I need to move an action to the top
@Ethans there is a gray box that you can grab onto to drag things, but I think there are some contexts where the order you place things can't be changed, or maybe doesn't matter.

Was it ever addressed if MP missions actually support multi-vehicle missions, like the Air Show missions currently do?
like 2 AH-94s, some F/A-26s and F-45s?
throw in an AV-42C for the fun of it

like 2 AH-94s, some F/A-26s and F-45s?
throw in an AV-42C for the fun of it
yea this is possible, you can put any vehicle you want as a MP spawn, it even lets you select the amount of slots per AH-94 if you just don't want a gunner

Is there a way to preset a list of gps points or nav points so they are populated in the gps on mission start? I'm wanting the player to be able to select any point on the list at any time to be able to activate navigation to it. I know I could do it with a bunch of generic objectives and waypoints but that will get confusing with regular objectives.
Yup. You can send gps points in an action. Think it’s in the system category
I created a PlayBGM event on the editor screen when I was creating a multi-mission. I selected a song and clicked on the speaker symbol to test, but the background music does not play. Is this test function broken now?

mp3 or ogg?
tbh it was always kind broken, restart the game and try again

@L etranger @Freedomplaza  I saved the game, restarted it, and tried both mp3 and ogg, but the test play button for background music doesn't seem to work... Is there any other way I can try?
double check your audio is set right
it may have switched to your vr headset

does anyone know how to add a smoke grenade effect in the mission editor?
I also can't get an AI tank to follow a path. I set it to path, follow and railpath (and honestly have no clue what the difference between them, the wiki has no information about these settings). I have the default path set to the path I made and it still refuses to move
Is it part of a group?

Is it part of a group?
Well there aren’t any smoke grenades but you can always use a flare using action
I feel incredibly stupid, lol. I searched this channel to see if I could find the issue and I was pretty sure I never assigned the tank a group, and I guess I did

Is there a way to giv e the player an ability to trigger a trigger from the comms page?
LIke, where I create a custom comms group like "support" and have a command in comms for them to call in arty or whatever
Well you could use the “mfd-bottom-1” as a condition

Is the "reward" a monetary reward that gets added to their budget for buying future weapons?
I believe it's only at the end of the mission, or at least that's how it works in single player
Thanks!

Like, pull the map from GTA San Andreas, and import it into VTOL VR?
yes someone can, and that someone should be you
the map editor is free to be used by all

I might be missunderstanding something im reading, but it looks like they should be able to kill bunkers?
I thought so, too.
Bunkers have a minimum damage of 150, tanks deal 151 damage

Where are you getting those numbers?
yeah should be able to then
"naughty methods"

okay so how many hps does a bunker have?
150
150

unless min damage is subtracted?
Well, I let some tanks have a go at it for a while and they didn't make any progress.
what's the min damage for the allied bunker?

what's the min damage for the allied bunker?
no?
iv heard recent reports that bunkers might be a bit buggy with when they take damage

Wanna report that chase, or should I?
you can
500lb will

is this table of damage values and stuff posted anywhere?
None exists rn
I'd be a big help for map making to know what kind of performance to expect from what units

is it possible to launch a mission from the editor without headset and with a dev camera? I just wanna see if far away units are doing what I think
you can have dev camera, im not sure if you need a headset for it tho
how do you use dev camera?

how do you use dev camera?
press insert on your keyboard
then use brackets

does it include modded weapons?
temperz I bet literally every weapon in nbda can kill bunkers because boris told you to give it a lot of damage
aim280 cannot

ummm wat? Hydras can't kill bunkers. That's why I didn't list them
oh
your list is confusing

anyone know the ranges on the radars? wiki says 55k range on the S/A but im pretty sure i was being picked up at around 65k over open water
hmm.. anyone know if i could take screenshots inside mission editor without all those overlays, like it would be in-game.. ?
could just crop em in MS paint

hmm.. anyone know if i could take screenshots inside mission editor without all those overlays, like it would be in-game.. ?

i mean, the cursor, the 'ghost' buildings and names etc

What aircraft are you flying?
Oh god imagine if the enemy military was willing to destroy buildings in order to win
Level the city with you in it

If you want to be scrubby, you can launch a 145 from 45nm away if you climb to 55k ft and exceed mach? I forget the speed, but quite fast
Cruise missiles would 100% be my solution to the MAD-4 on an oil platform problem. XD
On flat ground you'd have a very tough time. Your only chance would be to get the missile to climb up then get under and notch it once it pitbulls

So if you topple the platform the units on top will float there and still be active?
*Can* you actually topple an oil platform in VTOL VR?
Yes

*Can* you actually topple an oil platform in VTOL VR?
Yes
Hit any 2 legs with an agm or bomb

My rockets just arent launching, what am I doing wrong? I have a proxy trigger thats going off, the rockets are standing up, I have a list of Added Priority targets, but, no launching. theres a Radar selected thats active and has Engage enemies selected as well. Very odd, Ive tried a few ways to Sunday on it, and have to return to ask. TIA.
if its rocket artillery, you have to give a fire order on a waypoint, and it wont need a radar if its a SAM site, please stop calling them rockets, its confusing
MAD-4

I am stumped. I created a mission in the public testing for multiplayer. I did a small play test with some friends. I hosted it, we all joined like normal. We started it, it would go solid for 1 min. Then whoever hosted (we rotated after it happened the first time) would crash. Full crash, game would end, doesn’t even end with a bit responding. I have no idea what’s happening, anyone have any idea? (It’s a standard 16 player mission)
I would recommend sending your player.log
To get your player.log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows Key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: %appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log". 4. Upload this file into #public_testing, or whatever channel you are asked to do so in.

Im sure this has been asked, is there a way to make multiple aircraft available to be chosen in the editor?
Yes
the MP editor allows you to do that

Do airbases come with free refuel/rearm spots?  Or do I have to place all of the spots individually?
And for pathing, do units always go to the first path node? Can I put the AI anywhere along a loop and they will follow it?
Airbases come with refuel/rearm points in all the hangars and the landing pads

And for pathing, do units always go to the first path node? Can I put the AI anywhere along a loop and they will follow it?

The AI will start following the path at the closest point to where they spawn

i started making a mission on a workshop map, is it possible to convert it to MP? I can't load it after moving it i guess because I don't have unencrypted map files
okay I think I just needed to copy the map folder up a level
If a player is detected, are they always detected? Or can a player go back to undetected if they manage to evade sensors for sometime? can you hide from the AI i guess lol

If a player is detected, are they always detected? Or can a player go back to undetected if they manage to evade sensors for sometime? can you hide from the AI i guess lol
In the past, the answer was “yes”, but it’s become more nuanced with the rise of multiplayer and respawning
we can ignore respawns for the moment  I was making a mission where the objective is to capture multiple airbases, I've been forgiving with radar placement so that there is ways to the fields avoiding detection. I've got planes that launch when the player is detected and within in range, but I suppose after knocking the first field, the plane takeoff event will always fire I did try have a look see if I could do detected by [unit] but couldn't see it

Can you do repeatable missions?   I am thinking of an RTS style system where you have trucks go to a "resource location" and back to the base, providing some money each trip
s t o n k s
the answer is no, yukari from touhou project

CFTs push it up to what like 13k?
CFTs do refuel as its counted as "internal"
I want to say 20 000L

6400 + 4200 + 4200 + 4200 right?
wait no
I dunno

why is the AGM 89 more expensive than the AGM 161?
@ baha game breaking bug here
does the entire team have a budget in vtol?

does the entire team have a budget in vtol?
no lol
i want 4 a side competitive refueling

so whos making it? I will if no one will in 4 days exactly
how many refuel planes do we allow tho? one per team?
yes

how many refuel planes do we allow tho? one per team?
yes
161 technically has a TFR so its more advanced than a regular AGM but still not as complex as the 89

also do we do bedwars rules?
i will play this mission with you when its complete
wat

whats the min altitude for the tanker?
With what weapons
Lmao

@ierdna100 is the ASF carrier functional now?
can enemy player rearm on it
VTOL RTS also sounds great but I need to find a way to implement it  Resource obtaining workers  Ability to buy new units, like a mission with a -15000 reward that spawns a ground unit

any changes to be made?
1 u s d
no, perfect

Is hit by an AGM 89 a condition?
it could be
it is not

you can tell SAMs not to engage missiles right?
only in Unity
ah

can you sell starting fuel?
huh
I thought we could stop that

cant we just spawn them with very low fuel?
I assumed we could, never had a reason to
We could

Is there a respawn delay we could use?
noe
Make it more efficient by far to just fly to the tanker

Can you sell fuel in ext tanks?
only in CFTs
I think

how tf are you even going to die?
no more spawns
I guess running out of fuel but thats on you

(Much of discussion went into a group chat)  In any case, how can I give both sides equal carriers?
It seems allied and enemy have different carriers
Would be nice to be able to set a fuel consumption rate for a mission. Fuel is a useless mechanic since it never runs low in the course of a normal mission.

what about F/A-26B Naval Strike?
I'm not sure if I have done that one off the top of my head. I have done all the included missions tho
baha comms > tanker > call tanker to current position

Query of the day gents. If I had a Convoy of trucks, as a Objective, is there a way to take the waypoint location of the entire group? So, if one was killed, the way point would just shift to another in the group? Thanks as always.
just guessing, but you MIGHT be able to set a bunch of triggered events? start the waypoint on the first. if he's killed, set waypoint to 2nd one. dunno if it'll work if the 2nd one is killed, THEN the 1sts.
Not that I know of

Can someone make a Ghost of Kyiv campaign?  I would make it but I don’t know how.
Too soon imo
Feels a bit disrespectful

you want to fly on this map?
lol wow the actual twin towers
fuck no

just gonna say how sick would it be to have a "ghost of kyiv" mission? first ace in the 21st century if the story is real.
first ace in a day since ww2
It's a bit early for that kind of stuff

is it wrong for wanting to get handed the vr stick to a drone in this conflict? sounds like some good irl fun without the conequence of dying.
seriously tho, imagine if a country produed so many drones that it could afford to just let random untraind citiens that have basic simulator experience, fly them from their home computers
talk about chaos

The fuck is wrong with you?
lmao sorry but id love to vr control an armed drone for ukraine rn
Russian, Ukrainian or whatever, these are real people with real lives

ok may i reinterperate drones as UAV's?
That's the same thing
"Global Hawk is a high-altitude, long-endurance, unmanned aerial reconnaissance system.” High-resolution sensors, including visible and infrared electro-optical systems and synthetic aperture radar, will conduct surveillance over an area of 40,000nm² to an altitude of 65,000ft"

soyou think when im talking ARMED DRONES that it isnt a combat aircraft?
An armed drone could be a DJI Mini 2 with a firework launcher attached to it
and if its armed i assume you dont give a fuck about rules

you realie iwe wouldnt be shootinging at people, just UAVs, right? lol
Maybe that’s what you are saying now, that’s not what you said
Maybe get to know some of the peoples who lives have been permanently destroyed or ruined due to the things they’ve witnessed or experienced and you’ll be a little more stable

Is there any way to set the event radius to be a plane or 0alt? I would like an event to trigger when the player lands to pick up some homies
use conditional trigger with 'player has landed' AND 'player inside x metres of waypoint' does that work, or i'm missing something
that works, thanks

Does the action "Destroy" remove a unit instantly or just set-it-on-fire destroy it?
the second one
Awesome, that's what I need

Is it possibly to develop missions using 2 different computers? I e working on on pc then picking up on a laptop when I’m away from the pc?
Yup. You'll need to work out some way to transfer the mission folder across
Possible? Sure. Giant pain in the ass? Yes.

Possible? Sure. Giant pain in the ass? Yes.
Thanks for the replies. I could end up damaging/corrupting  the mission files one way or the other that’s the risk I suppose.
Just create a copy or back up and put it in another folder.

Is the campaign file bigger than 100mb?
hey guys, I'm getting the issue of where the player spawns in with the gear up at the air base. Doesn't matter if its set to cold start or flight ready. anyone know how to fix this?
are you 100% sure they are on the ground?

what do events do? compared to objectives
They can both cause Actions to happen. Events don’t have entries in the OBJ mfd page, and have varied triggering criteria. Never really thought about it this way tbh, but they’re pretty similar
Events are used to make stuff happen that’s not directly tied to an objective

I guess what I really want to know is, if I want to make aircraft spawn after I take off, can that be done with an objective?
Probably, but depending on the context, I’d possibly use a triggered event
alright

Can I just check (I'm an experienced mission editor prior to MP) to make a MP scenario, all I have to do is make it part of a multiplayer campaign and then in each scenario I need to create multiple "MP spawn" units for each side, nothing else unique to an MP scenario over a SP one, right?
The "player" object is largely useless now I assume; do I need to include it somewhere anyway or can I leave it out? And if I leave enemy MP spawn points out am I effectively creating a PvE (collaborative) mission or *must* I include them?
correct

except if you reference player in any conditional to replace it via multiple mp spawns you need for

Tell us about this function. How does ''AI SPAWNS'' function with respect to the player's spawn position? Also, is it possible to set a respawn position separate from the initial spawn position if, for example, the situation changes and the respawn position needs to be changed?
Huh, never seen that used for a player spawn before. Only with AI. I don't think player spawns can be changed mid-mission though, no. I haven't gone through all the options in the events though, so I might be wrong.
It is not possible to change the location of a spawnpoint mid-mission, but the alternate spawn feature allows you to assign a weight to multiple positions of the same spawn, so let's say you have 3 spawns in 3 locations over an airfield so the player never respawns at the same spot with the following settings:  ``` MP Spawn 1:   - Position 1, weight: 50   - Position 2, weight: 150   - Position 3, weight: 150 ```  The player is most likely to spawn at position 2 and 3, given the weight is the biggest (at 43% (150 / (150 + 150 + 50)) while he only has a chance of 14% to spawn at position 1

can you destroy  bridges?
No
I assume when you add the spawn points to a carrier that has alternative spawns, regardless of which it chooses, the spawns follow it?

I didn't test it yet, just curious if anyone has tried it
Quick question, if a trigger event fails a required objective, Will the mission fail completely?

Quick question, if a trigger event fails a required objective, Will the mission fail completely?
Yes.
I've seen missions that simulate it by placing things like storage tents or bunkers ON the bridge, or right at the legs. blow those up and you've blown up the bridge

if I fine tune a map, what will happen to the missions using that map? will it get updated?
Not unless you update them
There’s a Repack Map option in the mission editor menus

fine adjustments in some mountains wont crash the mission right?
Nope
mountains look very weird.. also some water edges are very squared

In the public testing branch: how do you create an AWACS for the red team?
I'm not seeing a way to spawn one in the editor.
You can do it by modifying the VTS file but im not sure if thats a good idea

that's what the dev did for the coop missions?
theres prob a reason its hidden in the editor
ok, thanks.

Does anyone know if i can make a mission today and later convert it to a multiplayer mission once we are able to make those? Or will i have to start all over again on release?
well you can make a mission and convert it into a multiplayer mission through the vts files.
Also we can already make multiplayer missions in public_test beta so you could just start off with a mp mission to begin with.

Is there an easier way to test mp missions than uploading, subscribing, leaving the editor, then hosting the game (possibly with a game reboot if the upload was an update)?
i dont think there is yet
make your mission in SP then when it works convert to MP

aight, so due to the need to upload to the workshop to test a mp mission, theres a lot of missions that are broken or WIP, anyone got a few reccomendations for co op MP missions?
if you want to test an mp mission sadly you have to upload it. but you can always unlist or private it.
How many pilots?

unrelated, anyone know how the "is detected" conditional works? im trying to have a bunch of fighters launch after the player is detected and i cant get them to work right
is it a problem with the condition or a problem with the launching? I tend to have trouble getting AI fighters to launch from the ground, so a lot of times I just spawn them right into the air if it's not right in front of the player
theyre launching from the ground and a carrier. i don't think its a problem with them launching but to trigger the event itself

its either launching them right at the very beiginning of the mission, or not at all

What methods are you using to detect the player? What's around that will see them?
i want it to literally just be any radar
do i need to specify which radars?

do i need to specify which radars?
shouldn't. are the radars on?
yup

shouldn't. are the radars on?
yup
hang on imma go fuck with it

Questions about AI fighters. ''PlayerCommands''. ・UnitGroupOnly ・ForceAllow ・ForceDisallow and ''DetectionMode'' settings, what actions are performed when they are set?
Player commands determines who responds to the player's wingman orders
DetectionMode determines who appears on the NAV map

ForceDetected is like the supply tents in the second (?) OpCobra mission
ForceDetected is the default for friendlies. ForceUndetected is the default for enemies
i swear to god i can never find that pilot

... I actually know what mission you're talking about (A/V-42 campaign) but who are you responding to?
oh i get it now
lost pilot

Is it possible to have an infinitely respawning group in the editor? Looking to make a range map for a couple of friends and would rather not restart the whole lobby every time we deplete the range.
sadly loops can't be used in the editor 😦
but you probably could copy and paste and group in the vts files and set them off using events.

did he set PLAYER spawns or MULTIPLAYER spawns?
they are different, lol
Is there a way to make ships in a sea group snap to their formation positions so they don't move on launch?

Is there a way to make ships in a sea group snap to their formation positions so they don't move on launch?
well you can always use actions to make them move to a path
They do move along a path, but because they don't spawn in perfect formation they have to move around a bit. It's not a functional problem, it just looks goofy

Well this raises the question: How do I exit a mission from the desktop?
you can press either the "del" or "end" key i forgot which one it was.

Why do some missions in the workshop require you to download the map as a separate mod? While others just include the map just fine?
the map is always baked into the mission
i guess its to credit whoever made the map

Am I being dumb or it is what it is?
You *could* have them all spawn and destroy excess units, but that only adds kills and doesn't change the total required amount
Alternatively, you could make the objective conditional and make your own logic

I am unable to test my MP mission that im working on, when I hit launch it says that I need to place a spawn point, but i have multiple MP spawn points placed already. Any one have an idea why it wouldn't be working?
MP missions can only be tested by publishing them to the workshop, subscribing, and then playing them
In other words: "Doing it live"

Is there a way to move the MP spawn during the mission? For example, after capturing an airfield, you can use it as a spawn point.
Nope.
you either need to centrally locate your spawn, or actually do a whole new mission

might be a dumb question but ive spawned in some units and they auto spawn as allies, cant seem to find the option to switch teams?
disregard i'm a dingus
You have to choose enemy units to spawn. it's a different tab

I recently had a hard drive failure. Is there any way I can edit the maps/missions I uploaded to the workshop?
not that i know of, iirc .vts files are encrypted
Drat! thanks

Can spawn points for multiplayer missions be disabled or moved?
What happens to spawn points on a carrier if it is sunk?
you can use alt spawns

hmmm i wonder, if you set the weight for an alt spawn to 0, and the regular spawn on the carrier, then destroy or delete the carrier, does that force all spawns to the alt spawn which is normally weighted 0? interesting.
might be an interesting workaround for the non-movable spawn points
You can't set alt-spawns for carriers apprerntly

Another Q for you guys; I take it there's no way of persisting data from one scenario in a campaign to the next? I'd like to make a campaign where repercussions of failures earlier on in the campaign might not necessarily FAIL the scenario, but will result in differences later on. For example, persistent loss of units - say you lose a support ship early on, that won't be there defending your fleet later on in the campaign. Is there currently any way to do this, or is it on a roadmap? That actually bring me on to another thought - do BD keep a feature/wishlist/roadmap published anywhere so I can not re-raise stuff that's already on their radar 😄 ?
sadly you cant do that but you can use money rewards.
Might see if I can work that into it, maybe so you can't afford certain aircraft. I forgot to mention, I'm thinking Multiplayer here - I've not seen the same campaign options for multiplayer (PvE/co-op). Is there a list of unit/weapon prices anywhere or have I got to go work it out myself 😄 😉

Okay, I think I’m doing this the right way. I want AWACS to take off and follow a path after a certain objective is completed.  I have the path set up and I set up a conditional trigger event that unit group Charlie which is AWACS will take off after the objective is complete.  How do I set it to take off and follow the path.  The trigger will make them take off and I have them all individually set to follow the path. Is that all that needs to be done or am I missing something?
I hope this mission is good 😅 this takes a lot longer than I thought
There is an takeoff order and followpath order

@Strikeeaglechase yo you home yet?
Is there a way to move MP spawns during the course of a mission?
Like, if I have alternate spawns on a carrier and an airbase, will sinking the carrier or changing the airbase faction disable those spawns?

i had a bug after i added alt spawn points... ive tried this: regular spawn cold at hangar, first alt spawn holding short of runway flight ready, and second alt spawn in flight AP... but 2 problems ocurred in my tests.. 1. always spawn at regular spawn. 2. it spawns with gears retracted (cold but like if it was on flight)

How do I make a mission for multiplayer training?  Do I just make a normal mission with multiple player spawns?
Oh I see, it's an option for campaign only
Just make a campaign with 1 mission. :P

and how was that? did he beat it?

if so how, I know i'm telling it to move right, since I do the exact same thing to make the carrier move in stable, but it sits put in public testing
i did same way

Any ideas why it has no effect?
Is the boat spawned at the start of the level?
you might have to call the event sequence via an objective

Is the boat spawned at the start of the level?
you might have to call the event sequence via an objective
Also the "is not" "alive" trigger has always been very fucky for me. I don't use it anymore.  What i do instead is use the NumAlive trigger and set it for "less than" "1". Equals 0 is also sometimes not reliable.  You may have to use UnitList instead of Unit.

Wait what type of event is that?
sequence
says at the top

Do you mean I should set an objective "kill the boat", and it should trigger the SetEngage stat?
No
You should enable trigger on start for the event sequence

Oh fuck, that's what that "start immediately" checkbox does?
It starts it as the mission loads
given you already have a condition on the first box

Alright, thanks! I don't get the checkbox tho - how would the sequence trigger if I don't have the box checked?
You'd have another event that starts this Sequence Event
it never runs anything in it until it receives an external signal to do it (system -> run event)

Have you set it to engage enemies?
Oh I didn't, but now it is - let's try that
Does the MAD4 radar just suck (or have a high min altitude?)  I literally flew over it before it got a lock on me, no terrain in the way

Does the MAD4 radar just suck (or have a high min altitude?)  I literally flew over it before it got a lock on me, no terrain in the way
It got a lock on me and then lost it a few seconds later
it has a minimum range

What is the expected range of the radar itself getting a lock on you?
depends on the aircraft you're in and what's your aspect to it. Your Radar Cross-Section (RCS) determines if the radar will get enough bounce back to detect you
Oh yeah I was flying nose-on in a clean 45

How do I 'join' conditions and logic nodes in the conditional editor? Apologies if I am missing something really obvious but tried every mouse button etc hovering over orange nodes and can't connect them.
like a sequence or like an IF, Else statment?
Sorry just sorted it by clicking on the arrow symbol - I'm trying to work out how to force the mission being failed if the player dies e.g. no respawns allowed. Think I can use conditional objective?

Just set a Failure condition in all of your required objectives

Team A Deaths equals 1

can you just do an event?
Thank you for the screen shot 👍 clicking the arrow seems to be hit and miss for me to join the nodes - no longer working...
You could, but there's already a failure condition option in all the objectives afaik

why make the extra event if you could just do it in the objectives? well I guess if you have a ton of objectives and don't want to set failure for them all
though you'll still have to set the event to fail each objective individually. less work than dealing with the visual scripting
Clicking on the arrow in any condition box in the conditional editor  to get the join line isn't working consistently for me  - is it a known  bug in public branch editor?

Don't think so, I didn't have any problems when I made my stupid AH-94 mission in the public beta
OK thanks - just quitted and restarted and it worked - I'll do that in future as a fix.

As you where speaking about no respawns allowed... How do I do limited respawns.. i didnt figure out how to count deathes.. is it in MP stats node?
I still don't Undestand the usage of sequences.. but probably using this would fix my issues of triggering the wrong events hehe
I haven't specifically looked into it, but the game itself tracks deaths, so you can just fail objectives once Team A has reached 5 deaths for instance. AAS uses a ticket system where you can actually gain more respawn tickets when you capture sectors, so I'm *guessing* that the target number for failure is actually a global variable, and successful sector captures adds 5 to that variable.

U know anything about alt spawns?
Cuz im having some weird stuff happening
I use them sometimes

Set up 3 alt spawn with 100 weight, should be equal chances for all of them right? 1 at ground cold 2 at ground flightready 3 airborne  But it always spawns at 1, cold, but no brakes, no gear, kind if it was in flight.
yeah weight isn't done using 100% the best example i can give is, if you are trying to make a 50/50 chance of spawn you would have to put them both at 100
is this player spawns?

If I put some vehicles into a group they will no longer follow a path and just sit there. Is this supposed to happen?
Are you commanding the individual vehicles to move or the group itself?
I believe if you group them together then you have to command the entire group

Are you commanding the individual vehicles to move or the group itself?

Ok, where do you tell the group to do something? I see the group window and it shows the units in the group

Ok, where do you tell the group to do something? I see the group window and it shows the units in the group
Units in a group will mindlessly do what the group leader does
Who is the group leader?

Who is the group leader?
If the group leader starts moving, they’ll form up on him, then follow in formation
It’s the first unit to be added to the group

what does the "follow" behaviour for units actually do?
Id guess its for making things like wingmen or other planes follow another unit or the player
It would be funny to set a sam to just follow the player all over the map. Just set it as invincible, itd be like the slow unrelenting monster in a horror movie

Limited my spawned f45's in mp to mk83 and guns - set a helipad (vtol start and finish) and attached refuel/rearm unit to each helipad. But it won't allow rearm/refuel - says it is unavailable. Can't you rearm in game once out of briefing room if you limit loadout? Any tips on how to limit loadout but still enable ground refuel of limited weapons appreciated
If you don't allow configuration, then I'm pretty sure rearm isn't allowed
Allow configuration, but each spawn point you can set the allowed weapons in the configuration

Thanks for the response - I'm limiting the loadout per spawn point as you suggest - can't find an option to allow configuration though - all I'm doing is picking mk83 and guns by checking boxes in mp  spawn unit options. Apologies if I am missing an obvious tick box somewhere?
Scenario Info
Edit -> Scenario Info

how can I convert a map to multiplayer? for PvP ?
If its a map then run the public testing version of vtol and start a new campaign - select your map and tick multiplayer option. If its a scenario not a map I think you convert /import but that has not gone well for me. If just your map then set up allies and enemy player mp spawn points using units. I'm still learning the editor so others might have better tips/advice.
OK that might work. I could not place the enemy player in the map editor and I am not finished putting strategic units in place but wanted to test the map with another player to get a feel for the size and scope of the battle field.

How can I create multiplayer missions ?
I found it !
:q_pepedriving:

Any idea in how to implement limited spawns?
ive been thinking for an hour and couldn't figure this
yeh i know, MP Status counts deaths.. but how do i use that..

just a trigger? if mp stats death > X ?
if(teamDeats > x) { fail mission }
why i thought this wouldn't work?  whole mission is base on this logic hahaha, why would it be different? man, i'm so dumb

why i thought this wouldn't work?  whole mission is base on this logic hahaha, why would it be different? man, i'm so dumb
*facepalm*
You were right - started from scratch and the refuel/rearm worked thank you 👍

Can't get infantry - single or group - to follow a path in mp  editor - do I need to in use way points for infantry units?  - just wanted them to patrol around a base in the desert - but setting them to path then selecting a path doesn't work. Clean start with mp mission in public test branch.
send a picture of the setup
Thank you - will do tomorrow just not on my pc now 👍 + how do you attach a picture!

Have two issues if anyone can help please.  1. Found in mp campaign editor  screen that if you just change the campaign description text and nothing else after pressing save and exiting it won't save the description text change. If anyone can check this is the case for them what # do I report it to the dev... Unless it's a known issue in public test branch editor?
2. Edit - Solved. If I use F12 in campaign editor screens I get a pop up bottom  right to say Vtol screen shot saved - but it doesnt appear in the screenshot folder in steam apps / vtol e.t.c.... I am using the desktop 2D version of the editor - is this a known issue or does anyone know how to fix please.
Pressing F12 directs Steam to take a screenshot

how *do* you make MP missions? Do you have to do it via the MP mod or is there something in the base game?
Be on the public test beta branch, create a multiplayer campaign. Create missions in that multiplayer campaign
I can't find a way to get the editor to save changes to the main campaign description and name - it will upload changes to steam workshop but then in the editor when I go back in its reverted to the original desc and name I put in when I first created the campaign - anyone else have that issue / know if it's a known bug?

Try making a timed event that starts 1 second late and assings the units to move along the path
I cant see anything wrong from here

Have you ever had any issues with saving changes to mp campaign description / and or name. Save goes green then greyed when clicked on and changes upload to steam wkshop but when I reload campaign the desc and title have reverted to the very first text I put in when setting up the campaign originally..... is this a known issue?
No
OK thank you - I'll try a new test  campaign and see if I get the same thing.

thank you! will my friends have to opt in to the public beta to be able to play the mission?
yup
dunno if im being mega dense here, do you opt into the public beta on steam? i've done that but it doesnt seem to have changed anything in the editor, i dont see any MP options

You right click on the vtol logo click on properties and go into betas and you should find a selection menu for all the different versions.

public unstable build testing? is that the one?
Yes
It should be the top one.

you cant just do scenarios then? has to be via the campaign menu?
It has to be in a campaign
The campaign can have just one mission, and the missions it contains don't have to be related at all

and im getting from some of the previous posts in here if you've started making a mission in SP it doesnt convert over very well to MP?
I'm not even sure if there's an in-game way to do it tbh. Hand editing the files is inherently sketchy
Also save your description somewhere and be prepared to change it every time you update the mission/campaign

Since loops aren't available yet, has anyone created a tool to automate cloning triggers?
uhh no but you could do it yourself
not directly, but you can edit the VTS file or convert it to JSON then edit it there

Has Baha confirmed if looping triggers will ever be added?
He hasn't said its planned
but also hasn't said itll never come so we cna have hope

See if what's possible? Looping? As far as I can tell a trigger will only ever resolve once.

Gah you've already done so much here. I've been putting off learning JS/TS and writing webapps for way too long. Might as well throw myself into it. You know of any good tutorials for an otherwise experienced programmer?
Uhhh not sure to be honest, I picked up JS as my first language so I don't know a lot about how to jump into it from an already experienced perspective
I could probably write a python version in a little bit

what are you trying to do?
chase jumping from the high language to the even higher language
Currently, custom missions do not support looping/repeatable triggers. Once a trigger fires once, it will never ever fire again. The workaround is to clone the trigger, making as many copies of it as could be reasonably fired during a single playthrough. I want to make a mod that adds a "Copies" counter to the conditional trigger UI so it saves that many copies of the trigger in the VTS file instead of just one.

what kind of trigger actions are you trying to loop?
The first one off the top of my head is to spawn hostile craft every time a player spawns.
units can only be spawned once though

I don't play with the mission editor a lot but maybe you could add an event to revive/repair a unit? That way you can reuse it without needing to mess with spawning more ones each time
Shoot down some targets, then hide them, repair them, and teleport them back to their starting location in a loop
No way to resurrect or repair destroyed units that I know

i'm pretty sure it's already been askep a lot but what the hell 🙂 : Do we have any insight on when it will be possible to implement comuniy missions/maps/campaings in multiplayer?
It already is on the public testing branch. It'll be pushed to the main branch when it's working well
oh cool so i just have to switch to public test on steam to have a look right?

I'm trying to create a multiplayer campaign. I changed to the Public Test branch, I verified the game files. I'm not seeing the Multiplayer checkbox you were talking about. Am I looking in the wrong place?
You're not on the public test branch
this one, right?

will "force undetected" work against AI?
i.e. if i set a friendly unit to "force undetected" enemies wont detect/engage
or do i need to add non-targets for the enemies

Is there a way to play an audio file specifically to one or more players in mp - eg two planes from a 6 plane flight wander into a proximity area and only they hear the audio track? Just thinking about mp user specific messages - so alpha 1-2 for instance flys into a proximity area on their own and rather than triggering a generic msg everyone hears only they hear 'you are in the vicinity of the enemy base e.t.c.' as that message would be confusing to the rest of the mp flight.
@besp09 I don't think there's one for a certain player for the jets but there is one for a specific team and if the player is in the helo.  I checked for the same thing awhile ago.
@besp09 Should be "Radio Message Team" and "Copilot Radio Message" in the Event Action Browser.

Is there a max amount of missions you can add to a campaign?
i don't think so but the max would probably be the amount of storage it takes up.
Ah okey! And what about max amount of objectives in a single mission? If there is one?

Ah okey! And what about max amount of objectives in a single mission? If there is one?
well i would doubt that as well
i find briefing images take up the most storage.

Also does baha blast make all the missions in the multiplayer?
like on the workshop?
No for the like pre made missions for the not public testing missions

Also has there been any chances for missions that a person has made to be added to the game? Like a competition or something?
That sounds fun tbh
Likie best overall missions might get added

Does Force Undetected mean that a unit can't be detected?
no, it just means it s not showing on navmap at the beginning , useful to hide ally on start, like missing para
Is there a way to swap units teams mid game I think it would be cool for AV's to drop troops to "capture an airfield" and then 1 team could land and resupply

Does anyone know if there is a unit cap or not?
Well you could test
I dont think there is a limit per se but your framerate will begin to suffer at some point. Where that point is is depends on your PC.

Hmm... I set an objective checked as start immediatly and use the 'start event' to send wpt to gps.. but gps shows nothing when in game... Was this supposed to happen?
Another question as you were talking about unit cap... not spawned units will affect fps?
not really

Another question as you were talking about unit cap... not spawned units will affect fps?
not really
there's like 3 servers

Did you set the waypoint in the event? I don't think it will send the objective's waypoint, you have to tell the event what waypoint you want (which can be the objective's, but you need to set it manually)
There's like 10 at peak times
Plus you could like get friends

Has this ever been answered? I also would like to know if you can reorder the events by dragging them around or something other than going into text file.
I suspect the answer is "no"
Props for using the search functionality, though

Is this a multiplayer mission or something?
Yes editor event > send to GPS doesnt work in mp AFAIK
can confirm did not work in mp

Even if you’re spawned and flying around?
yeah, but that was before the last update
What's the easiest way to make tanks patrol a city?

What's the easiest way to make tanks patrol a city?
Make a path through the city, tell the tanks to follow the path
Make sure to shove them all in the same group

The path has to follow the roads, right? Should I put the nodes in intersections?
it does not
The tanks can go up 90 degree slopes

Mod please pin this? @Shadowtail?
Turn off the equipment selection through the mission info and open insert cam.
this is already pinned somewhere

Also, is there a trick to spawn a group of units with alt-spawns together?
Like, if I want a full squad of tanks to spawn in 1 of 4 possible locations
If I just give them all alt spawns I assume they will be separated

I don't quite understand the reason for Entry *and* Exit conditions in Event Sequences. Shouldn't it just be a single "Continue" condition to advance to the next sequence node?
you have a delay at the begining of each node
after the delay the condition is check. So you for example exit condition, unit is dead, then wait 20 sec before going to next node.

What's the difference between adding an exit condition to Node 1, vs adding it as an entry condition to Node 2?
realization
Let say, you want to play a radio after the last tank is dead, then complete the objective once the radio is completed.

Maybe it's just because I'm looking at this from a programmer perspective? I already understand how to use a state machine intuitively.
Again, every entry condition can be substituted by adding empty node above with an exit condition
but its more click doing so :p

Hey this has probably already been asked but why are my bases are roads being erased when I load the map in missions editor?
Did you manually copy the map and rename the folder without renaming the .vtm file inside?
No I just saved it in game

Did you manually copy the map and rename the folder without renaming the .vtm file inside?
No I just saved it in game
I’ve tried twice and the bases keep getting deleted

Did you change the map after you originally created the mission?
No I’ve made new missions each time
odd

Specifically on one map or did you try more?
I’ll try another
Height and city changes are saved to the .png files, which have static names. Bases and roads are saved to the .vtm file, which has a dynamic name. This is why I think it's a problem with the .vtm file.

Do you have any antivirus software running?
No
This is a bit out of scope

I think I know how to make a specific tank or group of tanks patrol a city following a path, but what's the best way to have many units patrol separately? Can I have units start at different points within the path? Do I have to create a separate path for each separate patrol?
Units will start following a path at the point closest to them
Oh, that's perfect

just to make sure, not spawned units are accounted as 'not alive' in conditionals right?
Units are alive until they're killed
Unspawned units are thus alive

if more than 3 players AND those units destroyed? 😛
why i can't think without writing it here. i feel so dumb every time haha
talking out problems is the greatest way to solve them sometimes

omg youre about to show me something that will change my life?
WOW
it's a bit of a joke/meme, but at the same time there's a truth to it

that should cover both cases.. right?
oh, last node is wrong
imagine as num alive equal 0

Do I need to speak or read portuguese? XP
otherwise yeah I'm happy to help test
well.. mission briefing and objectives are in portuguese, as well as some audio hehe.. but u could just take down every enemies.. thats what is meant to be done in the missions haha

How do you change the missile type on the launcher?
When looking in the launcher's settings there is a tab for equips just like air units
It was hiding from me for the longest time

What's the maximum reasonable altitude to have an enemy AEW-50 AWACS orbit at?
> BSM-66 - "Standard radar-guided missile." The standard Surface-to-Air Missile. Attempts to intercept the target, dealing major damage on impact. >  > BSM-66LR - "Standard radar-guided missile. Equipped with [a] first-stage booster for extended range." A regular SAM missile with an extra booster stage, giving it much longer range and making it harder to outrun or outmaneuver. >  > FLKM-100 - "Dual stage long range radar-guided missile that deploys a field of explosive munitions." Essentially a BSM-66LR that functions as an aerial cluster bomb. Intercepts the target and deploys a small field of cluster bomblets in front of them. The spread-out damage makes it excellent for dealing with bandits in close formation. from the wiki
30k, 40 at the very most

I think you're off by exactly one order of magnitude there. I assume the original poster meant 32,800 ft?
meters are bigger than feet, so the number for meters should never be bigger than the number for feet
Ahh, the power of editing. Sneeky breeky

All the fixed wings are 40k right?
Heli is like 12 somthin
I think the 42 default is 30-35

What's to prevent the AH-94s from just lobbing AGM-145s over the mountain to LOAL? Or are you just restricting their weapons to prevent that?
I remember for a time there was a hard limit to the game at 40k ft
Was it not 10000m?

yeah, you could just ban them. feels like a cop-out though, y'know? A heavy-handed way of escaping poor mission design
Ehh, at least for the AH94 banning 145s is a great way to add a bit more challenge
True. 145s OP

Speaking of, anyone have a writeup of good mission design? (Or bad things to avoid?)
Most effective Sam on my first mission was a launcher tucked deep as you say with 3 radar on the crest... Great idea about triggering support radars
RWR just *lights up.* "Oh.... fuck."

....why couldn't I just spawn 30nm closer if literally nothing happens and there's no threat in the first 30nm?
same with making objectives really far apart, with nothing interesting or challenging in between for huge stretches
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2569449610

also, you can make checkpoints make quicksaves in missions right?
why does noone do that
you can also limit the number of quicksaves in a mission. I found that out the hard way

to prevent quicksave spamming? The RPG player trope of quicksave after every 10 steps, every item picked up, every enemy killed
tho quicksaves sorta buggy now anyways, so..... probably better to not rely on them
Maintain your weapons and they will rarely, if ever, jam.

so I can go past 196km?
Yes
O-O

is it a things where you just have to edit the file?
Yes
ah

do you happen to know how that effects performance?
It's bad if you add a lot of things to it, same as normal missions
the terrain itself doens't seem to lag the game the bigger it is, but he didn't go *too* big

To play devil's advocate, what would you think of a game like Euro Truck Simulator where the majority of the gameplay *is* realistically driving a truck across Europe for hours at a time?
also DCS: Exists
to add on, spawning in 10-20 miles away puts you directly into sam range when you take off

I am, yes, what about you?
don't push your luck

i thought stupidMap was ketkev?
no no that was ketkev
That's relatively niche gaming though. While some people find it fun, most don't. We're talking about general principles here. Like ArmA is generally pretty realistic, but it's too much so for most people. Designing for simmers is different from designing for the general gaming population.

Like, a realistic mission would be jet transfer. Make a huge map. Take off from one corner. Fly straight line to the other corner. Land. Mission complete. Would some people find that fun? There's probably a few. The vast majority wouldn't.
Unless you are catering to a specific crowd, a lot of "realistic" bits can be trimmed off to make a mission more enjoyable for a greater number of people
Well you've kind of answered your own dilemma; the people who like that kind of mission will play that mission, and the ones who don't won't

Oh dang, this goes all the way back to that?
Yep.
Ahh, but what I was talking about was the inclusion of a 40nm flight to an objective for no reason. What would otherwise be, say, a straightforward strike mission that includes a massive long flight for no reason other than... "realism." Trim that flight out, it's unnecessary and makes the mission more tedious for most people

would it really be a mission then if the objectives are right outside of spawn?
sounds more like target practice idk
lol

And a lengthy flight could also be fine *if it has a purpose* like evading heavy air defense by requiring low terrain flying. Then the pilot is doing *something* right?
but there's also long missions like killbox or falklands where it takes a bit to get to objectives
both are really fun

Is there a way to view global values in mission?

otherwise, no

Im looking for player controllable chopper... can I not have mixed playable vehicles in amission ?
Is it a singleplayer or multiplayer mission?
multi

Is it a singleplayer or multiplayer mission?
multi
well im makinag it for multi, i just literally opened mission editor and added a carrier and fa-26b's to it.. and wanting to add the attack chopper also

ok i think i may have figured it, do i need to put player spawn poinst down instead of the actual aircraft? and by that means, will the mission only have 1 playable type of aircraft?
ok i really dont understand how this thing works
depends on objectives and enemy types, whether you want to start detected etc.  if you're bombing a location and the only threat is a short range/IR sams then a bit of a  waste of time  jets get away with it a bit, once you're up you travel a lot of distance quite fast, helo not so much  also annoying when a ah94 workshop mission insists on you climbing a 15000ft mountain

Can a unit be destroyed before being spawned?
good question
yes

Hey, is the multiplayer editor in the public testing build of the game? Trying to figure out how you'd add multiple player slots.
Oh I see
I have to start a campaign, it can't be a standalone mission.

Oh hey, it's Rimmy, lol. So you did read my youtube comment (maybe?). XD Looking forward to seeing what craziness y'all get up to
No longer true! You can launch a test from the editor now, but it will be a private game that no one can join (since it's not on the workshop yet)
OMG this is awesome

SAM Launcher doesn't need *any* line of sight on the target, right? Only the radar it's linked to.
correct
Would be cool to have transport vehicles like an LMTV in addition to all the other ground vehicles to be able to create  convoys or pose as support vehicles should there be a need for them in creating a mission.

This Russian convoy satellite images making you hungry?
Very much so lol
Hey guys, how do i convert a singleplayer campaign to MP?

Hey guys, how do i convert a singleplayer campaign to MP?
I think all you have to do is switch to the public testing branch, click edit your campaign then you should see a box to click that says 'MP Campaign' before you select a mission to edit. That will make it a multiplayer campaign, and then you just drop in 'MP spawn units'  in to your missions in that campaign.   From what i understand you cannot make multiplayer one off missions yet. They have to be housed in a multiplayer enabled campaign.
Cool, thanks! I'll try to do that.

With the developer camera up, pressing Tab allows me to shoot a machine gun with left click. Don't suppose anyone knows of a way to drop bombs from the developer camera?
no you cant
I havent even attempted to check this my self, but do AI wingmen work in MP?

I havent even attempted to check this my self, but do AI wingmen work in MP?
They can certainly exist and follow scripting, but I don't think they can be given orders.
And they can't be grouped with the players afaik because players can't be assigned to a flight group

@L etranger or anyone else, I'm preparing to release my first custom mission. It has many triggers and complicated mechanics. I've thoroughly tested it in SP to ensure it's stable, and I'm about to covert it to MP. Anything specific you recommend testing after converting a mission to MP?
make sure the players have enough time to fuck around before the missions starts, so everyone joins and takes-off, regroups and whatnot
So like, don't start triggering time based stuff too quick into the mission?

So like, don't start triggering time based stuff too quick into the mission?
Basically, yes
And time-based events in general, try to let the players go at their own pace, MP might take longer than normal missions because people are like that

What's the best way to delay a "mission start" radio message until everyone has spawned in?
I tried making it on a 5sec delay but by the time I spawn in it's already done
I usually use a 7sec delay rules

*unrelated question: do you work in the communications industry?*
Unrelated question, if the mission fails do all triggers just stop working?
Or events in general

Unrelated question, if the mission fails do all triggers just stop working?
Or events in general
You mean objectives?

no.. strange question, why ? 😄
7 seconds is usually the delay between a live broadcast and what the client receives
This is probably my fault because I don't really make missions but I accidentally made the mission fail and almost immediately all of my hidden groups spawned in

Possibly related to the potential race condition I've noticed? https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/957356092000722964
Put a 1sec delay between the spawn action the "go here" actions
@Sypwn  there isn't much you can do. MP should work out of the boxes. If you tested properly all condition in SP it should be good. Make sure tho if you reference player in condition to change the ref to mp_spawn_1 or mp_spawn_2 etc

Also unrelated question, what is a good way to tell if storage tents have been blown up? I went with a really wonky: ``` if(storagetent1.isNotAlive)                                 AND if(storagetent2.isNotAlive)          AND if(storagetent3.isNotAlive)                                AND if(storagetent4.isNotAlive)                 OR    failthemission          if(storagetent5.isNotAlive)                                 AND if(storagetent6.isNotAlive)          AND if(storagetent7.isNotAlive)                                AND if(storagetent8.isNotAlive) ```
Thanks. I kept the MP spawns in the entire time as AI units, and I'm swapping them back to MultiplayerSpawn in the vts
and I don't think it worked well

There's an option to just read from the list of storage tents?
:waa:
same to easily have a no enemy near a waypoint  (Secure area) unit list > not any near waypoint. for AAS, I just use a 15Km radius waypoint, select all units, unselect players, and just wait for not any near waypoint to valid the obj.

can I shadow moment you?
I found a junky solution to make a 1 life per slot dynamic mission.
I thought about it deeply one day and keep wondering, how would a script work in this case?  Let's say JSON to assign properties, or whatever, the current property menu is fine.  For triggers though?

more like an interface to use code action.

Any simple way to get a higher resolution picture of a map than the 512x512 preview image? The loading screen has the "VTeditor" in the middle and the minimap has gridlines.

Regarding multiplayer campaign editor. Is it a known issue that you can only spawn in the av-42c when attempting to launch the scenario from the editor or something?
How do you add multiple players to a mission in the mission editor?
Selected player aircraft as ah-94 for both player mp spawns launched scenario from mission editor In the slot and equipment selection scene I still showed ah-94 options, and even could select equipment for them there (though I just left the equipment what is had by default for me) spawned in in with a av-42c with no equipment ejected a couple times and still only got the av-42c went back to mission editor, and my MP spawn points had reverted to av-42c (maybe I forgot to save) after setting them to ah-94 again and saving everything worked as normal  Still odd that the slot selector showed ah-94 and it's equips the first time, despite spawning me in the av-42c

Does anyone know if there is a way for an AI AV - 42c to drop off troops? And if so how?

Does anyone know if there is a way for an AI AV - 42c to drop off troops? And if so how?
There is, yes. I've definitely done it in a mission, had an AV-42 that spawned with troops drop them off, and that completed an objective. It's one of the action events available
Thank you so much

Anyone got the list of dev controls for mission testing?
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor
Wait it has been deleted.

Hi , after creating a map and a mission that is not a training one  when i choose the aircraft i don't have any missiles to attach ; anyone knows why ?
You need to permit equips. If it's a singleplayer mission, that's done in the scenario options. If it's a multiplayer mission, it's done on the player spawner entity
how do i spawn players for coop scenario

is there a shortcut to make the hud invisible so i can take a screenshot?
btw, can ai fighter jets form up on the attack helicopter?
I couldn't find one so I just ended up using Windows Snipping Tool to get images from the editor.

Is there a way to duplicate missions in a campaign so I don't have to remake the entire mission for a pt2?
the is a "save as" option.
Ah ok

did you try and save and then it froze?
it has not froze
seems like a ui bug

wait has the file been corrupted?
no
okay good

is there a way to add subtitles in the mission editor yet?
You can sorta do it by using the tutorial message function
that will display text over the pilot's view

Any way to track how many saves a player makes within a mission? I know how to limit or turn off, just want to update a global value on save amounts for a sort of scoring system
hey, im pretty new to the editor and was wondering if there is a way to select multiple units at once? thanks!
Sadly. No.

ooof

Whats the bullseye in the scenario info?
its a reference point on the map people can make callouts in reference to
Okey thx

Is there a way to create a custom mission with the editor that is using the quickstart map? Can't seems to find it in the available maps ...
What's the quickstart map?
if you mean the freeflight 2 map, or the f45 freeflight maps, i dont think those are included with the game

hey guys, is there a way to respawn killed Units with a trigger?
a new trigger with a spawn action dosent semm to do the trick
Nope, gotta spawn whole different set of units, sadly.

Dosent that slow down the mission though?
might be easier to copy 'em by opening the .vts in notepad and just doing a copy-paste and then edit some names
I dunno why it's that way, it just is that way, lol

does it work with mp though?
Yup
oof

Has anyone been able to figure out how to get the ground units to spawn? I made the waypoints like the guide says and none of them spawn. Also enemy air planes just spawn immediately right on front of me and serve me like a Chick-fil-A drive thru
quick question
is this meters, kilometers or nautical miles?

is this meters, kilometers or nautical miles?
its fine, I'll wait until you maybe update it ^^. Its just such a nice addition to have endless waves, its as close to arma/dcs liberation as we can get so far so im excited to see your mod updated 🙂
Afaik meters

Am I right in thinking there is no way to revive destroyed units?
There is not.
Thanks

I can get an npc to taxi out to the runway with a path and then give him the takeoff command. But later, I can't get him to follow a taxi path after giving him the land command. He always follows his own route to the same hanger. Is it not possible after land command to prevent him from continuing his predefined taxi route?
Plane on ground can be finicky, I personnaly avoid any micro management at all. Execpt Take Off/Land, follow path in air.
Hello, I am trying to make a mission now that workshop multiplayer is public, but it is only letting me create one player spawnpoint

Also, what happens if I have more MP spawn points than seats in the briefing room?
bc of the new update, could anybody make like a multiplayer target practice map?
cause might be fun to do with my friend

Timed events. I've set a timed event not to start immediatly. then i have a triger event to 'begin' the timed event. Timed event never initiate. Why? haha
Have to see how you set it up to be able to tell you
No way we can know without seeing it

can you open the mission editor/vtol without opening/plugging in your vr headset?
yes
how would you go about it? I know you can launch your game but dont you get stuck waiting to press ready while in the carrier atc?

how would you go about it? I know you can launch your game but dont you get stuck waiting to press ready while in the carrier atc?
Try it and see?
no there's "mission editor" and "map editor" buttons in the bottom right once you get to that scene

is it possible to play radio messages for only one team to hear in multiplayer missions?
nop
phooey

can someone send me good missions with the ah 94 heli?
like send files
of the missions

Does anyone know where VTOL VR stores workshop scenarios? It's not under customscenarios, nor does it seem to be in %appdata%
As in ones that you've downloaded from the workshop, or ones you've created?
Ones that have been downloaded.

There's a whole bunch of stuff in Steam/SteamApps/Workshop

So, when placing a drone carrier, is there any way to edit the on-board manta's weapon loadout?
Nope
They just spawn with the double machineguns

Did the debug camera change to remove the gun option or am I just not finding the right guide?
ok i see
I hear a rumour it's not available when doing multiplayer testing

how do you add spawnpoints to carriers?
click on the carrier, and click the button label "edit spawns" or something
i dont remember the exact name

hey i'm struggling to get the helicopter to work, it always only has a pilot slot. Anyone know how to fix this?
what should I press here to enable the second seat to work?
"allowed slots" to 2

what should I press here to enable the second seat to work?
"allowed slots" to 2
oh wow

can you place infantry on enemy carriers?
They won’t move with it
So it’ll just sail off, leaving them floating

Even if the carrier is parked?
if the carrier is parked
and nothing moves

how good is the manta ucav in combat?
i have a drone carrier and i don't want to overwhelm the players
They are not that great

what is a reasonable amount of aircraft to throw at the players?
6 per player running a2a would be reasonable/easy
Naval strike has something akin to 30

what dose reload time mean on sam launchers?
like after it fires one missile or all 4
all 4

do ships attack each other at close ranges?
if they have an antiship VLS
carriers dont

Can you disable the orange team if you just want PVE?
Rocket boats will *crush* ships lol
Yup, just don't put any spawns in.

how do I fail a mission if a unit is destroyed or players go to a certain area?
is the win decided if a team completes all its objectives?
😭

is the win decided if a team completes all its objectives?
😭
If you set an objective as required and that objective is failed, the mission will fail

can someone send me good missions with the ah 94 heli?
files of the mission
You can't get them off the workshop?

You can't get them off the workshop?
I think they want the unencrypted mission editor files
yea do you have any?

yea do you have any?
or do you know where i can get some
Now I'm kinda curious why you want them

how do you make a naval fleet move to a waypoint in formation?
if someone can send me some i would be grateful
so please

so no one has any missions?
Just download them from the steam workshop it's really easy
Will that work also if you give a path to the first unit in a group?

putting an enemy aircraft on "force detected" means the allied radar will be forced to detect the aircraft no matter any stealth implementations correct?
Nope
then what does it do

so if i put force undetected it will never ever show up on the navigation but it will on the radar?
Again, no 😛
.O.

Have you played the built-in campaigns?
bearly
There’s a mission in the AV-42 one where you have to find a lost allied pilot

did you make that mission?
yes
fuck you

did you do it alone?
no there was other people
i made it to be up for hours

to refuel off the apache?
to refuel the ah-94
oh

what, the rotor disk tilt?
so you fly up
also, that 105 PIO

do *"Team A"* and *"Team B"* refer to the Allied and Enemy teams respectively?
Yes
If you put a helicopter MPspawn point down in a multiplayer campaign mission, does that prevent players who don't have the DLC from playing in that mission? Even if you have other non dlc aircraft MPspawns available to fly in that mission?

People without the heli DLC can fly the non-heli slots
nice!

Quick question. Apologies if this has been covered although I couldn't see it? I have created an AH-94 Multiplayer campaign by converting an existing single player campaign. Is there anything I need to do in relation to settings within the editor to accommodate other players aircraft being able to spawn in or for two people to occupy one aircraft? I am quite experienced with the single player version of the mission editor but have not used the multiplayer functionality at all so i'm looking for some advice?
I have no idea for the Helo. The player spawn aircraft are just in the units for mp campaign editors
Probably adds two seats in the menu if you select an AH-94

how do you add players to team b?
unrelated, capture the AWACS
you get like, 3 awacs's's's's's's per team

Can anyone advise the most effective way to set up no respawns in a mp game please for x1 helo set to 2 seats. @Thenlar i think you must have done this for your island AH94 mission? Thanks.
The Enemy Team gets so many cool sea troops while team A gets an assault carrier Aircraft Carrier and Cruiser i wonder why
I set a failure condition on every single objective. "If Team A Deaths = 1"

Can someone explain to me how to convert a single player mission into a multiplayer one? I think I did it, but I dont know
It has it listed as a separate mission in the workshop
need to be a campaign first

like, edit in the mission editor or in notepad?
in mission editor for the spawn
I do all my mission in SP coz I can skip the helmet, disable configuration screen; play in accelerated and kill any unit (without using my headset). When the flow is good I convet and add the mp spawn

Would it still show up separately on the workshop from the SP version?
Yes it will be a campaign
Got it

Which flavour of Sam site?
How do I command the enemy artillery to shoot a specific target such as an allied tank or a refueling base?
nvm i figured it out

You in the f45 or something?
ah
that may be it

I'm needing some help with a scenario I made, in the mission editor I have about 7 enemies that are coming towards our air base but when I try to host the scenario all the enemies are gone and the mission says complete, what's going on?
do you have any logic errors like events.
also what are your objectives

is there any way we could jump into a call and you could help explain this to me?
Are the enemies spawning and pathing in a sensible way? Are they spawning underground, or at Mach 1 at ground level?
they are in the air about 5000 feet going around 350kts and speed up and travel to about 30k feet

Are the enemies spawning and pathing in a sensible way? Are they spawning underground, or at Mach 1 at ground level?
they are in the air about 5000 feet going around 350kts and speed up and travel to about 30k feet
are they set to spawn instantly?

are they set to spawn instantly?
they spawn when I do a trial run in the mission editor but when I host the scenario they don't spawn
You’re absolutely 100% sure they don’t exist when you start the scenario?

You’re absolutely 100% sure they don’t exist when you start the scenario?
yeah
I'm new to the editor so I'm gonna say most likely

If I want a trigger from a vehicle control would being switched on be a value of 1 and off a value of 0?
Post mortem: Confusion about what the events meant caused all the enemy units to be murdered as soon as the mission started
@Throttle just had a little think, and I believe your second objective is still wrong, but not in a way that’ll stop you killing the enemy

Is there any way to get C-RAMS to engage rockets? I find them just sitting around and not doing the thing they were literally designed to do pretty goofy
They should do that automatically. They're just not very good at it
Not doing the C-RAM justice

But they can kinda hit bombs? Eh
Honestly the player would be pressed even make it over to where the c-rams are in operation without failing the mission (if the rocket trucks are allowed to fire for more than 60 seconds it's basically too much civilian infrastructure destroyed)
I've had it shoot down 3 mavericks and myself

So you're saying the literally won't even try to shoot at rocket artillery? No funny tracers?
no, they can only shoot at aircraft or missile actors
its not possible to shoot an artillery shell, im not sure if rockets have hitboxes

You can manually keep the radar on those off right?
Yeah could work
On the plus side this would leave some burning wreckage sitting around like something got hit and damaged by rockets

unless you want the ciws to be the burning wreckage?
No, I was thinking the manta
I thought they were only fully destroyed if they took enough damage or crashed from a sufficient altitude

Is there a way to turn a friendly into an enemy - change teams? Using trigger to engage enemies currently but wanted them to be 'blue' until a proximity breach (eg helo flys too close) then they turn into enemy... Didn't think killing the blue then spawning the same in red on top would work - fire/bodies left on map e.t.c.
No
Thanks

Is there any documentation or tutorial on using the mission editor? I’d like to learn more about it, but don’t have time to go in and fiddle around with it. Reading or watching something while on break at work would be better for me
There's the wiki
Ok I’ll check it out

Yo, how to add multiple players?
Create a multiplayer campaign, create a scenario in that multiplayer campaign. Create MP Spawn entities in that scenario
Ah, ok, thanks man.

For refueling. Is it necessary to set a KC-49 (for instance) with a relatively straight path, or having it orbit a way-point enough? I don't know if the refueling plane will be flying straight when/if it detect a plane is coming in for refueling ...
It can refuel in a turn, so making it orbit is fine
it's just *slightly* more difficult to refuel on a constantly turning tanker.

but you can understand how to modify the game files themselves?
:squint:
"the mission" there are a lot of missions

Why do you need/want those files?
i said that i dont know how to explain in english
Could always try google translate, but the files are just binary data im not sure how that would help you

just do you have any?
Yeah here one second
lol tried google translate its jsut giving bullshit

*what if it was hexadecimal data?*
:Think:
Nah it’s octal data

would you have the logs?
I don’t do any more
Perhaps they did respawn

Can someone explain the situation with force detected /undetected and red enemy marker display distance please. Got a mp mission in Ah94's I am working on  - proximity event  triggers x2 manpads spawning on separate roof tops - close to where a helo needs to land on a roof top in a city - the helos are limited to fcr and cannon of choice. Is the red unit marker appearance distance related e.g. If you are within x metres it dissapeard? - would force detected effect distance it shows. Helos will be within 200 metres of these sniper manpads when they spawn - is there a way to bracket them in red that close to help helo location (I know i could move them/turn them into infantry to make it easier...) just wanted to know how the red marker brackets actually work. Also I have tried to set a bunker before now to force undetected to stop it being found easily but the Ah94 still pings it with the enemy orange brackets from 100's of metres away. Is there a way to stop this?
Force detecte doesn't affect the < > around units
Force Undetected doesn't affect the ability to detect units on radar

Thank you for that explanation 👍 do you know if there are distance rules on the red brackets appearing/dissapearing in view? And if so how far away would I have to place an enemy so when it spawns it will get bracketed? - and Im assuming the visor in thd Ah94 (or Jets) doesn't effect red brackets showing or not? I'm assuming their visibility is just a distance thing.
There surely are, but I've no idea what they are
It's not pure distance

A few questions:   1. Can you develop a single mission then import it later into a campaign or do you have to develop the mission as a campaign set from the beginning?  2. Can a unit/units have a randomized spawn point (possible locations picked in the editor) and can units have a percent chance of spawning?  3. Can you have randomized secondary objectives and what may be some logic things to consider to prevent bugs?
1) Single player, yes. Multiplayer, no.
2) Yes, yes.

Is there a way to limit the starting fuel level for the player? I manually added "fuel = 50" to the player section (in its "UnitFields") like I saw it done for other units, but in the 'equip' screen in game it was still set to full. I'd like to enforce the player starting with less fuel, as to inforce the need to hit a tanker first.
Internally fuel is typically a percentage, not sure if it’s the same in the mission editor but I’m guessing you want .5 fuel
I assumed it was percent, since for example that field was set to 100 for a E-4.

i really need an AI respawner tool. Is there not a single way to respawn units after they died?
nah
the best you can do is copy the unit and spawn it again

When you're calling for a unit to trigger a waypoint in a multiplayer campaign mission, is 'Player' and 'MP_Spawn' the same in this instance?
yes
turns out this needs 3 conditions to be met for each alternate spawn :pain:

how do i add wingmen?
Set your player to alpha squad and place a wingman of your choice and set their squad to alpha
when i say form up on me they say they are busy

Hey, in the mission editor is the 'Move Spawn' trigger action bugged? Each time I trigger it in a mission I end up really bugged out with graphic glitches and I just see a blue sky as far as I can see.
help! Everytime my missions says mission completed at 0:00:00
but it only shows after i kill 1 enemy unit

Hello, I am launching VTOL VR withotu my headset plugged in, and want to jump into the Mission Editor, I am right now in the main menu, but can't click on any of the buttons (QUIT, MAP EDITOR, MISSION EDITOR) Is there something I am missing?

Go to "previous version"

Is that a Battlefield 4 thing as the thumbnail? I love it
Would anyone be interested in trying a different style of mission? I call it project unlimited. Enemys are scattered all over the map and enemy aircraft spawn every 20 minutes to intercept. It'd be a good air and ground mix
For the fa26

random encounters moment

Do the targets get marked? Or do you expect people to search for them? Note that currently it is impossible to respawn units. You are limited by the number of times you are willing to copy those units and triggers.
There's alot of enemies on the map so I didn't add any waypoints. If you can't find something to shoot there's something wrong
No real objective just fly and blow shit up as you get intercepted every 20 min. Some planes are fighters some are bombers and some are uavs

What's the objective? Kill everything, or just a certain number?
Oh
Personally I wouldn't be as interested in a mission with no final objective, but others might like it.

Does a mission end when all objectives that exist have been completed(either as a success or a failure)? Or do i need to set some sort of mission ending logic?
Once the last active objective is ended, the mission ends
Thanks!

Hi, I have a few questions i couldnt find here after searching:   1: I created a simple scenario in the current release build as a sort of firing range for me and a friend to practice AH ATG combat, I‘ve read to play it in MP you have to edit it in the test build to set up spawns etc.  How do I get there and can i „port“ my scenario to the testing version (and back if it can be played on in the release branch) and how do i set up different spawns for other vehicles? (Right now i have parked AI as placeholders)  2: As a fitting end to destroying all the practice Targets i set up a RTB objective that triggers if either the vehicle is damaged, low on fuel (is the entered number a percentage e.g 20.00 or do i have to enter 00.20 for 20%?) or all targets are destroyed, and to counter the RTB disappearing if there a mid mission refuel i set up a RTB2 that only triggers if all enemies are destroyed, would that work or will the game be confused if i were to complete both RTBs at once?  3: For AI ground units theres an option for something called move in radius. What is that Radius and can it be changed?  Thanks you all ^^
1) You can now create and play custom scenarios in multiplayer in the regular build, so no more need for public testing
It's possible to convert a single player scenario to a multiplayer one, but I'm not sure of the exact steps

Ok thanks a lot, so just start the current build and instead of mission editor go to campaign editor and then theres an option to go for mp ones?
Where you'd normally pick the aircraft, there's a tick box for multiplayer
(When creating a campaign)

does cancel objective not work when the objective is started then?
Interesting. Didn't know that was there
No idea what it does

how to make artillery/rocket artillery fire at target?
There's an event action for that
oh ok ty

is it possible to get player count the easy way?
I use cancel objective on non required objective for AAS
nvm, I half answered my own question for getting player count on a single team:

I would like to make a mission, but i dont have many good ideas, does anyone have some ideas for missions?
you don't need a good mission idea just a good way to execute it.
but its impossible to make a (good) mission without an idea

if you want to do a multiplayer operation, here's the brief for one i did with my server https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EgLHsw29X7MUXfX_X_vP6OPMqDk689Ms-vOW6FzuE0Y/edit?usp=sharing
its milsim so if thats not what you want it might not be super helpful
for me i just envision shit that may happen in like 15 years

Anyone know if there's a way to compare 2 global values?
I can think of a really horribly way
oh god

Have most of the recent bugs been ironed out? Sounds like it. I may jump back into the editor and fool around some more
I'll just do a big nor statement for now, since i t's not there anyway.
have you heard of lua

lol. You still work for Downpour btw?
Yeah I've worked there for a while
great

How? Most missions are not linear in the slightest
You can customize lua however you want, you can make it entirely event based if you want.
What is there now is a scripting language. A visual one. It's just very limited

Does it do run it more than once?
every second in fact :)
What?

You are aware events can only be run once yes?
Updates right before points are awarded to the team with air superiority
Every kill?

> You are aware events can only be run once yes?
If it's true more than once
It will only run once

what is the CPU cost of an event?

what happens if you call stop/start on an event after a certain time, will it go again?

what happens if you call stop/start on an event after a certain time, will it go again?
No
Only once can an event run

how does it check whether the event has been run? does it keep a list by their ID's? or is it a property
You also can't respawn a destroyed unit. And an unspawned unit is considered alive
good question, I recommend you look into that yourself in the massive fuck-off class that is the editor's and tell us about it too pls!

what does the property "RTB Waypoint is Spawn" do for player spawns in multiplayer?
use spawn pos as RTB waypoint

Back all the way out to where you select the aircraft on the main menu, and use the Steam Workshop there

how big should a helicopter map be?
At 200kts, it takes the heli about 16 minutes to fly 100km (54 nm). Depending on how much traveling you want the players to do in order to get to the objective, you can use that as a starting point.

It is not currently possible to make tunnels with the editor in the game, correct?
It is not possible to create tunnels
Use an Event Sequence. Add a node with a separate entry condition for each one of those groups. Then it will only be checking one group at a time, reducing the performance cost. Also, this makes it easier to debug as each sequence node advancement gets logged in player.log, so you can see which group didn't trigger.

Air to air helicopter refueling when?
It's not about the fuel/range it's about the flight time. :/
Change the spawn point of the helicopter at certain checkpoints so if they die they wouldnt have to go all the way back.

Is there a way to make landing on a carrier an objective? Seems that only waypoint can be used for "landing" type objective. But the ships are moving .... maybe with some custom rule thing?
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/960626322730807306
Thank you. I'll give it a try

what do you mean by "choose the carrier"?
oh, you can pick the carrier at the waypoint!
yeah that. XD

You've done a LOT of debugging, haven't you? There's a whole thread just for your mission alone. XD
It's the game's fault I swear!
For real, yeah it's a pain to debug. Giving everything unique names (units and event sequence nodes) and reading the player.log makes debugging triggers and kills much easier.

Anyone have some general advice on designing missions that include both the AH and other vehicles in satisfying ways? I feel like the fixed wing vehicles end up often overshadowing the helicopter's role due to how quickly they can get from spawn to objective to objective
The AH-94's major advantage is its gun, which can kill a LOT of ground targets
1) spawn it *closer* than the jets

hello everyone, is there a quick guide about how the spawning works with the new multiplayer?
Players spawn on the map spawns
Hi guys,  I'm busy making a mission for MP (not that this should matter), but I'm struggling to spawn one unit only out of a collection of units (so I don't know this unit's end spawn location when I start the mission so it's basically random). All respective units are set to not spawn immediately.  I'm trying to use the Sequence Event to accomplish this, but I think I might be understanding it incorrectly.  How I currently have it set up: - Each node has an entry condition of Chance 15% - Each node has an exit condition of a check for if a global value is 0 (I have a global value set up to default to 0) - If a node has its entry condition matched (Chance 15%), it will spawn the respective unit (I have a node per unit) and then it sets the global value to 1  Every time I boot the level up, none of the units spawn (I even have the last node's entry condition simply set to check if the global value is still 0 meaning no units have spawned so the last one HAS to).  I have also initially tried setting only the entry condition of each node to Chance 15% AND if the global value is 0 (last node only checked for the global value = 0), yet this still did not work either.  So my question is basically this: If a node's entry condition IS NOT MET, do the other nodes even fire off?

Sequential events MUST fire in sequence. That is, sequence 2 cannot fire if sequence 1 doesn't. If the 15% for sequence 1 fails, then the entire rest of the sequence hangs right there.
You'd probably be best off just using one unit and giving it a bunch of alternate spawn locations

I am a software dev so fortunately that logic is all good haha.  Still thanks a bunch.  Final question though, but how do we test launch MP campaigns that are simply saved to disk?  As mentioned above I need to publish my changes to the workshop before being able to launch it (as far as I know since I can't see my mission anywhere else other than the MP host screen)
from the mission editor there should be a way to launch
I wish players would leave more feedback on steam for mission builder to know what to fix, improve

Is there a way to prevent a wingman from doing a vertical takeoff on the attack carrier? I have setup a training mission starting on the carrier, but instead of taxing and doing a short takeoff, it just go for a vertical one from the spawning point ...
Problem is vote is for the whole workshop item, so a full campaign getting a weird vote because of a specific mission .
A link to the workshop page item could be interesting

Hello, I created a campaign with one mission. I tested today with some people and tried to remove bugs. If you wanna try it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2792930907

all of them, except the F45
I forgot to say, it is multiplayer

How many people is it designed for? There's literally no information on the workshop page lol
5 or more
Good idea to include briefing notes on workshop page

Perhaps I need to set it up differently?
What would cause a wingman to not refuel at the tanker we're just behind when asked to do so? It definitely could have used some juice. Instead it keept flying off (to who knows where)
he probably has his refuel location set to somewhere that's not the air tanker.

it's RTB was set to "none", maybe it should be have been set to the tanker?

yea thatll probably fix it
actually, the wingman unit doesn't have a refuel location. The one set is the scenario info

are you sure or telling it to refuel and not rtb?
You don't have to use the option "Final" to end the game. Just use the option "pre required" objective. And mark the objective box as "required"
 As long as all objectives are completed the game wil end.
But which ones? The objectives won’t all be activated, and so won’t all be completed

But which ones? The objectives won’t all be activated, and so won’t all be completed
Then disable the box "required"
And use the pre-required or triggered option but not "Final".
Ok, so I can set it as preq, but don’t tick any objectives? Also I thought the required option meant the objective needed to be completed to complete the mission, which is my intention. Is the required option just for triggering the start of the objective?

Is there something in the logic I could use to trigger the RTB objective?
I’m thinking I could set flags each time an objective is triggered, then on completion. Flag is set to zero and at the end of each objective manually trigger an event that looks to see if all the flags are zero

Can a conditional event be enabled multiple times and will it work properly?

Can a conditional event be enabled multiple times and will it work properly?
Example scenario 2 of the 3 possible objectives are triggered. At the end of each those objectives there’s a conditional trigger enabled on completion of each that if flags associated with those objectives are all 0 (untriggered objectives should also be 0), then start RTB
Yes,

It looks like there is no way to make the player invincible. Is that correct?
... I wonder if having "triggered event" that repair the player everytime its damaged would work ...
isn't there an "invincible" flag you can set?

isn't there an "invincible" flag you can set?
For AI units, yes. None that I can find for the player
I wish there was a way to set an ETA for a sea unit/group when they are moving to  a waypoint ...

when testing a mission, you can make the player invunerable no?
yes, but in this case I'd like it to be invincible outside of testing
There is currently no option for that.

or am i thinking to simple here?
My thought is RTB start is triggered when when all possible obj flags are 0. If obj triggered add 1, when completed  sub 1. Each possible obj will have an associated flag. My mission has a static primary goal with random obj starting after it, so the RTB trigger check would be enabled after when the random objs initialize
I’ll need to experiment though

That works? I’d assume the mission would end after the last active objective is completed, as the final objective hasn’t started yet
Final objective will automatically start if there is no other objective active
Oh yeah, you'll need a temporary objective that gets canceled when the real objectives are rolled

After a few playthroughs it seemed pretty bug free, so I went ahead and uploaded it.  Feel free to leave any feedback or bugs encountered https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2793506276
You can edit the title and description in the Steam Workshop so you're not limited by the in-game editor character limits. So you don't have to make a comment lol.  Mobile doesn't have tags. What vehicle is this for? If it's multiplayer, you should probably list that in the description.

Is there a way in the editor to designate Bullseye points?
First create a waypoint for it, then set it under Edit -> Scenario Info
why do so many people call their map "pvp/freeflight"

Is there a way to get troops to stay in radius but not stay in the same 10 foot area? I set staying radius as a behavior and set the way point and they just walk around this tiny little area
Maybe have them patrol a path?
Guess that'll have to do

Maybe have them patrol a path?
Guess that'll have to do
You can set multiple paths, and randomly have each infantry choose which one they patrol. if you feel like making all those scripts. or can open the VTS in notepad and just copy-paste them

Hey, is there a way to make my player VTOL spawn in full of infantry to deliver them to the drop-off?
Is there not a Passengers button on the player unit properties. Likely not in mp though

6 infantry men is max for the av correct?
8
Thank you

can it contain a manpad?
Yup
Hell, it can contain 8 manpads

Can someone explain the rewards system to me?
also , how do I know who's team A and who's team b?
Team A is formally known as allies

also , how do I know who's team A and who's team b?

Team B is formally known as enemies

Is there no way to go back into map editor and make changes while working on the mission?
:sadge:
Yup

Where is the scenario editor located?
It's the mission editor
Found it

is there a way I can make an objective to both pilots to RTB to their own cruisers to complete the mission?
I think I found it
My paths are a bit separated from the cruisers, are they still going to follow them if assigned properly?

What's the action to fail the mission? (ex: oilrig destroyed)

What's the action to fail the mission? (ex: oilrig destroyed)
set a team B objective
It's a coop mission, no enemy players

so I just make a team b objective to destroy the rig?
yes
So you can do that with events?

So you can do that with events?
:KEKW_A:
no that is objectives

Isnt the ai going to start blasting the rig?
yes
That's not what we want

Can't I just make 5 actions failing all the objectives of team A if oilrig is destroyed?
would this work?
yeah?

This should still fail the mission though right?
I'll test it
I would assume so, but have no idea

wait do i have to be in ptb?
No, but you have to be creating a multiplayer scenario
oh

where can i do that?
To create a multiplayer scenario, create a multiplayer campaign, then create a scenario in it
ahhhhh

For proximity triggers, where do I set the proximity point?
does it create itself when I click "New trigger"
It's the Waypoint

Is it a bad idea to put manpads on an oil rig that can't be destroyed in order to complete a mission?
:PepeLaughing:
Feel like that's going to be almost impossible to complete without dying, there is like 0 cover cause it's in the middle of the ocean

What's the manpad targeting range?
Couple of km, but manpad missiles are extremely easy to dodge
And by dodge, I mean defeat using flares

If I voice-over the whole brief page, do you have a button to turn off the voice over in multiplayer if you want to read it yourself?
Negative
:bigsadge:

For a multiplayer mission, do you recommend just leaving it without a voice-over?
I guess it's personal preference
For briefing, since player will mostly talks, its better to not have notes voice.  Opposed to if you play singleplayer mission.

Is there a way to spawn infantery at the position of a moving vehicle (as a trigger)? I can spawn them on a trigger, but their position will be the original one (as set in the editor), not the position they should be at
Nope
ugh, thanks

yeah that's the problem ... Will they walk if I set a waypoint to them?
If you tell them to walk to the waypoint, yeah
You can do it immediately after spawning them

Anyone know what speed they are going to?
For a vehicle you can set the speed, but not for infantery units.
What does the "follow" mode do? I have seen that question posted a few times in this channel, but no one seems to know

What does the "follow" mode do? I have seen that question posted a few times in this channel, but no one seems to know
I'm gonna assume "Slow 10" is 10kph which sound like maybe it will be infantery speed
or is it 10m/s?

Looks like there's no way to get a UAVC to "protect" a moving unit, right?
i mean, you can make it fly in formation with an aircraft
but uhh, not a tank or anything

is it realistic to use an aircraft to escort a ground vehicle?
Orbitting a spot ?
I think having a UAVC orbiting a moving column not that un-realistic

the Manta? ... sorry forgot the acronym for it
you can have a big orbit radius and change the orbit point every 10 km
manta ucav yes

Will your mission will be that long?
Infantry are so slow that you can basically have the UCAV orbit a single waypoint and the infantry will never be out of range
yeah, that's a good idea

if the orbit point is "none", will it orbit the spawn point?
usually yes
Someone mentioned setting the orbit raduis ... but I haven't find a UI control in the editor to do so ...

difference between path and rail path?
no idea! lol
hopefully someone who's tested it knows

speaking of paths. I edited the VTS file to duplicate a path (and change the altitude of the points that compose it) and used for id the id of the last path + 1, but while the mission loads in the editor, that added path doesn't show up in the list. What give?
im sure they are just the same now.
as lots of people had problem with bridges with path so now its just sticks to the path set.

Did you put the friendly carrier speeds there too? They weren't last I checked
its been there for at least a year
i have all the healths of every unit also

Can anyone confirm if they've seen "Vehicle Control" events working in multiplayer?
Also has the non-targets list worked in MP
yes

Will a TEAM B manpad engage and shoot down an AI TEAM A aircraft?
Yes
Thanks

take off / wait is not landed / follow path?
Quick question for those that may know how to assist: Is there any easy way to determine if all players in a MP mission have landed near a waypoint?  If I use groupings and check if all players have landed, this does not work since not all MP spawn slots (that are also part of that group) have players. I also don't see anything in the lines of 'Active Player Units' or something like that so I take it the logical check for 'All Units in Group have landed' checks every unit assigned even if that unit has yet to have a player choose and spawn on it.  I have tried using the land objective, but I believe this completes if any player has landed in the defined radius. I want all active players to have to land
My mission has 2 mp spawns, a VTOL and an ah-94.  In the briefing room, the 2 available vehicles for spawn are both VTOL

Make sure you've saved and uploaded the version where the ah spawn has been set to be ah
They were both set to VTOL, sorry

Is there any way I can switch Bravo 1-1 vehicle with Alpha 1-1 vehicle? I've set-up all the voice-overs for the mission for Alpha 1-1 to be the AH-94, but in the brief room the VTOL is Alpha 1-1
I'm guessing I'd have to switch the cruisers around and re-configure the spawns and the paths?
:AE_PepeStare:

I'm guessing I'd have to switch the cruisers around and re-configure the spawns and the paths?

I dont think I set up unit groups, I just have team A and team B

Time (sec) = 5 means the message will play 5 sec after the game starts right?
After the event's triggered
5sec after that delayed trigger is enabled

Is there a way to create an objective dynamically? I'd like to setup a scenario where you have to fly to a hold-off position then (after a delay) get a message telling you to engage a specific target (with GPS coord provided at that moment).
No, but you can create a pile of objective/unit/GPS points, then pick one at random
Yeah, I suppose the objective could be "generic". Thanks @Skumby

is that possible to setup?
Looks like you're going to have to use a triggered objective instead
Oh, I could also make 2 objectives, one called RTB VTOL and another RTB AH94

What were you wanting with this?
each vehicle to have a waypoint back to their spawns
2 different cruisers

Okay, how do I specify that mp Spawn 1 has to be landed on a cruiser?
Cant connect the 3
There are AND and OR connectors

How do I integrate the created event trigger (the RTB one) into an objective that has a completion reward?
You don't put it in an event trigger 😛 There's an objective type that is completed by trigger
Yeah you said it but backwards, same thing I think?

Yeah you said it but backwards, same thing I think?
I think I did it
:clueless:

Any way to set a delay to a radio message on a conditional trigger?
I want a radio message to play when the tank is destroyed but not the second it happens
at least 5 seconds later

if I set the waypoint for the infantry I'm delivering, won't they try to swim to it before I pick them up?
Not sure what you mean
So I'm picking up infantry and dropping them off but they are running back to where I picked them up from

There isnt a button to remove the audio file from the brief page, do I just re-make it?
Interesting. Guess so
The game could use some built in TTS

Alright , last thing for today, any way to setup a waypoint for each vehicle at the start of the mission?
So a different waypoint to each vehicle
I'm not sure you can

Could they be dying from the burning VTOL somehow?
an enemy tank?
ye

will they still die to friendly damage?
no?
:lysMath:

the Receive Friendly Damage tag is new, maybe its bugged?
there is nothing friendly shooting at them
Reading between the lines, I believe they want them to take friendly damage so CAS can’t just nuke the entire beach from orbit

hi everyone, i'm working on my first mission rn and i need some help. All the AI planes want to take off from the same cat. I tried having them use taxi paths to the cats i want them to go to, but they would just turn around and try to get on the other cat. Am i missing something obvious?

It's pretty much just up to the tower handing out cat assignments. It *should* assign them to different cats though if a bunch of jets want to take off at once. I might suggest staggering the timing of giving the order to take off. If you're telling all the jets to take off at the same time, then they might ask be getting assigned the same cat because it's currently "empty" at the exact moment they are all requesting to take off.
I'll try that, thanks ^^

Not something I've come across before. You can't type in the correct value over the number?
No sir
Guess you're stuck then

Once I upload the mission to steam, can I still make adjustments and update it?
Yup
:peepoGlad:

"Requires link" do I just put a radar next to it or is there anything else to it?
On one of them, the unit properties has a button to assign radars to launchers, or launchers to radars. Can't remember which way around it goes
Thank you

Any way to make infantry follow an IRAPC without assigning the path to each one?
There is a follow option but Idk what he's following
I have no idea what Follow does

how do I create a unit?
hmm
And then tell the group to follow a path in the line formation

no button to create a unit?
Its on the unit properties
got it thanks

Do you have other objectives that have start mode Immediate?
Yes but those dont have auto set waypoint checked
Fixed

are they going to drive under the textures?
As long as it's somewhere close, they'll drive along the ground surface. I'm not sure how far away it'd need to be for them to burrow/fly, or if they even can
ok

Any way to make rocket boats to engage friendly air vehicles?
They'll only engage extremely slow moving/hovering air vehicles
Most air vehicles will fly faster than their rockets

Haven't shot at us, is their range that low?
we were at about 15-20km and they didnt engage us
They fire IR missiles, so anything more than 5km will be pushing it

anything on wheels that is long range?
Found it
The only thing that can move and fire at those sorts of ranges is the MAD-4, and it can't move and fire

so if I have a mad-4 rolling on a path,it wont stop to fire?
Nope
ok

Do I need to do anything special to make a mission multiplayer?
You need to create a multiplayer campaign, then make a scenario in that campaign

Create mission. Pick map. Place player, friends and enemies. Add objectives. Add mission title, description and briefing. Publish to Steam Workshop

Is there any way to make the UI within the Editor not insanely small?
It's not insanely small for me, so *shrug*
I am playing on a 4k Monitor and the Letters are literally the size of an ants foot.

hoe do i rotate units for exampl?
I forgor 💀
Q and E

neat. lets say i want to place a unit in the sky, in flight, is ther a way to change the curser altidude with buttons like wasdqe, or do i have to type in an altidue?
Hold shift and spin the mousewheel
neat

rn, my very simple scenario i want to make is, you take off as an av42 with a single av42 as wingmen, to kill one drone carrier and its drones. i want the wingmen av42 to take off, orbit, and form up once the player is in the air. how do i set up this behavior wof the AI av42?
Using events
Do you want it to take off before the player, or after them?

Do you want it to take off before the player, or after them?
they take off while the player starts up the aircraft, and then forms up on them after the player took off
Trickier, as there's no decent trigger for "starts up the aircraft"

after the player took off and reaches a certain altidue maybe?
You can test for that, yes
Check out the Events tab on the right, and then the Triggered tab at the top of that

so, i f i want the ai to take off immediatly after mission start, i put its behavior to "takeoff"?
Be cautious of the Is Landed state, as player aircraft can spawn a few inches in the air, which counts as flying
Yeah, if it's set to takeoff, it'll taxi and takeoff if it can't take off vertically

how to set that state?
You can't set it. You can test for it though, in the triggered event conditional editor (and other things which allow you to set conditions)
i have made it dependend on altitude and airspeed of the player for now, but how do i link it to the ai doing something?

What've you created that in? A triggered event?
yes

What've you created that in? A triggered event?
yes
i think?

Can you post a screenshot of the triggered event window? The internet doesn't have oen
i think i got it anyways...
it looks like this now, with the trigger conditions and logic stuff being the above image

wont "from on pilot" do?
Not without setting the target leader field
Every aircraft has a pilot, technically

i want the ship to follow a path, i have created one, set the direction, and moved the carrier at the end. will it automatically moce to the first point of the path upon mission start?
If you've set the path to be its default path (in its unit properties) it'll move to the closest point, and follow it
neat

whats the default behavior of an ai aircraft after it took off and didnt get any other instructions? the time between "is in the air" and "Player is in the air, causing it to form up"
in my case
It'll just orbit the airfield.

perfect. Do ai struggle with terrain when in a orbit state? it will take off vertically, and the airfield on "the Island" has those mountains around it...
They're reasonably good at avoiding terrain
i have killed many people by telling them to form up and then flying too low or close to obstacles

will try that if it crashes. If i save a scenario, will it automatically show up in the Custom missions tab? also, i didnt see any way to make it for a specific aircraft...
It'll appear in the custom missions tab, yeah. You set the aircraft that the mission is for in the Scenario Settings (or something like that). It's in one of the menus at the top
ah okay

Is there a way to run mission editor in desktop mode? My laptop, which is my primary PC, has a 960m graphics card, i7 processor, and 16 GB ram. I only wish to create/edit missions and maps. My gaming pc is only for gaming and is attached to my TV & entertainment.
just open the game without a vr headset plugged in
Ethan, I did that. However, there is an end user license agreement for which I cannot accept without a VR controller

Did you edit the right one?
There is more than one?
The one you want to change is in appdata\roaming

hoe do i tie a Waypoint to a unit so it moves with it?
You can’t

hoe do i tie a Waypoint to a unit so it moves with it?
You can’t
eh?

okay, i want the carrier to be marked with a waypoint that move with it, how do i do that?
In-game waypoints can be mission editor waypoints, or ossasionally units
You can’t

Were they the target of a land or destroy or other objective?
The mission i made, no, it was a rendezvous type mission. Fly to this cruiser, then fly cap until it reaches land
So yeah it was an objective that created the in game waypoint

alright, i want the simple objective of the player having to destroy the drone carrier and all the drones together with his wingmen. would that work?
Use the Waypoint entry in the top bit
Ahz

i know how to make a immediate objective and its waypoint upon mission startup, but i i want a new objective to pop up once the player gets to a certain location, how do i do that?
So you could have one objective for the search bit, which is completed when you find it, starts another objective, to destroy it, which sets the objective on the unit
1st objective: search this area for carrier. Success condition is being within X meters of the ship, which triggers objective 2

how do i give an aobjective a trigger? ai, ship found= start destroy obj
Each new objective you force to start through an event, or you can have objectives start based on when previous objectives are finished
For the objective, set the start type to prereq, and tick the search objective

what unit is this slider? nautical miles? meters? km?
nvm the box below explains it
Everything is meters

i want the objective to be completed once the player is within a certain range of the carrier, but how do i set a "search for" obj that reacts when the carrier is found?
Can you take a screenshot of the options for Objective Type plz
those are the only types of objectives i can set, and the "fly to" wich is the closest to what i need only lets me pick manually set, static waypoints. the "destroy" type lets me select the carrier asa waypoint

probably. A km is not too far or too close right? i might have to tweak that though, as aviation, games in general, and ESPECIALLY this game tend to screw up my sense of scale a lot
The drone cruiser does have a vertical launch missile rack
1000 seems a lot, until you realise that this is less than the min distance for most weapons lol

is there some sort of resource, apart from the wiki, that has details on each units capabilities and ranges?
Nope, because they’re so dependent on other factors
could i set the carrier to only attack once discovered?

could i set the carrier to only attack once discovered?
Yes
There’s a tick box on the unit properties for their ability to attack, and you can use events to turn it back on

should i tick the Engage box?
Yup
what does "PreReqs" standfor, and is this the correct setup to start a new obj upon completion of the last one?

what does "PreReqs" standfor, and is this the correct setup to start a new obj upon completion of the last one?
Prerequisites
And yes

shall i leave it as this start mode?
Tick the previous objective to the left
this?

The first objective should have a different start type (Initial? Start up?)
immediate?
All the rest should have start type prereq with the previous objective ticked

so, there are multible ways to reach the same result in the end?
yes
it's just a matter of organizing them

in that case, like this?
i removed the condition for the player to be near the carrier to finish the objective, and replaced it by being triggered by the "offensive" event
other way around lol

it begins the destroy carrier objective though?
once the search is complete, you destroy it
"Start Event" = When this objective is given to the player, do these things. So you're telling the game, as soon as I give the player the "Search Carrier" objective, I want you to then begin the objective "Destroy Targets"

does ai have the same trouble using weapons that are not faf as players? like, should i give the ai AV42 Agm114 or Agm65?
I expect the AI will be fine at using any AGMs you give it
though you run the risk of the AI just killing the carrier by itself and player wondering what he was there for. XD

btw, i set an obj start mode to triggered, where do i set the trigger condidtion for it? rn, i only know how to use the prereqs and immediate modes
I generally like to give differing missions to the player and AI. something along the lines of "you bring bombs/AGMs/etc to kill these targets, your wingman will bring air-to-air missiles to cover you from enemy fighter threats" or the reverse.
I believe the only way to start that is with an event action

ah, so setting it to triggered, it will let me add it to actions performed by events?
i might do that, starting the search obj after take off, and the firt obj being just to take off
sort of? Again, it's just an alternate way of starting an objective

sort of? Again, it's just an alternate way of starting an objective
It's used more for things like randomized objectives, when you don't know the exact order you want objectives to be completed in (for which you would just use a series of Prereq style objectives)
if you wanted to start search after take off, that's something that will never change, and that's better suited just having the search obj be a prereq objective, and tick "take off"

what would be the best way to detect if a player has taken off, apart from airspeed and alt?
That's actually probably the best way to do it.
there is the "Is not landed" condition, but that will fire as soon as you're a centimeter off the ground lol

Is there a way for me to make aircrafts spawn after a base is destroyed? Like an event? If so how can I do it?
Airbases don't get destroyed. They can only change factions.
What I meant is when an objective is complete

is there a way to have a ships radar off and have it not engage anything until a certain event is triggered, ie, getting within a certain distance of it? I tried setting the "engage enemies" box off, but i was still getting pinged by its radar and being shot at, Waaay before i got within the range i set
this didnt work. the "engage enemies" box is off in the units own settings.
oooooh i had it set sop that the carrier was set to engage as soon as the search obj starts lmao

alright, if i want to set up a small fleet travelling in formation next to each other, whats the best way to do that? Do i set baths for each of them next to each other, or can i just give all of them the same patch and they will automatically hold formation? also, do all ships and boats travel at the same speeds?
If you add them all to the same unit group they will automatically make a formation
amazing

how do i tell a group? i only found a way to tell each unit individually
i set them all as the same group, but i dont see a way to tell an entire group to follow a patch. i punched it into each units manually to follow the same path
I believe there's an event for telling a Unit Group to do something. But AFAIK if you tell the first unit in the group to follow a path, everyone else automatically follows the leader. This does mean that if you put units in a group, *you cannot separate them.*

any way to make gunboats and drone carriers move the same speed?
they all follow the path, but at diffrent speeds, and right behind each other. should i delete the path out of all but one and just keep them as a group?
Use a timed event, Starting Immediately, to give the unit group an event action to follow the path

they all follow the path, but at diffrent speeds, and right behind each other. should i delete the path out of all but one and just keep them as a group?
Use a timed event, Starting Immediately, to give the unit group an event action to follow the path
it only spawns in the group once the player is close to the search waypoint

did that, now delete the path out of the individual units?
so, as soon as the player is locking any of the units with either tgp or arad, the carrier group gets set to engage
Won’t help, won’t harm. The event action will override the default action

Hi Devoss, I use the chance logic box set to 50% in a conditional trigger event to get a random chance of say then spawning a unit. Is this the best way of randomising stuff? Seen a post ages ago mentioning using global values but can't figure out how this would work.
i want to have a troop of infantr, and a convoy of vehicles driving a loop around the airbase so it seems more busy and interesting. i have asingned the infantry and the vehicles to group, and given all of them paths and the correct behavior, but they do not move in the mission
i now set a triggered event with the trigger being "player is landed" wich ias a given at the start of the mission, and the action being both groups being send to their respective paths

Anyone know why some of my ai pilots don't know how to take off? Sometimes they veer off course and start doing donuts cuz they try to taxi back to the runway in full AB
Yep. Arranging into formation
If they get even a little bit off the ground, like a bounce or spawning in just above ground level, they'll assume they've taken off and try to fly

Is there any way to avoid it or fix it? Or just don't spawn enemies on the ground..?
Depends what's causing it. What's the circumstances where they do it?
Well, I spawn them at an airfield and give them a takeoff order. It's a flight of four and they're all given the TO command as a unit group. They taxi normally and then try to takeoff. It's not always happening, but when it does it clogs the entire airfield until the stunt pilot manages to take off (that happened once) or is destroyed.

The airfield is situated on top of a plateau and it had to be significantly flattened when I placed the airfield in the map editor. Maybe thats the case?

I got nothing. Weird
Are you giving them the order the same time you spawn them?

Are you giving them the order the same time you spawn them?
Oh they taxi then mess up on take off. Maybe try staggering the take off orders? Other than that i have no further ideas
Do you mean the initial command to take off(when they are still in the hangars), or them entering the runway?

nope. you could just unplug the VR headset though lol
but it'll still start SteamVR

Can't get rtb way point is spawn to work on stable mp campaign editor. X1 ah-94 initial spawn point on airfield heli pad. Want respawn to be away from airbase in mountains - set way point on another heli pad in alt location ticked rtb way point is spawn and then ensured in edit scenarios under settings rtb way point is set as alt. Still respawns at airfield? Any suggestions please.
Also are rocket artillery enemy ai not working properly? Set them 6km out (pop up says they engage 2-8km) and prioritises targets on the airfield but they just keep targeting a section of the airbase runway - is there a certain type of unit they will/won't attack - I've tried infantry, refuel points , big storage tents and (which in hindsight is probably wrong) parked av42s. What am I missing please?
I'm pretty sure rocket artillery can only fire at a point you specify. they do not attempt to target units (because they can't see them, anyways), they just shoot directly at the waypoint you give them

so if your waypoint for the airport is just in the center of the runway, and you tell them to attack the airport waypoint.... then they're firing at the runway

If i'm following correctly you're trying to move a player spawn and have your rtb waypoint change with your moving spawn?
how can i get ai pilots that take off before me to form up? i'm in the same flight group and player command is set to group only

Try setting a trigger so that when you're airborn or you reach 'x' altitude above ground your wingmen then form up on you (leader or specific unit).

is it maybe because they don't recognize me as leader since they took off before me?
Any way to know where is NORTH in the mission editor
set cursor heading 0

Is this button only bugged for me or anyone else??
SO annoying
doesnt playback the radio call sometimes

is there any way to trigger a radio voice line when the vtol is about to crash? (lost engines, heavy damage etc)
I know you can trigger one if the health is below a certain point
its very hard to tell if a player is about to crash

Is it correct that an AI wingman won’t land at a Refuel point that isn’t an official airbase?
yes and no. you can have aircraft both friendly or enemy land anywhere that is allowed to land. in one mission I even had an enemy vtol capable bomber land on a friendly medium size boat and 'capture' it via triggers. but as far as refueling goes, I believe they will need an airbase, but I'm not sure on that. I think they need to be able to access the tents in the airbase's to resupply. maybe someone else can verify that part
Alright, thanks

how do I make enemy planes attack certain positions?
Planes will attack any enemy unit they find. You generally just need to get them somewhere near where you want them
Are you looking for something different to that?

Are you looking for something different to that?
yeah no, thats perfect. Thank you
If you want them to be focused in their murder, you can give them priority targets using the event action

Here's one for you guys - I'm trying to do a reward mechanic in an MP mission, where completing a side-task gives you more budget. The "Destroy" objective, for example, provides this mechanic. However I want it on a simple drop-off objective. This has a "Completion Reward" value, which I've set, but it doesn't seem to be financial credits as completing the goal didn't change the budget. Am I missing a trick, am I doing it wrong, is it bugged or is it not possible?
I'm not sure if rewards work like that.
I've never used them

static yes. moving no
crap. i assume infantry and other ground units just cant exist on moving ships?

crap. i assume infantry and other ground units just cant exist on moving ships?
They have no physics
The ship will just move out from under them

does it have to be static throughout the whole mission, or can i make it stop and start?
if it move after they on the shgip they will slip as the ship move
You also can’t set a unit as the waypoint for a drop off

how do I add another base?
Bases can only be created in the map editor
You can make farp-like assembles in the scenario editor

Score is... kills isn't it? I don't think your objectives can give kills?
Or is there a different way to add points to score
I'm guessing the score total there is actually kills+your 4 objectives, so it went over 100 at some point when 25 was added to it, so it never exactly equaled 100

Hi skumby - just wanted to try some stuff in the editor before coming back to you. Apologies, I now understand what you mean about me having it back to front and can now move the spawn point using the method/trigger event Devoss mentioned. But I wanted to see what the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' check box actually did when checked - as this was what was confusing me. Sorry this is long winded but would appreciate your thoughts - I place a single mp AH-94 (me) on an airfield helipad - this is in stable editor. I don't check the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box in the Ah-94 unit settings - and I don't  choose any waypoint in the edit scenarios - RTB Waypoint option to set Nav RTB button. Go into game - airborne - press RTB in Nav MFD - nothing comes up - as expected. I then check the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box in the AH-94 unit settings - assuming this means - whatever the spawn point is for this unit that is what will show in the Nav screen as the RTB point? - start mission - airborne - get well away from spawn - press RTB in Nav screen - nothing appears. Back to editor - leave 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box checked in AH-94 unit settings and add waypoint to the edit/scenario RTB Waypoint - one well away from the airfield. Start mission - airborne - hit RTB button in NAV MFD and it shows path to waypoint I set in edit/scenario/ RTB Waypoint modal. What should checking the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box do? - and should it override any waypoint in the edit/scenario/RTB waypoint modal - because in the test scenario it didn't.
Do the MP Spawn unit properties have an RTB waypoint too? I know there's one in the scenario options for SP missions
No - just the check box.

Do the MP Spawn unit properties have an RTB waypoint too? I know there's one in the scenario options for SP missions

I would expect that if that tickbox is ticked, when the player belonging to that spawn point presses the RTB button on NAV, it'll set their waypoint to be their spawn point

are you sure the carrier and/or drones has "Engage Enemies" checked?
Drones can't carry A2A missiles anyways, AFAIK
There’s no way to order the drones to do anything, as they don’t exist in the mission editor. They’ll auto aggro on enemies if they get close enough

i assume there is no way to change the  status of a unit out of being invincible, but instead we should use the "destroy" action?

I have a question about objective info and how that's presented in your objective mfd page in game. I've got an objective where you need to destroy a number of hostile units, however not all of them are spawned in right away and will be spawned throughout the objective. Will the objectives mfd page only show you the count of targets that have spawned, incrementing the count as more spawn in? Or does it also show you the unspawned ones too as a total count of units to destroy?

It will include unspawned units. Unspawned units are considered alive until spawned in and destroyed.
If you want the total number to be dynamic, you have to use a conditional objective.

Is there way to make a unit "un-invincible"  after its been set as invincible? Currently, I only see an option to set unit as invincible.
how would you change the required number dynamically using conditional triggers?
Well, you can't change the counter dynamically. But if you're willing to forfeit the unit counter then it's just a matter of setting up the right condition tree.

Alright, I think i've got an idea of what to do from here. Thanks for the help!

If your objective's start mode is set to 'Triggered' but it's also set to 'Required', will it still be required to be completed for mission success if left untriggered?
Nope. The mission ends when all **active required** objectives are completed. Inactive required objectives are ignored.
If you're making use of that you have to be extra careful that the next required objective is activated before the previous required objectives are completed, or else the mission will end early.

I have a convoy of units, i've set up their path, formation is set to column, but when they go on bridge only the first unit in group is *on* the bridge, the rest is in the water below. Any ideas on how to fix that? How can you make a convoy not drive under the bridge?
I, uh, "fixed" that in one of my missions by making the units *not* a group, so they don't try to create a formation at all. Just a bunch of units individually following a path that all happen to be in a line. XD
does the "PreReqs" start mode for an objective require all of the ticked objectives to be finished, or only one? i ant to have multible pick up objectives, that all come together at a single drop off obj

does the "PreReqs" start mode for an objective require all of the ticked objectives to be finished, or only one? i ant to have multible pick up objectives, that all come together at a single drop off obj
no wait i can just set the mode to trigger and start the dropoff by having each pickup trigger it
It requires them all to be completed

i assume the "completed event" action triggers once an event is completed?
i just set each of the pick up objectives to trigger the drop off one individually
For an objective, the Completed event actions are performed after the objective is completed

a mission can be completed if there are untriggered and unfinished obj left?
Yup
A mission completes if there's no active objectives left

i i force quip a loadout, can the player land and rearm to get a new loadout?
No
oh

What would be stopping that if you gave them free access to all weapons?
i want the equip they spawn with to be forced and a specific one, but then be able to choose their own later
I'm reasonably sure you can't do that. If you give them the ability to choose a loadout, they'll get the loadout screen when they start the mission, and will be able to pick anything you've allowed there

Hmmm .. strange placement of mobile ground units in rendered game.  I made a small island with city painted fairly dense and put many copies of SAAW, and other Mobile forces into radius roaming patrols and when I tested the mission it worked well but when I tested it through the MP lobby some units were misplaced in the water. I did have apposing units overlapping in some areas and thought that might be the case so I decide on a neutral zone and deleted all units inside. It seems to have fixed the issue but could use more testing. Wondering if bug or feature ?
Ground units in the water is always a bug
they were fishfood for sure. I tried to fly out and search but could not see anything. they did show up on the Nav though.

Max players in one lobby is 16 so that means a pvp mission can be 8v8 max or 16 on each team so 16v16?
16 total

Can AI F-45 do short takeoff from the attack carrier? It seems it just taxi to it and stay there (wings still up)
You can use R to skip putting on the helmet, but you must set the scenario to no customization.  Once in, use Insert to pop into debug cam, [ and ] to swap units. Tab toggles a simple gun to shoot things with.  It's more just for mission testing purposes
I noticed this issue on my modded carriers. They taxi forward but get stuck mid turn and fail to completely take off. It's like 50/50 if they manage to take off or not

Is that on the vanilla Wasp LHD? If so, it might be a bug with the F-45s ability to STOL
Cause, afaik, the AV-42 doing STOL worked every time
Both modded and vanilla

I set a path on a highway, but the vehicles set to use that path will not move. Any suggestion to what could be the reason?
`Default Behavior` is set to "Path" and `Default Path` is set to that path?
yes

`Default Behavior` is set to "Path" and `Default Path` is set to that path?
yes
if you have a bunch of vehicles in the same group, can ypu just set the lead one for a path and have the other verhicles set to "follow"? Not the case with the issue I was reporting above

Honestly I forget if that works. The most reliable way to make them move in formation is to use an action to tell the **group** to path.
Thanks @Sypwn , I will try that

Aren't they all drones? Autonomous Superiority Fighter?
ASF is the name of the majority of their planes
Minus the bomber and AWACS

Yeah they do gun runs
while vtoling?

What's the range on the DMS Cruiser's SAM turrets and radar?
Id have to calculate per-aircraft to get radar range, the SAM will fire at 14.5km
But, the RIM-67B isn't a very good missile, its fairly easy to dodge

how do you switch focus on units in the dev cam?
`[` and `]`
oh crap those are diffrent on german keyboards

why are my units not getting destroyed when i set them to? They are invincible, but only because i want them to die at a certain point and not earlier. I have at least two examples of units just not exploding when commaned
Invincible probably prevents it.
it didnt in my last few tests though...

they can also crash into a mountain anddie that way, because they went 1000m off course of the path i set them to follow. why mountains but not the power of god himself?
cant do that. can only set them as invincible, not the other way around
Just uncheck the box and I think that'll do it

oh that action changes the status?
neat
do the explosions that are part of death animations also deal damage like ordanance to nearby units?

do the explosions that are part of death animations also deal damage like ordanance to nearby units?
Im pretty sure they dont
you could prob test by putting two tents next to each other, tents are super week but have a massive explosion

If you tell an AV-42C to load passengers and then tell it to take off, will it wait for the passengers to board?
No
Alright, I guess I'll just set a time delay

What is the max effective range of the MPA-155 artillery? The wiki lists max range for the RAT but not the MPA-155.
Unlike the RAT,  I don't see a hard coded maximum engagment range, the bullets can exist for 2 minutes before self detonating traveling at 510 m/s (I think)
So quick math would say it should be able to fire at a 45 degree angle for a range of 26.3km

wait do bullets have air resistance in vtol?
I have no idea
noe

It's kind of like being a meat eater. You could think about all of the pain, suffering and hard decisions that go into meat production (or military engagements)  But why do that to yourself? 😉
Wasn't 30 degrees optimal firing angle for range?
depends if you include air resistance

Wasn't 30 degrees optimal firing angle for range?
depends if you include air resistance
As bullets don't have resist in vtol,  best is 45

are you being locked by it?
No, just the passive ping
Oh thats not detected

Does the mission maker have a trigger to clean up dead units in an area? I wonder if that would help with the CPU melting at Charlie sector on dyn lib?
Nope, lol
I've asked for it

If a group lead unit has alternate spawn location, will they also be applied to the rest of the group? If not, how do you set up an alternate spawn identical point for a whole group?
If you set a unit's group set then there's an extra check box in the Alt Spawn tab called "Sync Group" that does exactly what you want.
ah, that's what it is for. Great. Thank you

so, you have to have alt-spawn for each unit in the group, right?
Yes, if the number of alt-spawns don't match then it will automatically add extra alt-spawns to lacking units until they do. But those extras will all have default properties.
do i have to sync-group for each unit or just the lead?

do i have to sync-group for each unit or just the lead?
checking it for one checks it for them all
i see. that make sense

Hi Sypwn - could you just clarify how the alt spawn weighting works. If I have say just one other alt spawn - so two in total - to get a 50/50 chance of either being used do I set them both to 100 (as Spawn 1 defaults to 100) or do I set spawn 2 to 50?.
You set them both to 100

Is there a way to loop events in the mission editor? I'm trying to figure out a way to make a sneaky SAM battery that only lights up its radar for thirty seconds at a time.
The only workaround I found was really, really stupid.
No way to do loops, your best option is to copy and paste the events a few hundred times

That event trigger will only happen once right?
Oh, will it? I was hoping it could happen repeatedly.
it was my understanding that basically all events/triggers can only happen once

Oh, will it? I was hoping it could happen repeatedly.

I was going to keep a single infantry unit walking back and forth for hours.

how do you get all of that for the editor??
Static Objects menu on the right
allows you to place a bunch of things

If you kill-all a group, do they disappear or just burst into flame/explode/die?
They burst into flames
They’ll even do death radio calls if they’re in your group

Will units follow roads preferentially do do I need to make the path very explicit?
Ground units have no path finding at all
So if I want a tank to follow a road, I have to put their path very explicitly on the road

Is there a way to convert singleplayer scenarios to multiplayer?
The testing cycle for MP missions is insane.  In SP you can just go right into testing.  In MP you have to go through the lobby first
If you are the creator yes

and what about the other way around, convert from MP to SP so I can test faster?
and if so, how is this done?
in both directions

and if so, how is this done?
in both directions
The only way I know of is by hand-editing the mission files in notepad

like when a teams death count increases can I spawn something?
they're up on that hill
They're firing clean over the road and landing in the lake

maybe there's an on-death event?
Events can only fire once
not that i have found.

Is there any talk of allowing some kind of scripting? LUA, python, or even c# for the editor?
oh man, if each event can only fire once then you can't even do territorial tug of war
everything can only START as one side and flip over to the other side once

Any other hopes and dreams I can  piss on? 😛
Jetborne workshop support yes
Man...it wouldn't even be that bad if arty could hit it's targets

and events were intentionally hamstrung?
yes

What's the best way to take fully rendered screenshots for mission briefs? anyone got any pro tips? Only thing is know to do is fly by screenshots which is a bit of a pain and makes muh image quality.
When you spawn in, you can press the insert key on your keyboard to activate a debug camera, letting you move around the map at will and freely take screenshots
(this is done on the flatscreen and not in VR)

nice to have a tool for debugging missions too though, already has been useful quite a bit.   Also, does anyone know of a good way to detect which alt spawn a unit is at? ive tired using the conditional editor with the (unit) near waypoint, and it doesn't seem to work sadly
> ive tired using the conditional editor with the (unit) near waypoint, and it doesn't seem to work sadly  This is exactly how I do it. It works for me.
Note that "Unit near waypoint" and "UniltList any near waypoint" seem to give different results sometimes. I think one is spherical distance and the other is cylindrical.

Hmm, I'm only using "Unit near waypoint" and cranked up the radius to ensure it was in the area with no luck. The only thing I can think that might be different is that my unit spawns immediately, although I did try with a 6s delay with no luck either. I'll have to do some more trouble shooting. Maybe it has to do with it being a multi part navel unit somehow? Or that it spawns too soon?
This is the logic I'm using that doesn't seem to work, is this at all different then what you use?
That looks fine. Can you jump in voice chat and show me around more of the mission?

Are there any good communities for playtesting and sharing mission files?
Is there a way to temporary hide units/groups? E.g. a infantry team hides in a building before moving out ... Can't seems to find a way to do so.
They can walk through the walls of the building. You can also not spawn the infantry until you want them

Reloading the mission after Infantry and objective is in  fixed it
If the path end on a building, they will stand on the roof … 🙁

What if the path ends inside a building?
You can’t. The editor won’t let you do that. I suppose u could edit the altitude if the point in a text editor
I swear it used to let you slide the cursor under buildings, but I just tested it and you can't

Will armored units follow a mountainous path (no cliff)? I see the path line in the editor goes into the ground at some location ...
They'll happily drive up sheer cliffs and along the ocean floor
they really will

Anyone know how many time a MANPAD equipped infantry unit will shoot? It seems they fire more than once ... And what's their reload time? Seems it cannot be changed ...
I believe they can fire forever
They’ve got those infinite rocket boxes from HL2

they reload after every shot right?
ugh
They’ll not fire again until their previous missile is resolved

Anyone know what distance (say in Metres so I can use the measure tool in the editor) an enemy tank will engage a friendly tank if they have line of sight?
2km
nope, it's broken

Is there a limit for the amount of slides the briefing can have? The most I have seen is 20. I want to make a MP target practice mission for all aircraft and have the briefing explain the basics of all the weapons, but I'm not sure 20 will be enough.

Is it possible to load a local MP campaign (for testing) when creating a lobby, or are only Workshop campaign available?

Sadly you can not.
~~Oh. There's no flag like that you can set for any workshop missions. Just put it in the title.~~

Wait are you talking about how you can have two tabs for campaigns one being the mission and the other training?
Hmm ... So, I converted a couple of SP missions to MP, and I'm now trying to create a MP campaign for it. But when I create the campaign, they are not showing-up in the list of missions to pick (for inclusion). I recall that when I created last a campaign, I could pick the missions I had created separately
Yeah, I guess. It's okay if it's not possible though. I just modified the missions to be not training. But they still are not showing-up

I have a very simple scenario with some ally cruisers facing off against a drone launch and a hanfull of rocket boats.  My cruisers attack fine with your anti-ship missiles

So why don't the rocket boats fire?
maybe its too close, or maybe they dont attack visually? idk, i have never used them before
Also, Are you use the drone carrier doesn't have ciws?  I could swear I've seen them defend themselves from missiles

i assume the same as the MRLS truck

So...what I saw was a fluke?
I'm just surprised you didn't already know that, tbh
they were shooting atmme or an Ai and happened to hit a missile

What's the range on the allied cruiser naval gun?

Cheese I wrote script to do that for missiles, want me to just modify it for units?

No
Unfortunately not

Thanks Skumby. I was wondering because this is what I did, and I noticed some strange behavior where after the pickup, the av42 started driving back home instead of taking off

I flew the mission again and it happened also. Dunno what's the deal. Maybe it's having a hard time taking off because of weight?

Technically if the carrier is stationary you might be able to? Not sure if it will spawn you grounded in that situation.

How would you setup for a unit to randomly pick one path or another? Two different events each with a chance node in the conditional? But then there's always a chance it won't pick either ...
Conditional actions are what you’re looking for. Check out the System event action category

For ground units - the stayinradius behavior where do you define the radius they stay in

is it possible to make a mission (singleplayer or multiplayer) where you can play exclusively as REDFOR?
The ones without a waypoint are likely heading to (0,0)
the game won't let me publish a multiplayer campaign mission that doesn't have at least one BLUFOR player spawn

is that just a bug?
You might have answered your own question there
Not sure if it’s intended, but if that’s how it is, that’s how it is

What if you create a BLUFOR spawn, but set the team size to 0?
whats an orbit point
a point to orbit

how do i set the orbit point?
and yeah, ai planes
ohh

what happens to an ai plane if it's given now orbit point or path?
You mean *no* orbit point or path? In that case it will use its own spawn point as a fallback orbit point.
Oh ok, thank you

If one updates a workshop campaign, does it get automatically updated to everyone that downloaded it (when they start VTOL VR)?
after testing
I have found that more aircraft than player slots are available

hey does anyone know how to automatically despawn enemies after an objective is completed?
yeet them out of existance
you can delete them by exploding them

like setting a kill all command when the objective is completed?
i just dont want a ton of dead stuff killing the fps
It's probably much better for your CPU to kill them than to keep them alive

do they phase through like jettisonned weapons?
Is there a timer as well? Iv killed AI on the ground and a few seconds later they vanish

Quick question: if I make a multiplayer campaign where it's 2 aircraft carrier groups vs each other and one of the enemy carriers get sunk, will the players who were assigned to that carrier automatically spawn on the other carrier? Or will they be lost in purgatory?
Nope. I think they will die on spawn if that part of the carrier is flooded. You can use a trigger to move the spawn point when the carrier sinks, but it has to be to a static air or ground location, not on a carrier. Or you could create enough spawn points on both carriers and let them sort it out in the lobby. Alpha = carrier 1, Bravo = carrier 2, and cap the team size.
how do I finalize the mission. I can't seem to find a command for ending, or final etc... Does it just know?

how do I finalize the mission. I can't seem to find a command for ending, or final etc... Does it just know?
If there are no more active objectives left, then the mission ends in success.
If there are no more **required** objectives left.

Any suggestions to what could be causing that?
A weird path. Weird terrain around the point they get stuck. Unusual method to order them to follow the path. Random chance
I’m still very new to the editor. Struggling with making ground AI work. But it could be all the units try following the exact same point and end up clipping. Could test the follow behavior on some of them

Are they actually in a group? How are you telling them to follow the path?
Yes. I have a timed event that set the path for them to follow
If you watch them when the timed event fires, what do they do?

If you watch them when the timed event fires, what do they do?
I assume they start off not in a tactical blob. Do they vanish, or move underground, or start humping?
I don’t know, it’a far out from the player spawn point

Move it temporarily for testing, or use the insert debug camera

Does the objective have a waypoint set? Does it have the auto set waypoint tick box ticked?
Ah auto set waypoint was off. Cheers
it works in mp

What is the best resolution for the mission and campaign images?
Campaign image must be below 1MB to be allowed to upload to workshop. Other than that, as high as you can go.
Awesome. Thank you for the quick reply

If one set  the objective type to "land" in a MP mission. Will that mean that all players have to land, or just whoever land first there complete the objective?
I think it may have been my "command" to set the formation to "column" that caused that issue. I eventually changed the role of that group to not roaming around, otherwise, they were moving as they should (after not setting the formation), but some where driving on the roof of the houses (the path is in a city)
Any player on that team.

how do you lauch a mission from the mission editor with the quest 2?
I just have to start the game through air link. Go to the editor then on your pc launch scenario
ok. thanks. it wont work on a multiplayer scenario for some reason

"Missions" don't spawn. Are you talking about units? Or player spawns?
Units have a built-in feature called "alt spawns" that do exactly what you want.
Thanks I’ll take a look at that!

I want to have actual ground crew my wingmen has to drop off at the fob. I dont want the real Spot to be active before the crew is on the ground, and want it to be disabled if all of them die.
But I can't spawn it in later or kill it.

what would be the next best thing then if i want a FOB that is depenend on certain factors, but dont want an airbase? next to beggin baha to add those propertires to respawn points
There are no other options. Players can rearm at airbases, carriers/cruisers and rearm points. I guess the carriers/cruisers are your next best option
You can spawn something else on the fob to physically block it, such as a tent or a bunker.

also is it a known bug that it wont allow me to change the images on my campaigns and missions?
But what about the AH-94?
hm

But what about the AH-94?
hm
vote to select whether or not i add 2 helicopters to the units to use list

anyone know why it wont let me save after adding an image to my campaign?
image has to be 1mb or less in size
yeah thats not it

also how does chance work? does it just output true if it succeeds
yes
I'm creating a multi-player mission for AV-42s, is there a reason why I wouldn't be able to select infantry for a pick-up objective?

Bug, restart the editor (or game, I don't remember exactly)
rgr, I'll work on that later. I'll do other entities now, have a lot to populate

Can I find an example of how to get the logs somewhere?
in your vtol vr root there is a shortcut to player.log
Ight thank you

Try setting the image again?
no longer allows me to save the image
You might need to restart your game again, but can you post a new player.log?

What region did you say the server was in? If possible id recommend looking at moving the server to Europe or America, I wouldn't be suprised if some of the issues you've had are due to region specific issues in a less-popular area
The server provider is based in Greece, though I've seen it connect from Finland as well
It wasn't just my bot that was having issues, everyone in the discord developer servers was freaking out

i have done my best to accomedate the stupidity of ground units by giving them a very nice and detailed path in the center of a road to follow, and yet half of the vehicles get stuck when trying to get into the colloum formation (wich i already placed them in), and the other half drives along the edge of the road at a 45° angle. what else am i supposed to do?
Don't put them in a group and just have them individually follow the path.
ah yes. 20 actions for objective complete trigger

also, how to not have the carrier formation fuck up upon mission start? for some reason it always wants a cruiser to be the lead ship. looks shit if the player is taking off and sees all the ships clusterfucking each other for the lead spot
The formation is based on the order in which you add them to the group. Lead, then rear left, then rear right, continuing left right left right
So remove them all from the group and add them back in that order

i assume same with vehicles?
Probably? Never used vehicle formations myself
where do I get VTEdit?

It has a name?

Dyn Lib uses 99% default actions. @Green can you post a pic of the unit's properties window? Also, use Path , not Railpath
How much of DynLib has land unit groups moving in formation?
If they are starting and moving in a line like that, they don't need formation.

Unless you want them to stop and re-form when a unit dies

How are they moving instead? Screenshot would be excellent
alright, give me a moment
@Skumby they move like this, clipping through buildings

Doesn't column form them up in 2 columns?
I don’t think so, but there’s plenty of options there! One for every occasion
its fixed!

Is anyone trying to make a mission similar to the one in topgun 2?
I’m amazed there’s not 30 already
movie not been out long enough yet

is there a way to assign a multiplayer spawn to a carrier slot with the Move Spawn event?
No
damn

Alright... So who's making the top gun mission recreation?
uhhh
C talked me into the thought 2 hours ago

does the airbase start out as enemy? otherwise i doubt the bombers will be able to taxi
save, close and restart the editor
itsa know bug. after that, they should show up

what are you using to tell the bombers to take off? events, objectives? trigger?
triggers
conditional

is their path free? arethey placed weirdly?
they're placed like this
can i see the units page of the bombers?

can i see the units page of the bombers?
i think bombers are too large for the tents.
i might be wrong, but if the ai does not think it hasenough space, it wont taxi. try placing them somewhere else

but how do I make it trigger if they detect a plane?
like this?
By team enemy

What do you wish to do when the RADAR sees them?
Need to break the debug up into two parts
Stick a System -> Tutorial Message in that event's actions too

but how do I set up the logic??? what cinditions do I use?
With your current conditions you have
add 2 events that fire both when the RADARs detect and when the bombers take-off

how do I do that system tutorial message?
like this?
yes

and will the message be displayed to both players?
or only 1?
to all players

both types of infantry are allowed right?
Ye
nice

how many infantry can be carried?
8
oooh

Is it possible to make a resuply point spawn when infantry enters an area?
I cant make it start despawned
No

oh  what about if I switch the airfields team? will we be able to resuply on the airfield then?
Yes, at the usual locations
The pads and the hangars

whats the range on rocket artillery?
And does in increse if theyre high up?
very far

And does in increse if theyre high up?
very far
there isnt really a number

how do I get them to target an aproaching ship?
If they see it they will target it
You can set the ship as a priority target via events

can they use an AWACS radar tp target?
Although Im not sure how good rocket arty is against carriers
no

what about the other kind of artillery?
RADARs can datalink with planes, so can ships im pretty sure
I thought the artillery had to use waypoints to fire?

I thought the artillery had to use waypoints to fire?
ould these truck see those ships?
It can

You can use waypoints or visual

Is the ship moving or standing still?
oh, how do I set up the waypoints then?
moving

oh, how do I set up the waypoints then?
moving
ah

want the awacs to give radio comms? use their actual va
no
didn't aruchanal incident use you

ok how do I get Aty to fire on a waypoint?
and its inacurate, right?
Use an event

@hidearimjosh So Carrier Command 2?
Or that spaceship one
Damn it's already a thing?

Damn it's already a thing?
😔
I mean the vr in the game is an afterthought, so its not very good, I get easily dizzy. And I've never been dizzy playing vtol vr (+200 hours)

How do I set another wave of enemies to spawn after the immediate spawn wave is splashed? Would it be through events?
Yup. A triggered event
gotcha thank you

applies even if they're single-unit waves?
oh if it's only a single unit then yeah doesn't matter
gotcha

ah ok, so even if 'start immediately' is ticked, the parameter will still need to be met for it to actually trigger?
yes, the conditions must always be met to advance the sequence
alright sick, thanks again

Is there a condition you can specify that AI will not fire at you until X time has passed?  It'd be nice to create a 1v1 guns mission where they don't shoot on the merge
You can set them to not engage, but then they won't manoeuvre to engage you either
Then use a timed event to turn them back to engage later

Could you set a path?
Always
example, hot spawn your craft about 20 seconds from the merge

Is there a way to have aircraft automatically take off and engage ships detected by an AWACs?
you can order them to take off
and set a default waypoint on the spawn to go to the ships

if I set a path for bombers that passes close too the ships, will they target them too?
should

When it come to a MP mission, semi-milsim, what kind of distance are AH-94 pilots find acceptable flying to get to a target? Potentially, flying in that time in a low-threat environment
No more than 25nm
i paid for a 200 mile combat radius im gonna use the combat radius!

AH-94 air to air rearming when?
When you make this

Hello, this is my first mission/map so bear with me. I have found that it takes ages to load (sometimes more than 30 min). Some kind map designers (don't remember names, just I know one made dynamic liberation) told me it could be an issue with cities taking up too much CPU space on loading. I want to take this project seriously and am open to any and all suggestions. Here is the Steam Community page for the mission: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2815386580 Edit: since the linked file was uploaded, I have reduced the size of the cities and removed irrelevant ones, which helped load times.
Canada finally gets what it deserves
*The US of course*

if you make a mission in Public Testing, will it just become unavailable in later versions?
Any time that question is asked people say "yes", but in my experience no. I've even played 1.4.4 missions that use the new MAD-4 missile in 1.4.3 just fine.
Oh, I assume you mean "earlier versions"

like, if I were to make a mission with the PT editor, would that not be transferrable to the main game once v1.4.4 comes out on the main branch?
Oh, that will definitely work

What place would be more appropriate for speculation about/wishlist for future misison editor assets?
I'd do it in #vtolvr_chat
#vtolvrdev too, I guess. Suggestions are in there

Is there a way to change the side on which a given unit it? E.g. have the allied use MPA-155?
Not currently.
team a when no MAD 4 or ESuperMissile

Is there a way to change a base from red to blue in the mission editor?
yeah just select it in "bases" and change the team from enemy to allied
Yes, but can this be changed while the mission is running?

Yes, but can this be changed while the mission is running?
yeah u can
Thanks, I'll have to check this out.

Is it possible to have/do global variable persist between missions in a campaign?
No
I hope we can get that one day, that would make more dynamic campaign possible

hey where do i make a map multiplayer? I looked at what other ppl where saying answering this question before but I don't see the checkbox
The map itself is separate from missions you make with it
When making a campaign, there is a checkbox to make it mp-only

ohh u have to make it a campaign?
Yes, unfortunately standalone missions are not supported yet
That being said, you can just make a campaign of 1 mission

other question is there a team b based tanker?
no but both teams are able to refuel from it i think
Is anyone else having issues with the conditional editor either not selecting nodes or changing everything with conditional to the same thing?

Is anyone else having issues with the conditional editor either not selecting nodes or changing everything with conditional to the same thing?
Hopefully he'll fix it soon. In the meantime, you can make the actual objective type something impossible ("land" with no waypoint set should work) then use conditional events to complete the objectives.
It can probably also be fixed directly in the .vts file but I don't recommend trying that until you get pretty familiar with the rest of the editor.

N00b question: how do you make a limited respawn MP mission?
you can check mpdeath or mpspawn get killed to increment global var
At that’s what it is for. Thanks

but how do you prevent it from respawning?
put them in jail
... or is it just decrease a variable and fail all objectives once that number reach 0

do I have to restart the game or something?
I’d like to see a built in way to set the numbers of available aircraft and the numbers of available weapons for a whole campaign
The number of respawns/tickets available is doable with the in-game logic already

But does anyone know how to fix this?
Did you try quitting and reopening the campaign? The error states the campaign name and description are invalid.
But they look fine on the left.

Did you try quitting and reopening the campaign? The error states the campaign name and description are invalid.
But they look fine on the left.
Yes, definitely a kludge though. But no way to limit weapons quantities

is it possible to limit the weapons that can be equipped at the start of a mission (for a given flight), then allow more options once the flight has landed?
No
Maybe

Yo, got a boatload of questions being that I started making maps and using mods since legit 2 days ago. Would I be able to get some help?
Yup
OK good looks, lemme just write this all out gimme like 2 mins

OKay deff found help with what I watned, but still have some questions. First off, will wingmen actually speak to the player in a playtest, being that they haven't at all even when set to player commands. Second, I want to basically hand-hold the player into taking control of a squadron upon takeoff by using the PTT comms feature, but I can't seem to get the tutorial messages to fire in order just like the in-game tutorial. Do I have to seperate each of the messages into different events and then make them fire each other after time delays? Thirdly, the (System - Play BGM) feature just doesn't seem to work. I hit the test button and nothing happens, and of course in playtest nothing happens. I know it's a playable audio bc I have it as a custom MP3 in my planes themselves.
Yes, yes, yes
VTOL VR is fussy about the MP3 files it accepts

yea see I have three unit groups, each of them for each player that spawns in one of those three squads. upon takeoff I'm trying to have the game tell them (With a radio message) that they are commanding that squad, to which the tutorial messages goes over the thumbstick and says "Use PTT to command ___ squad" and then a quote on the cockpit windshield says "Wingmen, form up." However, I'm getting the radio message and the "form up" message, which is making me think all three messages are indeed firing, but only the last one is being displayed. So would I just have the first message fire, wait x amount of seconds, then have a separate event fire the next message after that amount of time?
Also, the wingmen aren't speaking, dk why but
Ah. Wingmen don't work in MP

I though Baha sorted that before weekending off into the sunset?
he did?
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/982462784660975656

Can someone advise how I make a respawn loop?  I've got a trigger condition of "unit is not alive", and set the unit.  Next I want the new unit to spawn in the same place, but it isn't doing it at all? Does it spawn in a random place? I say this because the map is....quite large.
Units can only spawn once. Events can only fire once
Ok, so I have to just keep adding units and triggers?

Ok, so I have to just keep adding units and triggers?
Yup
Ok cool, thanks @Skumby ☺️

how do I allow all Vehicles to be used by the player?
You can't
damn

I get that not every building can be destructible, but a couple infrastructure targets would be interesting. Maybe: power plant (lights in city go dark?),  Enemy hideout (small simple building), radio/communications node.   Add a couple civilian vehicle types and the possibilities would go up a lot.
A very good way around it right now is creative interpretation
Plop down a few farm buildings for a water treatment plant, shove a bunker where the control room or something explosive like a flocculation building would be

Can ANY building besides a bunker be destroyed?
tents, bunkers, oil rigs (the feet, the tower and another part I forgot)
Gotcha.  Thank you

how do i make a mission multiplayer compatible? i have set up 2 bases but i can only add one player spawn in 1 team
Make it a campaign
standalone missions cannot be multiplayer

anyone know the "ripple rate" for the MPA-155?
The amount of missiles fired per ripple (or burst)
yeah but how much time in between ripple? The wiki talks about it being the amount of time in seconds between salvoes

yeah but how much time in between ripple? The wiki talks about it being the amount of time in seconds between salvoes
like..... 10 milliseconds? lol
ugh, thanks

a few seconds? I think
Ok, I’ll go with that assumption. I wish this was configurable

Is it possible for a allied infantry unity to board a multiplayer's AV-42C? When I select the "board aircraft" action, it doesn't show any possible target ...
You need to use Pick Up objectives to get infantry to board player craft
ah ... okay. Thanks @Skumby

"AnyEnemy" as proximity trigger only count actual units, right? Not missile and such?
Correct
Not sure if the drone cruiser's drones count, but who's ever going to find out?

Mind posting your player log? There might be an error in there that explains why

Mind posting your player log? There might be an error in there that explains why
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Is there a way to have surface to air radars turned off until an event happens?
yes, uncheck the "Engage enemies" box. you can have an event that will set them to engage enemies and they will turn on radar and then start looking for things to shoot
Quick thing ya'll: I have an allied fleet consisting of an aircraft carrier, assault carrier, and a few cruisers. All of them are set to different paths like in the adivce I gave bro above^^ However, for some reason my rightmost carrier just decided to put on Deja Vu and always consists on drifting into the whole fleet like he went AWOL. he's set to a default of navving a path but doesn't want to, and I even traded him out for a regular carrier thinking it was the ship type that was bugged. Could it be that he's only carrying F45s and there's some random behavior idk ab these ships?

oh hadn't spotted that yet, thank

Honestly is there anything they did not do to the 130? It's a troop and cargo transport, gunship, apparently carrier capable and now they strap rockets on it. Why not just retire every other airframe and just use this plane as your alrounder
Also sorry but no lol  Check out the NotBDarmory mod though, it actually let's you rocket boosters to your aircraft.
Also can drop cruise missiles

Does the SAAW not engage munition threats like HARM’s?
I can’t seem to get it to engage incoming missiles
SAAW is a fairly low tech/small unit, it’s radar is likely incapable of intercepting missiles

If missile intercepting is needed, dosnt AAA do that job better?
It’s static though
Does the enemy get a AAA truck? I thought it was only the allies that had it

Does the enemy get a AAA truck? I thought it was only the allies that had it
If you need mobile, MAD4 works
Well can’t shoot and move at the same time

Is the missile controlled by the radar unit? because would adding more radars solve the limited engagements
More radars would fix yeah
You’d need more launchers tho, iirc a launcher can only have one radar

How would I configure it to prioritize missiles?
Yeah one TEL can only engage a single target at a time
One TEL to one radar does allow multiple missiles to a target but I’ve yet to figure out how to designate one to target missiles because they only seem to target my aircraft

Hi all! Just started learning how to do mission today cause i just love this game and always thought it could be so much more with a scenario i have in mind since launch , but that i've never find online yet. So i just raised up me sleeve and dive right in, and i must say.... god! didnt thought it was a tool so well made, simple and yet so powerfull!!! But i got some question for the veteran mission builder. Is there a place somewhere in the editor where i can use static objet (like dock, house or scenario thing) to use in some event?
yea! 😛
What do you mean "use in some event"?

What do you mean "use in some event"?
You can place different types of static options either in the map or in the mission.
like if a unit is near a dock for x time, start a event

didnt remember but... is the scenary object destructable?
Only the oil rig
another one ... is new unit in the game moddable? like introducing a new type of building or such?

another one ... is new unit in the game moddable? like introducing a new type of building or such?
With mods, yes. https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/7ekcqp7f/
But that means someone will need to be running this mod to play your mission.

so cannot upload to the workshop "fire and forget" without telling to player to download the package i presume?
Do I have any means of duplicating a mission so I can make 2 slightly different versions of it?

Anyone know what a negative kill score means for a player in a multi-player game? (e.g. -40)
teamkills
although I've seen it glitched, once I got something like -70 even though the infantry I was shooting at was definitely the enemy

couple question for you guy.... 1-Is it possible to offer the possibility (in sp mission) to the player, to choose his plane at mission start? if so, how? 2- In a campaign , can we use some data of the previous mission in the next (like global number variable or X plane left in the previous mission) to include in the start of the new one? 3- i know its a dumb question but.... how i im supposed to put a player spawn point? didnt find the info anywhere! :\
No, no, it's in the player category
ok thanks!

will an unspawned unit still count as "near waypoint" if they are within the zone but not yet spawned?
No
thanks

Is it possible to set up a final condition to make everyone land to end mission not just one player? every thing I try doesn't work
just one
That's a shame, it always annoys me when people leave without landing.

Does this work ? or it only trigger for one player?
I've tried that with all airborne for a take off and it didn't work. I think it needs all of them even if they aren't spawn in
Yeah :/ then its a bug

how do i get a drone carrier to launch it's drones?
Events
I've seen it before in some missions but the ability to spot something on tads and it will trigger an event, how is that done?

mission editing is rough... especially since I want so much to have voice lines...

q: how do i make mobile artilery shoot a unit group?
You can only make them arty waypoints, I believe
okay thx

... if I try to upload to steam, it says "map must be packed" ...?
have you edited the map?
No, but now it looks like the whole map is gone ... WTF?

No, but now it looks like the whole map is gone ... WTF?
so you cant access this button in the mission editor.

Problem is that I can't get into the editor with that scenario, but I guess I can do it with another scneario

was the directory named differently?
No, it was the same. I don't know why deleting some mission within the campaign also deleted the map ... possibly a bug
weird.

Any mission editors know how to set up protect objectives on a group of ships?
I have the ships in a sea group already
but the protect obj seems to be one unit only?

but the protect obj seems to be one unit only?
I'd use a conditional objective instead
can you leave the success field empty?

can you leave the success field empty?
ah looks like you can
thanks

will any of the enemy AI planes attack friendly ships?
the bombers and the UAVs don't seem to want to do it
Yes, if you give them air-to-ground weapons. Rockets or bombs.

How do you give an attack order?
You can add them as designated targets
They are automatically revealed to the AI and they will immediately go toward it and attack it, stopping at nothing

is that done by setting the objective for team b and then designating each of the targets?
You use events. There are actions for each unit to "set priority target" and "set designed target" IIRC
ah fantastic, thanks

First timer here, how does setting up PVP missions work? I got the campaign and map and everything, but the enemy team can't use the friendly team's units including the playable vehicles, so how would I set up spawns for both teams?
Ah, I see the player tab now
What's the max amount of players one scenario can have?

What's the max amount of players one scenario can have?
16
Do I need to do anything specific objective wise for a simple team deathmatch mission

How would one do that?
Uhhhh good question, I haven't used the pvp features of the editor
😅

do the bombers ever attack more than 1 target? Or do they blow their wad on one and then dip?
nope
they have either 4 x 32  or 4x16 bombs by default i think

Have you ever repacked a map in the scenario editor?
@Warbuc06 ^
yes

How did you repack it when you weren't able to load the map in the editor?
the stuff in the top left corner was still interactable
in my screenshot you can see that the tabs are still there

The mission(s) you deleted - were they the only ones using that map?
yes
all of them used the same map

So your campaign had a load of missions that used one map, and some other missions that used other maps?
i only had one other mission in the campaign and it used the same map it was also the first in the campaign order when i deleted it

Ok, so when I create a scenario with that map, I get extra bits in my map folder that you don't have

so i need to replace them?
Still checking - I really want to make this break
alr

Nope. Can't. Steam workshop download is in `Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\667970\1725346568` . What do you see in that directory?
Is what the map directory in my campaign looks like
So you need to copy `height.pngb` to the map directory in your campaign directory

And maybe you'll be sorted then?
ill try it
so i went to the file to copy height.pngb but now even more is missing

maybe i should replace the entire file?
Sure, but the `WorkshopItemInfo.xml` isn't necessary/might be harmful
ok

@Frenchy Does the above look anything at all like the problem you encountered?
made a new mission in the campaign, attempted to edit ScenarioTest#1.5 and encountered the same issue
it said it had to repair the mission order again

how do i send the entire campaign file?
it says the file type is not supported
You'd put it in a zip file, but don't worry about that until Baha says he wants it

Can you post a log file next time you add a scenario? That's clearly where it's breaking, and I've only seen a log file from when you tried to load the scenario afterwards so far
here you go
i added a third scenario after having no issues with the other two

What's in the campaign map directory? The log's complaining about a missing file again
Yup, it's gone again 😄
why did it load normally this time then

Im curious, would you have those files in a normal scenario too?
The map is inside the scenario directory, rather than the campaign directory, for single scenarios
this is also following my camera in the editor

but you are working in a campaign, right?
The bug is happening in a campaign, yes
can you post your vtm/vts/vtc files? IIrc this has something to do with a weird ID/name miss match

can you post your vtm/vts/vtc files? IIrc this has something to do with a weird ID/name miss match
By normal, do you mean single player?
is this what you are talking about?

By normal, do you mean single player?
is this what you are talking about?
I  had issue with .ogg file being present in a scenario and also a separated  campaign scenario,  failing to play.  Like if the game is indexing everything then use the file, Where ever they are. (removing the single scenario, fixed it in the campaign)

thats one of the files, there should be a few others, specifically a `.vts` file

Sure. Would you find that helpful? It's just a binary mess for me
this is what i have
I can decrypt it if needed

so i just need to change the name to Korengal and it should work?
I would try changing the folder name to just `Korengal` and updating the map IDs to `Korengal`
You said this was a workshop map right?

You said this was a workshop map right?
yes
Has anyone confirmed workshop maps actually *work*? I wouldn't be suprised if the game tries to append the workshop ID to the map ID but isn't correctly updating the internally listed id

Has anyone confirmed workshop maps actually *work*? I wouldn't be suprised if the game tries to append the workshop ID to the map ID but isn't correctly updating the internally listed id
I created two scenarios in a multiplayer campaign using the Korengal map, and it didn't break
Well then I have no idea, the other possibly weird thing is `ScenarioTest1.5` has the ID `ScenarioTest#1.5`

Dunno if that is breaking it?
bruh
all this trouble over a # sign

If i set an alternate spawn weight to 1 will it never happen randomly?
or if it does how do i change player spawn mid-mission
It will have a 1% chance of being used.

i downloaded the map as a free flight, will that be editable in the editor?
or does it need to be a certain file
Sorry?

is there a way to make units fire at something even if they dont have line of sight?
If they're artillery, yes
Otherwise, no

how hard is it to make a 1v1 thing?
Should be pretty easy
i have 0 experience with doing this

ok great, how much stuff would i have to do?
Depends how fancy you want to get
sorry for being a pest, just want 2 planes, any weapons

can i add the other planes from the wiki like the ASF-58?
Yes
And the simple 1v1 mission creep begins 😛

Hey ya’ll. has anybody gotten screwed over for using copyright music in the mission editor? Wanted to add a track but really dnt feel like getting sent to the shadow realm over it
No one has gotten in trouble for it, I believe its *technically* reportable via steam but steam will just take the workshop item down
That would be if someone reports it tho right

One more question: Is it possible for the MP test to actually be played in MP? Like can I get a freind of mine to play the test with me to make sure his side of the story carries out correctly and for balancing reasons? Or is it only solo playtesting
Reason being I do want to try to make a MultiCrew Mod mission, but that involves testing it with MultiCrew actually being used
Just upload it to steam, make the picture something like "**DO NOT USE: WIP**" and boom ur good

"involves testing it with MultiCrew" have we ever played the Desert Door Gunners?
yeah
i don't know if it works

Is there a way in the editor to make, on a "OnEnter" enemy proximity waypoint do an Action on all vehicule who enter it, instead of a specific single unit??
I try to make the enemy, when they reach X waypoint, to move to another waypoint randomly.... but the way i see it in the editor, it look like i have to manually program each single unit in the conditionnal trigger type for it to work, and nowhere it seem like a "batch" unit to choose from
Nope. Events can only fire once

Is there a way to force players to not be able to go above a certain height?
yes
I have no idea how

is there a way to make multiple possible RTB areas? I have 2 cruisers that are potential RTB's each of them field a different MP vehicle.
I would preffer if there was a way to tell each person to go back to their own cruiser.
much thanks, I'll see if my current iteration for it works. I want it to be an or so whoever makes it back first finishes it.

how do you take a conditional objective that if failed is mission failure but there's not really a completion criteria to complete on actual mission success?
You can just not have any logic for the completion
but then the mission will not complete porperly or am i missing something?

but then the mission will not complete porperly or am i missing something?
it is several targets that cannot be destroyed the entirety of the mission or its mission failure.
truing to figure out how to get it clear at the end or just only count as critical if destroyed.

thats full out coding isn't it?
not exactly
Just mildly advanced scripting lol

is there another workaround for it?
It doesn't have to be that complex. If it's as simple as "don't let this happen", then once you complete the final objective in the mission, just set it to complete this objective
e.g. Objective 1, don't let your carrier sink -> fails if your carrier is destroyed Objective 5 (final), destroy the enemy HQ's bunker -> on completion, set objective 1 to succeed

do I use the actual name you put on the objectives?
Obj 1 = don't destroy X target, begins on start Obj 2 = go to waypoint, begins on start Obj 3 = blow up thing, begins on completion of Obj 2 Obj 4 = RTB, begins on completion of Obj 3, on completion it completes Obj 1
all the other objectives work fine, I just need an objective to lear with the last one of the mission.

I forget where it is in the actions menu, I think it might be under system?
just as an event?
But there's an action to complete an objective and it just has you select from the list of all objectives in your mission

how exactly do the Entry and Exit Conditions work for Event Sequences?
You can have it so that when they are detected they die
thats what it is, when they are seen on tads they are killed

I'm trying to remember if I've played that one, is it the one with the convoys stopped on the road?
It has a city of patrolling "allied" units, and you have to spot which ones are secretly the enemy based on their unit types and formation.
Then blow up only those units.

Someone know how i can do a random waypoint? Ive tryed a couple thing but nothing work! What i mean is "if vehicule X arrived at waypoint Y, then it have a 50% chance to go to waypoint A or B"
I don't even think the guy that died died from a missle or gun he crashed I'm pretty sure.
The waypoint's location can't be random, but you can use a Conditional Action and the Chance condition to make a 50/50 chance of telling that unit which waypoint to move to.

you got something you need to say, dragon boi?
:whatChuJustSaid:
yea! now i see! i made exacly what you showed.... but instead i was adding another ELSE IF for the other waypoint!

so for the else i cannot put another 50%? what if a put another loop of the same action?
You technically can, but the actual probabilities are deceptive.
and does the event only happen once or it alway happen if the unit is near the waypoint again?

and does the event only happen once or it alway happen if the unit is near the waypoint again?
Events can only trigger once
really??? fuck! 😦

is it possible to get AI units to jettison their own fuel tanks?
i had to make hundred of event if i want a truly dynamic mission.... a
Not that I can see

Any one knows exactly why negative score happens? I though it was maybe because the players were accidentally destroying allied forces, but I made all allied not able to receive friendly damage and I'm still seeing negative score. Is it because enemy forces are destroying some of the allied forces?
iirc there's a bug where if the host starts a new mission then kills from the first mission get carried over to the next as negative
wouldnt be surprised if it has something to do with switching teams on the next mission

are you restarting the mission at all?
or do the negative scores appear in the middle of the first play through?
no restarting

or do the negative scores appear in the middle of the first play through?
no restarting
ah interesting

Hey guys, what does the "follow function actually for land vehicles? Do I have to designate a target to follow?
Jesus I cant type... I meant to say "What does the 'follow' function actually do for land vehicles?"
I’ve played with it a bit, and have never worked it out

Are there any shared missions that people use as templates? Or that they're willing to share?
Like, your mission got bugged and can't load anymore? Can you PM me the mission files?
like a github?

I think @AtrociousAmbition/Mr. Charisma was working on something like that.

@BurntPineapple is there something you're confused how to do? If you have an idea for a mission you want to make, I can walk you through how to achieve it.
Why does my pick up objective get skipped and the mission completes before I pick up anyone?
Is that objective not set to "Required"?

yes

Does the objective have a "minimum required" slider on the right?

Oh wait It might be because I had it's start mode as triggered instead of prereq
yeah that was it

better for the community no?
ah, yes
nobody is making money here, weird to gate our content

ask the dev? hes literally here in this chat speaking to you
Oh my god it’s the same argument as earlier. Remove control from a creator just because some other people want it to be different :agony:
this man embodies the spirit of open source

How do I make an objective to fly along a path?
You can set a series of waypoints to be followed
and turn on the setting to automatically cycle them

anyone know why my sound files and music files work when i launch from the editor but when I launch my mission from the downloaded multiplayer campaign from the workshop they dont trigger? everything else in the mission works fine

Why is Mobius in B7R? 🤨
It looks like some of the audio files are duplicated in two places for some reason. 1. `\The Round Table\b7r\` 2. `\The Round Table\Example\radioMessages\b7r\`
yeah i think its from before I moved it... might delete the current workshp version and reupload it fresh or smth

are the audio files supposed to also be in CustomScenarios? it won't let me choose from any files other than in EditorResources for the audio files
I assumed they would be copied there, but maybe not. I haven't worked with them in a while.
If they only reside in EditorResources, then yeah try removing the mission from the workshop and re-adding it. Might also want to try re-selecting each audio file in your mission triggers as well.

Do you have that MP mission as a single scenario too?
I’m trying to think of some fun missions to make… anyone have any suggestions?
hmmm i will check but it also isnt playing the background music. checked my voice, bgm, and in game music volume, didnt think about the radio volume

I’m trying to think of some fun missions to make… anyone have any suggestions?

it is an mp scenario in an mp campaign. i copied the audio files from the editorresourcesfolder to the customscenarios folder for the mission too and didnt seem to do anything

is maybe one of these an issue?
these are the 3 places where my audio folder is currently residing for the mission
but i dont have any SP missions with that audio data, its only in these 3 folders

i was gonna use someone else but it never sounded good, glados was the best sounding voice that wasnt a pony?
how many troops can the AV carry?
8

also does all landed only count for occupied units? for mp for example, if only 2 out of 4 people are in a craft, will it need all 4 landed to complete?
thank you
is there anyway to test a MP mission withought uploading it?

and less lag?
Yay I might be able to run that at more than 10 fps

do you know what is causing the lag in the map currently?
mostly the unit counts
is there any golden ratios that get thrown around in terms of how many AI units you can spawn before you start to lag?

it really depends on the hardware, but also the types of units

fighters cause far more cpu use than tanks

@BahamutoD do you have any insight as to what is the biggest resource hog in missions?
ah yes, the 12:40am dev ping
If Baha added some way for the mission triggers to tell the engine "these units won't be used, please permanently delete/unload them from RAM" then I would use it.

somebody has to have tested unit counts before no?

it does somewhat, but not much

how many units does that one have?
There I formatted it a bit more reasonably
oh, my dumbass, thank you

how many units is your new faster map?
on Easy, about 15-20% of the units spawn in
still the same because in that mode you will randomly start outside sector A, B, or C. You just have to clear that one sector to complete the mission.

i7-11700 base clock is 2.5Ghz and boost clock is 4.9Ghz. Where are you getting 3.6 from?

Anybody have any insight to why radio messages only play for the host in a multi-player steam mission, and not anyone else?
How do i make a actual made take off objective in the multiplayer campaign mission im making i dont know how
Not sure what you mean

Can you take a screenshot or two?
I will tmrw im off now
unfortunately no, it check all MP spawn also when not present

Hey folks, I was wondering if there is a good way to display text to all players in a MP lobby when an event triggers. I've been trying to use the tutorial message action but the text only appears on the Host's screen. Is what I want to do possible?
That's an excellent question, I believe text used to display on all screens.
I recommend you report that as a bug in #public_testing or #vtolvrdev

I also tried using a team radio message - which only plays for the host. Is that unusual as well?
I've only used the messages for all players, but that sounds unusual yes
Just to verify. I'm using the System -> Tutorial -> Display Message. Is this what you are also talking about?

Just to verify. I'm using the System -> Tutorial -> Display Message. Is this what you are also talking about?
Yes
That *should* go to all players

alright this may sound a bit odd but how do i update a map?
i've added a few things to my campaign mission but im not entirely sure if it has already updated the map to the workshop
How do I make a takeoff objective for molutplayer campaign

wont that just dupe it?
What sort of takeoff objective did you have in mind
No, it'll update it

For one plane, or some planes, or all planes?
sweet
all planes

So maybe not so much removing the randomness, but making it only one or two cities long?
Yeah, and I just showed you the condition tree to achieve that.
Yes, this is already planned. A version where you only have to complete a single sector.

can anyone help me with chance events? if I want 1 of 5 events to trigger after a unit is destroyed do you set up 5 chance triggers all set to 20% and set them to all trigger on unit death?
Nope, because then you might get more than one of them firing
You want to use conditional actions

ok and how do i make it so you can choose between them in briefing???
You can't
yeah you can

You're doing a multiplayer scenario?
i want to make one yeah
You need to create a multiplayer campaign, then create a scenario inside that

whats the unit of radius ?
Metres
Everything is metres

what does the hull number mean on the ships?
it's its designation set by the mission maker
is the number is 69 or 420 it means that the ship is based otherwise it's just a number

how to set MP player spawn on a carrier?
in the carrier's settings
you can add vehicles to spawn on it in there

only gives me the option of none. is there something i need to do first?
yeah spawn the vehicle/spawn in first
anyone have a tutorial on mission triggers and setting up a custom mission or can help me with it?

can i force an alt spawn and spawn in the same unit at the same time and have the unit spawn at the alt spawn?

Uhhhh, can you reword the question?
basically i want to force a unit to spawn at an alt spawn

Uhhhh, can you reword the question?
basically i want to force a unit to spawn at an alt spawn
so can i spawn in the unit *and* force the unit to have that alt spawn at the same time?

so can i spawn in the unit *and* force the unit to have that alt spawn at the same time?
Yeah, that should work as long as the set alt-spawn action is above the spawn action. Although I haven't tested it.
ok thanks

how do i get the desert camo jets on a mission?
Join team B
i think desert camo skins are bugged

Hey, im new- can anybody tell me how I trigger the 'successful end' of a mission? I have a handful of objectives, and I want my last obj to be to RTB... but then I want the mission to end once the players are on the ground within the radius of the base, alive and stationary.
im happy to hop in a voice channel for this too if that helps..
I don't have the editor in front of me, but there is an objective type of "land" that lets you set a destination waypoint, and an objective start type called "final" or something that makes it the final objective that only shows up after all others are completed.

far as trying to sort of play-test a bit, is the only option for MP to just put it up on workshop and link it to buddies as-is? this game doesn't support like, host can host and the joiners will DL the content... right? (unsure if that makes sense...)
Once you've uploaded it to the workshop, you can open the workshop page for it in steam and change it to "Unlisted". Then the only effective way for others to get it is to have them join your lobby.
Just note that every time you update the mission it will revert back to Public. Which is something I've been meaning to mention to @BahamutoD

but so if i just make it 'unlisted' then whoever joins my private MP lobby will automatically download what they need to play my mission if I'm hosting it?
yep
wicked

@Sypwn you know of any links that could show me how to use global values? i feel like i need them... trying to make an obj where players merely detect a certain number of a total number of enemy stuff...
or trigger... doesn't really matter... just trying to figure out how to do something like that in the conditional logic screen
ex: there are 5 radar stations and 3 SAMs. i want to make a scouting objective 'complete' after the player (or allied AI) detects like 6 things out of 8

ok, so that's how you can use global value? you can just like, tick it up one for every 'true' conditional completion that happens?
im trying to imagine like an 'and-or
i would fire 8 conditional actions upon objective start up

for proximity trigger events in multiplayer missions, does the *Player* option in the *Triggered By* setting respond to just *any* player entering the waypoint radius?
I imagine so
a lot of mission editor stuff is still unoptimized for multiplayer mission making

@Sypwn or anybody else- i might have asked this before... but when pathing ground units such as trucks/tanks, do they sort of automatically prefer to stick to roads if it's loosely the path, or do I need to get VERY precise with my paths?   also, anybody know how the behavior setting 'StayInRadius' works?
There is NO snapping to roads. Your tanks will stick to the path you make...usually.
F

when i make a waypoint, is there a way to cycle through waypoints that have been 'made visible' or whatever? like, can I set a bunch of pre-made waypoints that are points of interest that players would be able to toggle through that aren't related to objectives?
no, outside of the refueling and RTB waypoints
ok, so basically only bases will have waypoints... well, and objectives that you've associated a waypoint with (whether static or a given unit)

does anyone know why I get this error when I clearly have spawnpoints? all the 45's and f16's are MP Spawns
Tastes like mods to me
no mods

Where are the F-16s coming from?
hopeful wishing that the F-26Bs could be F-16s one day

Did you convert the scenario into a multiplayer one, or has it been multiplayer from the start?
It's been multiplayer from the start
all I've made is campaigns

If you feel comfortable with it, can you zip up your multiplayer campaign and PM it to me? I wanna take it apart
sure, if you want to "steal" it go ahead because I did literally nothing but add the spawns into the map lol
how would I go about zipping up a mission tho?

how would I go about zipping up a mission tho?

Are you getting that error when you try to upload it to the workshop, or when you try to test it?
upload to workshop
but, so I went into the scenario info and set the auto player count back to being enabled and now it seems it wants to let me upload

if I set it to auto balance, does it make it so for every 1 person on blue team, 1 has to be on red?
No. It adds a player slot for each MP spawn, as far as it can
Either you need to have the box ticked, or you need to move the sliders/enter numbers

also, can you tell me what "Hull Number" is for the ships?
It's the giant number painted on the deck and tower
It appears in the comm menu unless you give them a name

@Sypwn figured out the issue with obj completion we had the other night for the last obj- the global value wasn't specified for like, 4/6 of the enemy  targets, so they weren't incrementing it up high enough to complete.   also, is there a way to hide all the HUD when in the editor to take clean screenshots?
iirc there is a camera tool you can use when testing the scenario, i *think* its insert or something to access it but idr
so i just have to launch the mission and actually be in game. balls

Why would they pick up troops?
How would they know which troops to pick up, and where to take them?
Alright

How would they know which troops to pick up, and where to take them?
Alright
I don’t know

what directory is that in? im seeing one in the main top level folder... but it hasn't been updated since like 2 months agoi
nvm found the current version
just getting stuck at 100% load bar.

Could you start the game, try to launch the mission, then quit once it gets stuck and post that log? It’s not close to me which of the errors in that log is the one that’s tripping you up
@Skumby here's what i got
Though it’s super weird that it seems to be going back to the start-up carrier bridge view afterwards

What map is the mission using? One of your own creation?
im trying to make a fly to objective and i noticed this radius properties right here. is there any way to visualize the size of it?
Can't remember if that's the one time you get a circle around it or not

I know it happens for one of them

@Skumby any thoughts as to why it would be trying to return to carrier? this is the second mission save that ive had this happen on. the first time, i thought it was maybe because of paths or triggers that conflicted with AI unit behavior settings or something... it's not the map being updated without being repacked. i know the map isn't inherently broken because I have 2 other missions that I have started on either side of this particular save that still both work.
More missions where Overlord is survival condition?
not in this one. but i did get my overlord survival condition one to work

Good. My work here is done
"Though it’s super weird that it seems to be going back to the start-up carrier bridge view afterwards"

Do you see that scene, or does it just stay on the loading screen until you murder it?
just stuck on loading. bar is 100%
If you want, I can take a look at it tomorrow. Zip up the mission folder and pm it to me.

hmm... anybody have any experience with AI bomber? trying to have it fly a path, then when close, trigger it to try to use the 'bomb waypoint' function. it gets within the waypoint trigger proximity, and then just kinda wigs out and flies off in some random direction while throttling up and down and S-curving until it eventually just crashes into the ground
Have you tried trying it to start it’s bombing earlier?
It might be trying to get into a position to start its run, but the start point is behind our inside it our something

Editor Question: Assault Carriers, what armaments do they have, and what does HULL NUMBER mean?
Hull number is just the number thats written on the boat, its got two ESSM launchers and one CIWS
Its possibly got two different radars, so it might be capable of using both launchers at the same time

Alternate spawn weight, if all left at 100. Game will RNG it?
Yup, they'll all have the same weight, the same equal chance of being picked
Any existing mods for more statics and units?

Any existing mods for more statics and units?
None that allow you to create missions to put on the workshop

So to make someone move you need event more that anything else, (with path and units ofc)   But how to make arty shoot waypoint? Cant find any event for it
And default waypoint do fug all
Ah i see. o was choosing unitgroup

why my mission dont start?

Yes

What exactly does the "StayInRadius" Behavior make ground units do?
for infantery it make them randomly run in a 64m radius
good for helo mission

How can I make a mission a multiplayer one?
been tryna learn how to use the editor
You cannot create standalone multiplayer missions, only multiplayer campaigns. Create a campaign and there is a check box to make it multiplayer.

Can I transfer an already existing mission to a campaign?
You can by editing the .vts file.
another thing I'm tryina upload to steam, but I get an error message saying that there's no player spawn But there is one and I can't add any more because there already is a player spawn bro what 🗿

? i have evrything done. just trying to rename it
campaign or mission?
If it's a mission I think you need to go in the editor itself, find the tab says scenario info and change the name

I really can't find anything to help sorry Can't you just switch it in the campaign menu?
On another note I'm having problems setting up spawn points in a MP campaign im tryna do I just get soft locked in the loading screen with the map What player spawn points should I add? I've already got a bunch of MP ones, but there's also the regular "player" spawn, which I thought was for SP only
another question (jesus this is complicated) I've got an error message "There are no player slots in the Scenario Info Window"
But nowhere in there can I chose the slots Where can I set them up?

That would be a bug if true. Are you on the public_testing branch?
Yup
Sure it's a bug? Cause when it was at 0 I couldn't spawn in and when it's at the maximum the player slots appear Isn't it what it does?

aaaah ok thanks

What is the range of the enemy MBT?
I'm playing a workshop mission in AH-94. The mission triggers an event once TADS locks to a particular (friendly) unit. I'm wondering how this is achieved. Haven't been in mission editor for a while but had a look just now and noticed a lot of new vehicle control conditionals that can be tested. But I can't see anything that behaves as above - fires when a unit is locked on by TADS. Anybody know how it is done?  Not mission editor I know, but does helicopter have a night vision setting?  I can't see a button on the dash for it!
Vehicle Controls conditions do not work in multiplayer. However, there is a condition to check if a player unit is locking another specific unit using a specific sensor.

Also, you can always activate NVG by clicking your forehead

how about if someone joins in mid game? That would increase the value by 1 Would that break anything?
That I wouldn't mind
thanks a lot man

Hey guys!  I've setup a VTOL competitive league! (No, not just "another one", or "just a tournament"). We are setting up a full season with rankings, weekly matches, and a season ending tournament in November.  With this massive undertaking, we as a community need some balanced PVP mission.  Itt doesn't need to be immediately done.  As of now, our main Mission is going to be the PVP strike mission variants(with additions to the map pool gradually coming).  Honestly if someone can just Copy/Paste that entire map and programming and JUST add a hard time limit of 1hr 15 mins, then the league will be set.    If it can't be copy/pasted or just edited simply, then an entire map with EXTREMELY similar layout would be much loved.    Let me know if anyone is interested in joining as a player, or joining up as a map/mission consultant.

Id like to see some of the asymmetric pvp go into that league. I cant remember who it was that made it though. @Strikeeaglechase If i remember you were there during the asymetric pvp match yea? when I was flying a helo and i think you and the map maker were flying low tech
@Browning made that map.
Thank you i couldnt remember. I'd love to see something like that for a tourny

I'm in now way an expert in this stuff.  :). I did look at the map and misson editor IN GAME, didnt find a way to do it there, scanned thru the local files on my PC for the map to add to the editor folders but couldnt find it, and the official map isn't posted by BahamutoD that I could see.  So I got stuck in the mud on this.  Perhaps BahamutoD can simply add the premade map to the workshop and we just DL it from there?  Idk how to proceed.  :)
Missions on the workshop are in a special compiled format that cannot be edited. Only the original creator has access to the files needed to edit a mission. EDIT: Without breaking EULA and the trust of mission creators everywhere.
Noice.  Idk why I read @Strikeeaglechase as "Strike Eagle Cheese", but he's part of the league and will surely put some effort towards this project once it gets underway, so we should be set.

It's not steam encryption

Could someone link some form of tutorial for PvP missions? Instead of just dropping 86 questions in chat that get answered in 2 seconds
For context: I wanna make a pvp mission where you need to do a couple of objectives to win
and also get kills at the end

how can i make it so that the bots only fire on incomming armament instead of atacking players? i'm trying to make a multiplayer mission for me and my friends so we can practise fighting the NFP carrier
Use the ignore target unit event action
(Tell the carrier to ignore the mp spawns)

okay, if i understand correctly i need to go to the event tab and make an event that if a player get's detected he/she get's ignored, right?
i'm pretty new to vtol's editor
You can do it right from the start

so, i've tried setting all my allied unit's to non target for the bot's but they will still shoot me if i come close. am i doing something wrong?
Other way around
Or maybe not

What's in the non-targets "7 selected"?
all of those that are checked are player controlled
Just going to check it myself

is there any way to add fire effects to buildings?
Nope
the only way ive found is to use one of those crashed kestrel props and shoved them into the houses lmao

But all the hesco walls and similar? Go wild
ahhhh okay wonderful then
what about the kestrels

should i just leave the behavior as is?
All the default behaviour stuff is overridden by any event actions the unit receives
very nice.

How did you do this*?
put a crashed kestrel prop on the floor or the same level as whatever it is you want the fire to come out of  hold middleclick and drag it into an object **without letting go of middleclick, press spacebar**  voila
holy shit.

Is there a way to snap platforms together so there is no height difference? . If I do it currently I get a slight increase in height for every platform.
If you start at the high end, you might be able to set the altitude so that the rest are the same
Might also try Bishop's middle click drag trick ^

OK appreciate the responses - never tried file editing, and wouldn't know what to tweak etc - but do you start by opening the mission file in a text editor? - if this is too big a subject to get into - no worries at all - please ignore the question 👍
I can absolutely show you
It's really easy, it's a raw text file that uses the KSP file save format

OK really appreciate it and would be interested to learn. Where do I start - going to bed soon but will try to view the mission file tomorrow on a break. Do I need to download a specific file reader for the KSP file save format?
Nope
just any text editor will work

If i spawn in some bombers on a path, is there a way to keep their speed the same the whole time?
seems like they keep speeding off even after i set in an event their initial speed to slow
I think it depends what action you give them. If they are just flying to a nav point they should follow their set nav speed.

@Sypwn Did you remove the 145s from the delta internal bays?
yeah
Ah lol

@Sypwn so delta is going to be literally just bombs and guns?
F-45As still have wing pylons
they also still have their aim-9s

So.... self defense and the entire principle of multirole out the window?
if the F45 was crippled like that in the main game, i would understand your frustration. but i think this makes dynlib more fun and team based
I disagree

if we had 4 fully capapble F45 noone would ever play the other aircraft, becausewhy should you? you can just do everything with it at once. no need for dedicated cap and a2g players.
I mean if he does end up making jaidenskymode that will probably end up being a 45 will a2g and a2a
I would still play the 26 because the 26 is fun! I play dynlib to have a good time, not do actual coop, because coop is not happening in a pub lobby, no matter how hard you try

how do I import a standalone mission into a mp campaign?
when I paste the mission file into the campaign and try to upload it just says no player spawn
well you have to add player spawns to a mp mission..

do I need to place a spawn everywhere I want players to spawn?
Yes?
it only lets me make 1 player spawn

Can we get a slash macro that explains about MP campaigns and how to convert to one?
Shadow is the one to talk to about that
But he’s mentioned he dosnt want to bloat it too much

Is it possible for team B in MP missons to have a fully working AWACs? I can't get mine to do picture/bogey dope callouts.
@Skumby good morning my man i tried to launch my mission again, and while it did work, it didnt display in vr. meaning i couldnt do shit with it. what am i to do?
Does it display on the monitor? Does anything appear in your headset? Do you see the helmet scene, or the map load scene, or the team scene or the slot selection scene?

Damnit, I am trying to get an enemy group (Alpha) to Spawn as a group randomly in one place or another. But the Spawn Index doesn't let me change it.  Doesn't seem to allow me to edit "idx" but only if this has been placed within a FIRE CONDITIONAL ACTION. Is there a better way to do this?
Alt spawns sound like what you want
You don't need to use a conditional action to get them to work

ok so just spawn then and let the weight figure it out, so long as they're in a group they'll be together?
So all the members of the group will use the same alt spawn index
ohh i seee....

Can you not put two prox triggers, one on each of spawn 1 and 2, that spawns a bunker on 1 or 2 if it sees members of alpha nearby?
That's a clever idea
does proxy only affect spawned units?

does proxy only affect spawned units?
Yup, non-spawned units don't exist. Or shouldn't exist. If unalive people trigger a trigger, that's a bug
You'll have a little more work testing to see if the bunker's dead, as now there'll be two bunkers that you'll have to check, but at least you'll have your units and bunker spawning together

Global variable tracking the state of...reinforcement?
phases
so to speak

but its a pain to find out how many are dead and use that number to spawn X amount? I thought you can't compare values.
I figured. fek
Or rather it'd be several, in a conditional action

How do you get to the team selection if it doesn't show on the HMD? Does it show the first few scenes on the HMD then stop?
it literally just opens on either scene, on my monitor. nothing on the HMD other than the virtual desktop thing
You using virtual desktop, or link/airlink?

You using virtual desktop, or link/airlink?
im not sure what it's called but its just the regular oculus link via cable
i didn't install any third party apps

Are you using oculus mode or the default SteamVR?
default steamvr
i use oculus link to make it a PCVR headset and then all of my games run with steamvr

And you're starting SteamVR before starting VTOL VR?
nope, launches automatically right before the game does
Try starting SteamVR before starting VTOL VR. Does the game appear in your headset before you enter the mission editor? Does it show "Mission Editor uses your monitor" when you're in the editor?

will do the game does appear in my headset before i launch the mission editor and it does give me the text yeah
I honestly don't know. I've not heard of anyone having issues like this. Most people have trouble right from the start, not from it breaking half way through

Is it a multiplayer mission?
yes
two seater heli type thing

if i have this set for the entire group, do they attack anything close by that is considered hostile or do they focus on the player?
They'll attack anything
You can set priority targets if you want them to focus on something

is there any way to start this event on objective start?
the enemies do not spawn until the 2nd objective starts
You might want to increase the Count too, otherwise it'll be the saddest carpet bombing ever

so if i begin the objective i can set the event to trigger and the enemies will begin the attack on the selected targets?
Should do, yeah
You'll want to make sure the Enabled check box is not checked in the CarpetbombEvent, so it doesn't activate itself until you trigger it

wait so if the event already is set to begin with objective two, what do i do with all the stats here?
Whatever you want
It's all entirely irrelevent

The Backstop are SARH or ARM?
pretty sure they're SARH
what would be their usage over BSM?

what would be their usage over BSM?
I'm not really familiar with Allied ground and stationary units :/
The backstop are Enemy tho AFAIK.

@Sypwn Any chance you could take a look at a campaign and figure out why its causing a black screen?
Its an invalid character in file path but I don't see any invalid characters anywhere
That sounds familiar

is it possible to make the multiplayer spawns on a carrier work if the carrier is moving? it seems like the fleets of ships are typically in motion, but I'm wondering about how you'd go about setting up spawns for a multiplayer carrier-op mission where you start on the carrier. strikes me that you'd get left behind and spawn in the air if you didn't spawn in like, instantly all together
You attach the spawns to the carrier and they will move with it.
I'm getting a screenshot...

So, had converted my map from SP to MP, and there was a glitch where the AH-94 could not requip the GAU, probably from restricted weapon selection. How do I fix this? I assume I need to edit the VTC or VTS file
The patch notes for the latest public testing update addressed that I think >     - Fixed: Could not rearm when a singleplayer mission with forced equips is converted to multiplayer
But I've also seen apparently rearming is janky right now either way?

Howdy peeps. If I set a carrier and some cruisers as a group, and then tell the carrier to follow a path, will the other ships follow? Also, I want to create an objective where the player has to deliver troops to a secret base in some mountains. If they are spotted, I have it set up so there is a trigger if the player is detected. What I want to know, is if there is a way to disable that trigger after the objective of dropping off troops has been completed successfully without be spotted. I know you can cancel an objective, but can you cancel triggers on objective completion?

> Howdy peeps. If I set a carrier and some cruisers as a group, and then tell the carrier to follow a path, will the other ships follow? You have to order **the group** to follow the path for them to move in formation.

That you! I assume I need a trigger to get the group to move since I can't select groups to issue orders.

Yes, or you can use the start actions from one of your objectives.

Okay. What would be the best method to get rid of the detection trigger? I am very confused looking at sequences. 😦
I'm away from my computer right now, but you want to create a **completed action** in the objective, to **stop** the conditional event you created.
Thank you!

Is there a way of disabling specific weapons on the enemy ships by adding lines to the   .vts file? Want enemy carrier to have AA guns but no active Sam's.
I don't believe thats possible
You can specifically destroy those weapons with trigger actions, but they will appear on fire. Maybe you can come up with an explanation such as a preemptive attack.

Thanks for the responses guys. Destroying them with a trigger would help. Also to save testing do you know if a carrier / gunship would attack a ground target with on guns  - specifically a storage tent? Or will they only fire on aircraft.
No idea, never tested.
OK no worries - all to do with a bit of a different mission approach I'm trying. 👍

CIWS might be able to target ground units????? Im not sure,  I kind of doubt that
Geez it only takes like 2 mins to test. Of the allied ships, only the cruiser's main gun will fire at a ~~ground target~~ tank.
Id have to touch the mission editor tho

Were they within 5km of the ground targets?
If you're scared of the mission editor, then why are you in #mission_editor
Because I can answer some of the mission editor questions kek

Was the testing target within 2km? Im *guessing* it requires a radar lock to fire, but it can *see* tanks
actually no it can't see tanks, but it can see infantry/tents
The target is a tank barely visible near the top center of the screenshot.

Then what, tents? Landed aircraft?
Id try infantry, or tent's
or both

I need some help. I made a mission and I can't upload it. Anyone know what's going on?
upload your log
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

is that a multiplayer mission/campaign?
nope

Some people say to just try again later. Some people mention problems with using family sharing. Some people say the files they are trying to upload are too big.

Does the mission have really large briefing pictures or lots of background music or something?
it got some 8 custom voicelines and a few fotos
As for the DNS error, if you are the one responsible for your internet connection and you don't have any custom networking hardware (3rd party gaming router, Pihole, etc) then you can call your ISP for support

How do I put 'notes' into the. Vts file please? Putting a lot of static objects in and wanted to put a note/name in next to an object ID so I know which are for what area  on the map. Do I have to put it inside a certain type of bracket?
Not sure if it's possible without the comments getting wiped the next time you save it from in the editor.
No worries - thanks anyway. Will have to find a pen a paper 😂

Is it possible (in theory) to make a mission that randomly generates objectives and spawns enemies (as in a mission generator)?
through mods yeah, but in base game the closest thing you can do is make a bunch of objectives yourself and have them randomly activate
missions like Killbox and Dynamic Lib do this

quick question, are triggered events permanent on do the only fire once? I would like to change a global value based on kills/deaths and was wondering if the event would stop after one successful trigger
They are limited to a single firing. We mission creators have been asking Baha for loopable triggers for a while.

so is there a way to use the score system to trigger events? Team A gets 100 points and they win kind of thing?

Best workaround is to create an event sequence with a node for each death, up to whatever limit your sanity allows. It's easier to copy-paste nodes with Notepad++, but that's a whole other can of worms.
ok cool. Thanks for your help Sypwn

really? can't seem to find it
Is the mission part of a MP campaign?
yes its a MP score keeper. I'm attempting a hide and seek map 2x F45 vs 10x FA26B I have a timer, but I wanted to use a scoring system to punish seeker deaths 10 for a kill -5 for a death. I can add it to the score system, but I couldn't find a trigger to pop at a certain score

I'm getting into making missions, any tips?
make sure travel times make sense
don't make the helicopter fly farther than 20nm

One time I had a 53 nm flight. We died. A lot.  But also, do you have to manually add players? Cause right now I have a player spawn on an aircraft carrier, do I have to add more or can they all spawn on the carrier? I only have 1 player spawn identified right now.
iirc you have to put a spawn for every slot you want
Ok, thanks!

Wait are stand alone missions mp?
I cannot add another player spawn
yeah thats one of the biggest things I wanted to stay away from, i'm a heli gunner and sometimes I have to fly solo, I know the pain of flying for 25nm and getting shot down by a slam truck

@AtrociousAmbition/Mr. Charisma would editor tips be too subjective for the wiki?
I wouldn't stop you from making a blog post for it, at least.
I'd need a blog for that

Enemy Rocket Artillery, and MPA-155. What are their maximum ranges in KM?
And before anyone says "2-8KM" to the Rocket Artillery, that's if they visually acquire, but if they acquired a target indirectly how far could they launch from. Nevermind accuracy since that can apparently be cheated.
About 25km I think

What happens if not everybody wants to do the same thing?
Each sector has a number of events that result in the map being threatened by enemies every time the player does something
The choice comes down to a single AV-42 who selects an option

Oh, so one holds power?
Hah! I like it.
The map is built for 6 AH-94's and 1 AV42

Seems interesting! I really wanna see how this unfolds as a campaign! How many missions are there?
Sectors are between 7k to 20k apart, so travel distances will be optimized to allow plenty of action inbetween
It's one mission, not a campaign

Cool! So what's the main priority so far?
Just filling out sectors will enemies, connecting it all. and of course balance testing this

Is their default behaviour set to follow a path or parked until triggered?
Default is navigate path
Only difference between them is hull number

And they are near the path to be able to travel it? Do you have a screenshot of the properties and path?
Actually thats the issue
thank you

Was trying to do a target practice type training map with a bunch of different target groups/regions with different types of ground targets/threats that would respawn after you killed them all in a given area.  example-  'Alpha' group of enemy tanks is a tank column.. say like 10 vehicles that spawn immediately, follow a path that loops.  an Event is set that when numalive of 'Alpha' = 0, then it would force spawn unit group 'Alpha'  i tried that, but i guess the 'spawn' function only spawns units that have not ever been alive, rather than spawning units that were once alive and now dead... so...  anybody got any other ideas that don't require me to just manually add a TON of units in individual, finite waves to spawn one after another?
how do I have multiple types of aircraft and choose where they spawn. I only have access to 1 player spawn so do I just put aircraft spawns?
I know I can add alt spawns but I cant change their squad per alt spawn

@illumi i think i had the same confusion- you're probably trying to do a single mission, right?  like, instead of creating a 'campaign'?  the 'mission' or whatever that's sort of a stand-alone one-shot deal doesn't work quite the same... no reason to really use it as far as i can tell

build your thing as a 'campaign' so that you can make it multiplayer if you want. then you can place as many 'Player Spawn' items as you want instead of just one... and you can set which vehicle each one is.
when you make a 'Campaign' instead of a little one-shot mission, you can make missions inside the campaign, and they can support numerous player spawns for each team. each spawn can then be set to a specific vehicle and squad.

what are you guys' favorite text-to-speech tools for making audio clips for missions?
There a way to start the mission without going into vr just to see if certain things work?
@Pjork so, you can do testing from in the editor, but you WILL have to put your headset on for like just a second.

Hey, quick question: I am making my first mission but when I attempt to upload for multiplayer testing it gives me a warning that reads ‘the game doesn’t have any fail safes for if it loads an object it doesn’t know and it softlockes peoples games. This will Probably be fixed in an update’. What does this mean? Any help would be great.
seems like its just a heads up that the game is a bit buggy in its current state
as far as i know this is normal

Hey, if I want to have a switch for setting the "engage enemies" status of units, triggered by for example the player locking a bunker with the tgp to activate it, and locking another to deactivate it, how exactly will this affect already launched missiles if the unit being toggled is for example a Missile cruiser?
It won't affect missiles at all, and there is no way to control them with triggers.
Oh wait, missiles require radar lock

how do i get smoke?
a way to make a mission guaranteed last forever is to have one required destroy objective with an invincible unit?
i want any of 12 players to be able to trigger an event by locking on to a specific unit. because i want 10+ of those trigger units, i would like to know if there is a way to do it without having it look like this

Is there any intention of including AWACS in the Dynamic Liberation missions?
I may try and make it a gamemode, but I have no idea how to make missions
I can make a quick mock-up

im unable to add a target for them to board, will they go to the closest allied aircraft without one selected?
A) The only AWACS available in the game is an E-3 Sentry, which cannot be launched from a carrier. If an E-2 Hawkeye or equivalent carrier capable AWACS was made available, I would consider it. B) Personally I find the AWACS callouts quite annoying, especially when I'm in an F-45 with full situational awareness, and AFAIK there is no way to mute them without muting all team comms.  Voice acting is coming soon™️ which may include some degree of reinforcement callouts. Until then, it should be the role of Alpha to call out new threats.
you can independently control comms for AI and other team members

is this a standalone mission?
You probably created a singleplayer mission. To create multiple player spawns, the mission has to be inside a multiplayer campaign. To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign 2. Import your mission into the campaign 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer.
yes

any chance someone could help me with this?
i do not know
I've never used troop pickup, and I'm not near pc right now.

and does anybody know if completion rewards go to everyone or the person who completed the objective?
also do budgets actually do anything? the cost went over-budget, but it didnt restrict it at all
Maybe not in multiplayer. I don't know of anyone else that uses them.

is there a way to make enemy units respawn? Ik you can force them to spawn, force them to spawn alternate places, but does any of those make them respawn?
how do you get a carrier group to stay together and follow a path?
No. You have to fake it by making multiple copies of the unit.

Put them all in the same group, then use a UnitGroup trigger action to command them to move.

Does this happen to be allied cruisers against enemy GAV-25?
and asf 30's
- AI are really good at beaming/notching and using CM - Allied cruiser missiles appear to have a pretty small splash zone - GAV-25s can take A LOT of damage Added up, it can take 8+ cruiser missiles to take down a single GAV-25

@Sypwn got a link to some documentation of how to edit the files in notepad for that purpose? I'm plenty comfortable messing around with text for stuff like that as long as I know the notation or whatever
Use Notepad++. Beyond, that, it's all in english, and the syntax is relatively self-explanatory. I feel like "if you need a guide, you shouldn't be doing it". Just make a backup of your mission, then start messing around. You can ping me with specific questions. Chase also wrote some JS code to convert the VTS to JSON, or something like that.
As for how to convert a mission between SP and MP: Make a SP campaign and create a blank mission with only a player spawn Make a MP campaign and create a blank mission with only a player spawn Compare the two VTS files to see what's different. That shows you what you need to change to convert between the two.

how does spawning on the carrier work? do I have to put down mp spawns and parent them to the carrier or something?
nvm i gotit
@Sypwn or anybody else really... what's the difference between these values? i assume the 'initial delay' is only relevant if you have the 'Begin Immediately' box checked... right?  so if I want a timed event to start 25 seconds after the completion of an objective, I can put that as an action in the complete objective section... and the way I have this set would do that?

`Initial delay` effectively adds that delay to ALL nodes in that timed group
so regardless of when the whole group is triggered to start, it's just a buffer. so doesn't matter if it starts immediately or not

Where do I put the feature requests?
Because I wanted to modify the loading screen graphic and it...didn't turn out the way I had hoped ;p
Also, apparently in testing, when you set Invincible when launched from Editor, the Invincibility flag only applies to the first vehicle. Not subsequent respawns.

I was told height.png was the one to edit. I guess that's wrong?
I thought it was one of the two, not sure
As I understand, preview is only shown in the editor thumbnail and thats all?

As I understand, preview is only shown in the editor thumbnail and thats all?
I see that you've had this discussion with RED already
Either way it shouldn't have changed the map mesh itself even if you modified heat.png unless you regenerated the heightmaps

Ah but in game the terrain was fine?
Yep terrain was fine
Interesting

any tricks to get an unit to takeoff?
iv set a taxi path to the runway, and a proximity trigger to comand overlord to take off, it plays the radio audio when the trigger is set but it doesnt takeoff
Don't taxi them to the runway. Let them do that themselves.

Is the airbase properly configured and owned by that team?
in the Bases tab
yes

Could someone help with this?
I can't figure out why they wont follow the path
I've also tried rail path

Damn is so hard to get a mission to work properly.. Am i too dumb? Lol
Lots of trial and error
Keep forgeting to link the correct triggers to the right things and timing argh...

is there a way i can set sams and mad4 not to attack a specific target?

There's an action to "set non-target", but it gets weird with stationary SAM sites

Hey, I'm trying to have some infantry advance on a city, but when I drew a path they all ended up lining up in a big conga line. If I want them to all just walk forward do I need to draw a path for them all individually?
When using a path, they will walk to the path then follow it exactly.  If you want them to walk toward the city independently, you should instead create a waypoint and tell them to walk to it. If you want them to instead move along the path but in a different formation, make them all members of a group, then (using an action) tell the entire group to follow the path.
which behavior makes them all walk towards a waypoint?

which behavior makes them all walk towards a waypoint?
Telling each one individually to walk to the waypoint
either as an action ~~or by default behavor~~ EDIT: didn't realize infantry don't have a Move To Waypoint behavior...

Or is it through events?
Actions must be created either by an event, or though an objective
Got it, thank you!

Also, are allied forces way stronger than enemy forces? When I did a test run the allies killed all the enemies pretty quickly
I'm not sure, sorry. I haven't really worked with allied units much.
Ok, thanks for the help!

why do my KC-49 tanker and UARV refueling drones not show up when I go ingame? do they need an E-4 AWACS?
define "not show up"
they're not in the comms menu, so I cant communicate to them to request aerial refueling

are they not supposed to-?
I've never done aerial refueling tbh but I assumed thats how its done
I've never used em :/

do you know what speed the auto nav is set to? when I set it to 250 it flies at like mach 0.8-0.9 so it's definitely not knots
Most units within the editor are metric, the speed is in m/s
that would explain why its traveling at nearly the speed of sound instead of 260 knots...

when making aerial units, is there an easy way to make them fly in formation? or do I need to make a separate path for each unit?
Put them all in a group, then, using an event action, tell the entire UnitGroup to move somewhere
If you tell each plane to go somewhere individually, they will do so independently. But if you tell the group to move using a UnitGroup action, they will do so in formation.

even if its a path?
yes
Found 5 people playing my first map in the server browser

Does Objective Clear action not work in multiplayer?
you mean cancel?
yes

🤔 You sure about that?
It usually writes the reason the objective can't be cancel to player.log if you try
Oh ok... Hmmmmm

What does the log say?
Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state None! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state None! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state None! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed!
but with objectives like Pick up and Drop off which I need to complete, this won't help me

Are you canceling the objective at the same moment it's being completed?
nope, after a "PHASE" is completed
Can I cancel it upon completion?

Can I cancel it upon completion?
Then that could be a bug. I can dig into it tomorrow.
Don't try.

now how do i upload it then?
with the upload button
didn't work

Did you change any of the mission files manually?
You could also try changing it directly in the workshop
Or delete the workshop entry if you don't care about the stats

did you rename the ~~mission~~ campaign files directly or edit them with notepad?
I'm trying to change the campaign name
not the individual mission

in the vts file for a mission, can you increase the number of targets (to destroy) past 50? idk if it actually works
Yes
Also limit?

like i have more targets than i can set as minimum required so if i edit the vts file itll increase minimum needed?
You could just use a conditional objective UnitList [Units] Number Alive Is 0 The only downside is the OBJ screen loses the unit counter, but you may consider that an acceptable loss.
Ok thanks

Is there anywhere that states how much damage each weapon does and how much health things have?  I have an allied cruiser I want to travel across a path. I want to endanger it with enemies that players have to take out before too much damage is done, but I don't want to kill this cruise too easily, or by chance.  Obviously putting a bunch of infantry isn't really going to kill it, so I need something dangerous, but not deadly. Thoughts?
For weapon stats I created this   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLWW-bbyfJEuQnnMmhSoCq39m3Ge5fxL11G_qbVDd88/edit  Iv been wanting to create stats for AI units for a while but it’s a lot more complex
Ah well if this isn't AI, that doesn't help me unfortunately.

How do I make a mission where you have the option of going on team B?
I'd like to setup something where you're going against "Allied" units
make a multiplayer mission, and ad player slots for team b

And how do I make a mp mission? I only see options for standalone, campaign, and steam workshop
I assumed it was an option somewhere for standalone but can't find it
you need to make a campaign, when creating it there will be an option to make it multiplayer

Couldn't seem to find what railpath does online, could someone please explain it? 😅
The same thing as Path. It's leftover from some old mechanics iirc
Ah okay, thank you!

when making a mission how do i ge tthe ground units to move? i have a path n have them set to follow it currently
Did you set behavior to path, and set the default path?
for the tank i set the path to the path i created just a straight linear line

Did you set behavior to path, and set the default path?

You need to set Behavior to Path (or maybe Follow Path), and you have to set the Default Path to the path you created. Have you done both of these?

@Sypwn are you able to despawn/deactivate ground radars/units after an obj is completed?
Deactivate, yes. "Engage enemies" can be toggled for most units. Definitely the MAD-4 at least.  Despawn, no
What I'm saying is that it's sorta possible using some trickery, as long as it doesn't involve destroying units.

id figure a mountain range ordeal?
But with all AH-94s, as you suggested. Makes more sense
Ask the PvP players what they think

@Temperz87 @Kazper @Strikeeaglechase @Jaidensky   (im missing some but these are the ones i know)  For an Ah-94 domination game mode would you guys prefer a mountain range, plains, valley, or something else?
i feel special thank you for involving me i would prefer a mountain range personally, but i dont do much heli flying
As in AH-94 a2a combat?

I would say so yea
i dont do much a2a in the 94 myself

Is there a good video or readable guide on good ways to balance missions? thats the one thing I'm not really sure on 😅
play and adjust unit count and posistion accordingly
yep

and SAMs et al. just kind of go as much as feels right, right?
some sams have their counterparts on both teams, i would recommend going to PT as it will be more balanced since currently you have more SAM options
some things to note:

how do I make tunnels??
you can't
the akutan map is special

can you manually edit anythings position?
you put a waypoint where you want the object to be, then you go into the .vts and copy the waypoint's coords and paste it as the object's coords
A) Don't use Windows Notepad to edit the .vts, or else it will screw up the line endings. Use Notepad++ or another more advanced text editor. B) After making .vts changes outside the game, you must completely quit out of VTOL to reload your changes into the game.

do I also need to change lastValidPlacement, or only globalPosition?
The helicarrier isn't real... or possible
dunno, try both

I am introducing myself to the editors. I started working on a campaign. I would like for the second mission to get many assets back as they were set up in the first mission. Positions of radars, SAM, docks, bunkers, etc I don‘t see a button to duplicate a mission. How can I do that?
"Save as"
i can make them taller the same way i made the mecha carrier stand of the water

hey all, If this is off topic let me know where to put it. I extracted and ported the Operation: Desert Cobra campaign to the F-45 and have been playing through it to test it. I have no desire to take credit for it as all I did was change 2-3 values but I think it's a cool demonstration of how differently things play out in a 5th Gen plane vs a 4th Gen plane. Is there a rule against posting this campaign to the Steam Workshop?
Well ask Baha he made the campaign

yo Sypwn, you said last night about disabling aircraft carrier catapults by having bots get on the catapult, then get destroyed?  How would I do that? Taxi event, then takeoff? Can I make them go to specific catapults since I only want to disable some?
I wouldn't seriously use that method in a mission
But no, you can't pick catapults. You have to rely on the AI using the same catapults in each run

Why only disable a couple catapults?
side catapults will launch aircraft into a mountainside
Oh

I don't remember where exactly or if it was a mod but can you place down arrestor cables in the editor?
that would be CSA
it's a mod

thats awesome!!! is it mp also ?
I guess I could make MP, I haven't been messing with VTOL VR for long but I assume it's just another value in the mission file
You can ask baha, I asked about the built in PVP strike mission and he said it was fine, but a campaign might be different I dunno, just gotta ask him

Is it possible to make dynamic campaigns? (like Enemy Engaged)
Depends how you define "dynamic". The events of one mission cannot affect another, if that's what you're referring to.
In Enemy Engaged, it's basically a single session where missions are created depending how the war is going between two factions, dynamically creating missions for CAS/Recon etc etc as needed.

Can I add it later?
or do I need to reupload as a new map?

Yes, by updating it. On the Steam page, you can also change what pictures, videos, description it shows, and is much more convenient to use than the in-game tools (mostly because it's a markdown editor)

The answer will be in the player.log
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Does this campaign only have one mission?
Yea
I have the link to the map in the description of Operation Operation First sight if that's the problem

Did you create it as a singleplayer mission then convert it to multiplayer? If so, what method did you use?
I didn’t convert it, I’m not at my pc atm but I’ll try that as soon as I get home which is in about 15-30 minutes
these are the settings I've had for a while so I'm not sure why its missing

Question on the Default Behavior for units: I've set units for a triggered airborne spawn with the orders to attack a specific priority target, so it likely wouldn't matter which behavior I set, correct? Otherwise I *could* set it to Path mode but if the target is in motion, there's no guarantee that it would be at any specified point at that moment
Priority target means they will attack that target when they detect it. Until then, they will follow default behavior and attack other units.  Dedicated target means they will ignore their default behavior and go straight for the target you specified.  In both cases, be sure the add priority/dedicated targets actions happen *after* the spawn unit action.

You cannot do it from the editor otherwise, no
Dammit okay

Could this be done with a waypoint?
yes
yes

Is it possible to participate in a multiplayer session where we just edit missions?
no
best you can do is screen share

Is there any plan to allow the editing of workshop scenarios & campaigns?
They are specifically made so you cannot steal them
What if you don't steal, you simply improve the mission and re-upload? Just accredit the original author?

What if you don't steal, you simply improve the mission and re-upload? Just accredit the original author?
Cant trust people for that, this is the Internet we're talking about
Ask the author if they are willing to make a variant with those improvements, or if they will send you the mission files so you can.

ey does anyone know how to stop the AI twerking when following a path? I've tried speed and weight changes on the aircraft, which helps a bit, and also changing the path type to linear, bezier, smooth and also all the altitudes on the waypoints are equal, so it's not like they're step climbing or something... The same aircraft fly buttery smooth when just heading to a waypoint or RTB etc, so I'm pretty sure it's the path, or they way AI responds to paths...
twerking?
F-45 too:

anyone knows how to fix infinite loading screen?
infinite ram?
wow

What does repacking the map do?
If create a map, then create a mission with it, then go back and edit the map, your map changes won't show up in the mission until you "repack" it.
isnt that what saving is for?

isnt that what saving is for?
?
like if I save the mission doesnt it do the exact same?

like if I save the mission doesnt it do the exact same?
you can't edit the map from within the mission editor
you have to edit the map in the map editor

if i repack the map on an existing mission (minor changes) does it delete the units?
No
I just tried

Will this make the units drive to the waypoint?
Or do I need to change the behaviour to path for that?
it should

Or do I need to change the behaviour to path for that?
it should
as a wise man once said (who is tragically not in the server anymore) create an event that tells the entire unit group to move to a waypoint

Will they automatically just follow the road?
No. For that you have to make a path that perfectly follows the road
God damit

And let me guess the path cant just automatically stick to the road I have to actually like do that myself?
its just a bunch of points
dont worry about it

@Sypwn are you still up to make the helo competitive mission if i provide you a map?
sure
awesome

We're talking about a mode where two teams are trying to simultaneously hold 2 or 3 points, and can contest any of them at any time, right?
```        ----> Point 1 <----       /                   \ Team A                     Team B  Base                       Base       \                    /        ----> Point 2 <----```
The alternative is where the capture points are in a line and the teams are only contesting a single point at a time. ```Team A <-----> Point 1 <-----> Point 2 <-----> Team B```

Ok, do you want two or three points?
the alternative that would also be more performant is the same layout of the first however it would be 3 points each side
so

iirc you said you can have vics turn on or off equipment based on other things yea?
Each team base is defended by invincible SAMS.
Oh yeah, we can have invincible MAD-4 that turn on and off

well, sorta. Does team A have MAD-4?
the problem with that is they units for each team are not identical
The domination mode you are depicting avoids one of the main roles of the helo which is ground attack

🤔 how do you do your pop up spawns in dyn lib?
they only spawn once
how many do you have set up O.o

its almost like there are x number of straight segments in a path loop, but when the path gets really big, those straight segments, (or intervals?) get really far apart and the wobble gets noticeable. On short paths you can see the elevators wobbling really quickly but since its so fast it doesn't really do anything to the aircrafts flight path.
Note that none of this happens when flying to waypoints
does anybody know if there is any way to force enemy sam sites  to remain with the radar off until an event is triggered, other than making them spawn at that point?

Engage Enemies should control their radar state. I know it does for the MAD-4 at least.
thanks!!

how do i make a mision mutiplayer?
check the MP box and make sure you have MP spawns
It has to be in a multiplayer campaign.

i want to add wingmen and i want then to take off only when i tell then how do i do that?
set them to parked
and use an editor condition to tell your squad to take off

trigger event? I dont remember the name
ohhhhhhhhhh
where is the option to edit the score required to end the game for a multiplayer mission?

where is the option to edit the score required to end the game for a multiplayer mission?
Should be in the Scenario Info dialog
Am I blind or is it just not a option to change

So you would edit the objective instead?
Oh, there isn't a fixed limit? You just use a conditional objective?
I thought that was how missions with point-based objectives worked?

Oh, there isn't a fixed limit? You just use a conditional objective?
I thought that was how missions with point-based objectives worked?

I thought that was how missions with point-based objectives worked?

I've never actually made a pvp mission before but I had assumed for stuff like the inbuilt helicopter pvp

I have an objective with a single success condition:  Num (Player Group) Airborne > 0  And no matter what I do I can't seem to get that to return true.  I've taken off, flown to 20k ft, left the area, nothing seems to register that I am airborne.   What am I doing wrong?
I just tested this and you're right, it's bugged. I'll report it to Baha. Until it's fixed, you'll have to check `Is Not Landed` for each player and feed them all into an `OR` block.
is it a player group bug or a "airborn" bug? Could I just do (Player Group) > Is Not > All Landed?

is it a player group bug or a "airborn" bug? Could I just do (Player Group) > Is Not > All Landed?
Oh, forgot that was an option. I'm testing that now.
Nope, that doesn't seem to work either. I suspect UnitGroups are buggy when players are involved.

Hey all, new to VTOL mission editing here. Is there a way to "loop" or "reset" a trigger/objective sequence during a mission, or once they've triggered do they stay triggered for the duration?
Nope, no trigger looping.
Ok cheers. Back to the drawing board for me 😂

Is there a way to switch this radius value between spherical/cylindrical?
I think Unit and UnitGroup use different, one is spherical and the other is cylindrical, but I can't remember which is which.
But I do agree it should be a checkbox

Is UnitList cylindrical? Might be a possible workaround
Oh yeah. I meant to say UnitList. But again I don't remember which is cylindrical and which is spherical.
You'll have to test

Where do you find the maps of the default mp missions?
The one I used came included in the maps folder.
Like, it was already in the map editor

thats why im trying to get it, andy has done the same, do any of you know where to find these?
@Strikeeaglechase
Ill grab it in a bit

does "unit list" only need one unit to execute the logic?
yeah, but in that case, why not just use regular "unit" ?
well i did play the mission and killed one of the SAMs and it completed the mission.

yeah, but in that case, why not just use regular "unit" ?

you have Is Not All Alive

What're you trying to achieve?
Kill all 109 guys and thing happens?
yes

Kill all 109 guys and thing happens?
yes
then set Num Alive, then set the value to 0

Just curious, I haven't touched the mission editor at all yet, but how many teams can you have in a mission? Is it a maximum of two, or can you do 3 teams all fighting each other?
max 2
its fairly integral to how the game is setup to support only 2

Do infantry just hop into the av-42c if their in a certain radius or do I have to trigger something?
oh also can you add more stuff to a campaign after its already released on steam?
From the wiki. "Passenger transport is facilitated through objectives and triggers in the Mission Editor"

Not sure how one would go about doing it, but it apparently isn't automatic.

anyone know if the MPA-155 can shoot while moving or do they need to be parked?
If given the command to fire, they will automatically stop.

How do I disable Team B in a multiplayer scenario I'm making?
just don't make any player spawn points on team b

How do I disable Team B in a multiplayer scenario I'm making?
just don't make any player spawn points on team b
I want it to be a Co-op mission, and set Team B's player count to 0 but there's still an option to join whenever I launch the mission in the editor

Should I just make them ASF-30 or ASF-33's or something?
Try designated, not priority
Priority will only work if the unit actually detects the priority targets, otherwise it will follow its normal behavior

Maybe they are not equipped with them by standard. Have you looked if you van equip them?
They have the guns equipped already and they do use them. They just ignore my priority targets
After careful consideration

@Sypwn so to confirm, let's say I have a game with 5 matches, I can call the game loop from itself and it will work?
and after 5 rounds, I exit it?
"a game with 5 matches" what are you talking about?

and after 5 rounds, I exit it?
"a game with 5 matches" what are you talking about?
Inside a singular mission, there are multiple matches of players PvPing

"a game with 5 matches" what are you talking about?
Inside a singular mission, there are multiple matches of players PvPing
After everything, I wish to clean it up and restart it

can I make it call itself?
**IF** each sequence node has the exact same entry/exit conditions, and only have a single action of calling an identical Conditional Action, then there is a shortcut to duplicate that sequence node any number of times.
via the VTS file

so what was capable of calling itself?
Because entry conditions, exit conditions, and conditional actions are all referenced by ID. So if you duplicate the node, they will all continue to point to the same IDs
By manually editing the vts, you can make a conditional action call itself.

would that work in this case?
It's not very useful because it still has to resolve within a single frame
got it

Is there a way to duplicate a mission if you want to create a similar but slightly different mission?
save-as
Save As

Did a little preliminary checks to see if you can copy/paste events but just to make sure does anyone know for sure if you can or cannot and any possible workarounds if you can't?
@Sypwn
I'm not sure if I understand the question. There are no ways to duplicate events or actions in the editor, but it can be done manually with a text editor if you're careful. There is no way to make a condition loop forever.

Hey all. So I have a fueling tanker follow a path, then at the end of the path, hit a proximity trigger to tell it to land. It flies to the air field, but then just circles like its in a holding pattern. There are no other units in the game other than the player spawn. The whole action is 5 sec timer - take off. When Not landed - set path. Proximity trigger at path end. Unit Land & Set path to none. I have watched it all the way in Dev mode an all seems to work until it arrives at the airfield. Any ideas?
After testing the mission, check your player.log. Specifically, search it for the name/ID of that tanker. Lots of AI behavior is logged there and it may say why it wont land.
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Sup yall. Easy question: Do you need to manually cause enemy planes to take off? Like setting taxi path, holding patterns, take off timers, etc? Or does the game realize there are enemies in a base and does it automatically?
The airbase ATC coordinates takeoff for both players and AI. Unlike most players, AI will actually follow it. This is assuming you set their default behavior to "TakeOff" or command them to take off using an action.
Oh wow that's cool, awesome

What can cause a mission to try to load but never start ?
A few things, many of them have been fixed in the next build in public_testing.
If this is a multiplayer mission, double check that you have at least one MP spawn point, that you have NO "Player" (singleplayer) spawn points, and that your player counts are correct in the mission options.

does anyone know if changing whether the drone carriers engages enemies also affects the drones after they have launched?
whenever i start my mission the aircraft carrier instantly explodes, anyone know how to fix this?
nvm i forgot abt an obj that I put on the enemy team

what's the best way to delay an action?

what's the best way to delay an action?
For my mission after an objective completes I want a unit to wait x amount of time before moving
Either a timed event or an event sequence. If it's just a one-off like that, create a timed event and make it start when the objective completes.

Is there any way to force an allied unit onto the enemy team? Trying to add an enemy tanker to a mission.
currently no
but both teams are able to refuel off the allied tanker

Will enemy AIs automatically approach an allied tanker without shooting it down?
oh i don't think enemy AI can refuel off the tanker
but Team B in mp can

Does anyone happen to know if you can set the default location of the cursor when you load a mission? It's annoying to keep having to pan across my map whenever I do work
Wish it would just remember my last location
zoom out and double click

I don't suppose there's a way to disable the IFF brackets from appearing?  And before anyone says "Set Forced Undetected". That does not affect this.
Unfortunately not by the mission maker.
Not a great screenshot, but what I am referring are the Blue () and Red <>

Wouldn't it also not work due to TGP IFF?
That's not gonna work, lol
I am ok with it working on the TGP for gameplay

Why does it have to be the AV-42 that spots them?
Yeah 42c dosn't have radar at all, only the 94 can radar detect infantry
choppers do, but I suspect they'll be flying circles above the parked av-42 and radar clicking numberous targets that are packed together isnt going to play well on a MDF

Looks like you repacked your map to the wrong map?
can't tell much from that screenshot
what?

What the playercount/aircraft type? Seems like the perfect job for 2 26's running 4 CAGMs each
fair
Oh... yeah I dunno about that tbh lol. You'll have to heavily limit the 45, otherwise a single 45 is going to take out every oil rig lol

I want to simulate a explosion. Is there a way to "CHECK X UNITS IN AREA" and Destroy them?  I know I can do a condition that checks (if ANY from UNIT LIST is in Radius of Waypoint, but, that wouldn't let me filter those that are in range to destroy them)
the most effective way would be to either use an If-else block and check all possible conditions
or check them individually one after the other then blow em up

do the doors on hangers open automatically if there is an aircraft inside?
Yes
ok

Hey guys! Is there a way to simulate runway destruction? I have several gps coordinates placed on a runway. The plan is the player should release gps bombs, and when they hit all the gps points, the objective will complete.
However, i have no idea how to register bombs' hits on the coordinates.
It's there a way?

Is it possible to place destructible buildings like tents *under* the runway? If possible that would be a cleaner method of detecting the impacts
No
file editing?

Anybody know how the backstop launcher compare to the B enemy team options?  e.g. is the missile roughly as good as the enemy team SARH SAMs?
backstop is a BSM-66 equivalent
Rad, thx

Still pretty short range though, no?  Not hucking telephone poles like the MAD-4 after all.
I havn't tested
It's nice to at least have one set of "matched" SAMs for balancing, anyway.

Hey I've made a few missions now that people couldn't join half way through (it would say 'mission failed ' or something when they load into the server). Anyone know why? I can post links if necessary to my missions

Thanks!

Also, any tips/tutorials for the mission editor? I tried looking at the wiki and the pinned posts. I need help with setting a path for my enemy units to follow. I've created a custom path and selected the path in the unit's menu
I'm confused with the options here
"Tango Group Path" is basically a loop around some roads in the city that I want the tanks to follow

> Also, any tips/tutorials for the mission editor?  https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_tips
Change `Behavior` to `Path`, not `Follow`
But otherwise I think you got it

Let's say there are a group of 4 tanks. Should make all of them Behavior: Path? or just the first one and the other 3 can follow each other?
If you want them to follow the path in formation, you need to use an event action to tell the Tango group to follow the path.
There is also an event action to set which formation they use. You'll probably want `Line` formation.

Quick question: How do I enable the gunner seat spawn for the AH-94 in multiplayer?
should be an option in the unit's settings
drag the allowed slots slider to the right

Is there any functional difference between a 'Player Spawn' and an 'MP Spawn'?
Yes
Player spawns dont work in MP

Do allied ships in vtol have any ground strike potential?
They'll engage some ground targets, but not with missiles
only with their guns

do you by any chance know the approximate range?
no clue, could be anywhere over 10nm lol
I will look into it

what are the values for the pac-3?
like it seems to hit mach 4+ on its booster then struggle to maintain mach 1.5 on sustainer
and if you turn even a minor amount its like subsonic

Or just a cheeky javelin missile?
Need a quick reminder, Say I have a Event sequence with a delay of 900 seconds
Entry condition is obviously conditions need to be met before delay

but does the EXIT condition basically forgoes the remaining timer and start if conditions are true?
Delay -> Wait for entry condition -> Actions -> Wait for exit condition
nothing is ever skipped

but having an exit condition is the same as having a entry condition on the next node correct?
not if there is a delay as well, as that happens before it checks the entry condition
well I have an event sequence. and I want to give the player two options, comply with the objective to land somewhere within 3 minutes and start the event

Great list, can you add dumb-fire rocket ammo to the MANPAD equipables ;)?

It does own it
Have you tried deleting the item from the workshop manually, then uploading again?

Have you tried deleting the item from the workshop manually, then uploading again?
yes, same result
Well, the log says "You're not the owner of this item.", but I don't know what "this item" it's referring to.

is it a mission from scratch?
basically yes I only took the map 'Grand Canyon' and then put all objectives enemies etc in there
When I encountered this issue, it was because the images used in the mission where too large. I think the cap is like 1-2MB. I resized all the images to 512x512p and even smaller for some others and it worked after that

What's up ya'll. If ATC doesn't answer voice comms is that just a bug or did I mess up a setting somewhere in mission editor?
Also most of the time any BGM I use is off for friends playing my missions, is that also a bug?

Give it a completion condition that isn't instantly satisfied?  Can you post a screenshot of the objective panel?
The only way it could be a mission issue is if you didn't label the airbase correctly in the map. It needs to be named in the **map**, not in the mission.
if i left itblank is it immidetly completed

Oh. you selected a player as the destroy target? Lol, I don't think it's designed for that.
Players are super unique in that they can respawn. The destroy objective isn't designed to handle that.
well what would i do to make it work

Is it just me or do Campaigns not keep their information if you save them?
I've set the damn description 7 times now
Someone else was complaining about that

the "detected by" property is affected by EOTS right?
Yes
Detection is more or less when the unit is revealed by any sensor

But is there a max number of players on a team?
That’s the only thing I could think of
It’s co-op with 9 players

Is there a way in stable mission editor for a mp mission  to change the ah-94 skin to the desert pink used in sp training?
the desert skin is used for player aircraft that are on team B
Ok thank you 👍

@Strikeeaglechase  do you know the building name ID of the airbase hangars ? I wonder if it can manually be added in a map , editing the .vt file
I don't believe they are their own static objects, so dosn't seem like its possible
they are just regular unity mesh's on the airbase

Interestingly the tutorials are static objects...? I have no idea what they do and there's no mesh for them
what are the full name of those tut ojbect ? gonna try them 😄
``` Tut_BasicFlight Tut_GettingStarted Tut_Weapons1 VFTraining1Prefab ```

what are the full name of those tut ojbect ? gonna try them 😄
``` Tut_BasicFlight Tut_GettingStarted Tut_Weapons1 VFTraining1Prefab ```
They seem very custom so probably do nothing (or completely break) if not put in the right mission. `Tut_GettingStarted` and `VFTraining1Prefab` might do nothing at all, there's some lists that are just empty for those

Anyone have any suggestions on improving a missions command chain while making a mission?
command chain?
Who’s leading what aircraft and what these aircraft role is in the mission

Ohhh that gave me an idea, I can name the slots in the editor right?
Not yet
Unfortunately not yet

Just the numbers or the letter too?
You can change the letter (what unit group they are in)
The numbers will automatically change depending on their order in the unit group

guys how do u limit the number of aircraft used by a team?
Define limit
Do you mean like, lives?

Do you mean like, lives?
He’s making some missions with me I was in front when he asked, we mean when making a multiplayer campaign is there a way to limit the total number of lives a team has instead of just giving each aircraft a life, becuase if your are playing the campaign by yourself and we limit each aircraft to one you get 4 lives becuase there are four aircraft.
How would we go about making the lives as one life pool the team shares

Why do you need a more explicit team life pool?
becuase a game dose not always have all 4 players so if there are only 3 people playing now there is one extra life that one player gets, its not a big problem if a life pool system is not in the game i just thuaght it would be better to do it that way
> becuase a game dose not always have all 4 players so if there are only 3 people playing now there is one extra life that one player gets Right. And if you instead had a shared pool of 4 lives then it would be the same with 3 players in that only one player could respawn after death.   > its not a big problem if a life pool system is not in the game i just thuaght it would be better to do it that way It's not in the game, but it's sorta possible to implement with triggers. But I'd need to know exactly how you *want* it to function to provide an implementation.

Is there a steam workshop issue?
I uploaded my map to workshop (it shows it updated 4 mins ago) but the game isn't pulling the latest version
Yep

Hey! How do I activate one of 3 available objectives randomly?
Use a conditional action with Chance conditions.
If this objective comes in the middle of the mission, put the conditional action in a complete action for another objective.

Another question. How do I trigger a PvP victory of a specific team using an action?
victory is achieved when all required objectives are complete
Ok, thanks, that will work too.

"What if everyone is dead?"
Then E4 Overlord laughs at your sorry carcasses.
I mean unless two people splash each other on the same frame it should say one team wins

Are they part of the wrong unit group? Or do you give them any other orders such as target priority?
Nope, just spawn.
I put them as a unit group AFTER finding out they took off on spawn, to see if this fixes anything, but havnt tested it since

Hello again! How do I create a custom base not from a prefab? I want to have a small FOB for VTOL vehicles which has ATC functionality and allows rearming on the helipads. So far I could only find the Big and medium airfields as prefabs in the map editor. If I don't add those, in the mission editor my "bases" tab is empty and has no option to create one.
You can place helipads under the "static objects" tab in the mission (not map) editor. Then you can create rearm points under the units tab.
There is no way to create a FOB with ATC

I see there is a system of rewards for completing objectives. But I don't see the rewarded score on the scoreboard at the end of the mission. Is there a way to see it?
Pretty sure that reward is in currency for purchasing weapons, which only works in SP.
is there any way to turn off a radar so that an ARM might miss

any way to turn off a radar in general though?
Depends on the unit. For MAD-4 Radar, the "Set Engage Enemies" action toggles their radar.
any way to do it for an S/A?

any way to do it for an S/A?
Dunno
ok

and i'm fairly sure in real life, if you turn off one radar and turn a decoy on somewhere else, it would redirect (although i might be stupid), is that possibly modelled in vtol?
ask @Strikeeaglechase , not #mission_editor
aight sorry

I'll probably need this a number of times, do you know if I reference this conditional id in multiple events, I can reuse it?
Not too hard to copy in the VTS
Create a nearly empty condition that just checks UnitNearWaypoint 88888km so it can easily be searched for, then using text editor replace that entire conditional with a copy of the one you made previously. Just be sure to update the IDs

so it's better to check for each player in your example, can't use unit list I guess?
Nah, because this kind of check would normally be a FOR loop (which doesn't exist in VTeditor)
Does NOT ALIVE also count a player that isn't occupying that vehicle slot

The Steam Workshop issue (Having to validate files) thing isn't fixed yet is it?
it just was https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444239937152352277/1009932203536424960

It really doesn't care if they rally around E1 or E2?
I want them within 100meters of either of those specific locations, so that I, as the mapper know where they'll be when I do X
might bump the number a little higher

I might have uncovered a bug, gonna have to repro this later but...  Remember my issues  earlier with the NPC Planes and a Super Carrier?  Well how that happened was I first made the a bunch of ASF-30 planes, set them to not spawn immediately, then set them on the airfield. Cold Start, Parked.  Then I attached them to the Super Carrier, which naturally moved them onto it. Did some gameplay tests, but they were spawning and attacking too aggressively so I moved them back to the air field and put a take off command on player proximity.  Now, what I forgot to do was to remove them from the Carrier Slots, but their models still showed on the airfield. This caused a secondary issue where they simply would not spawn on either the carrier or the airfield even if I had an event to spawn them.  To fix it, I simply removed their spawns from the carrier and they worked as intended.
Is it possible to download mission editor data from steam workshop? Seems I lost my campaign editor data that uploaded in the past.
any way to to make a group of artillery bombard a waypoint or do i have to set each individually?

Nope. There's no unitgroup fire at waypoint action because a unitgroup can contain mixed ground units besides artillery.

So why is it, when I killed Bravo, Charlie doesn't spawn?
AHA!
...OR not.

Now, does anyone know if there's a way to set an infintie-respawning loop?
There are no trigger loops
Go to #vtolvrdev and ask baha to add them

In pvp the wining team is the one that compelete all its required objective, correct?
yeah in pvp strike mission
you don't necessary need to fail the other team required team objective?

you don't necessary need to fail the other team required team objective?
Correct. Either side completing all required objectives ends the mission with their team winning. Either side failing a required objective completes the mission with the other team winning.

Send your player log after trying to upload?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Force disallow for commands just means you can't control them via the comms panel IIRC

Hey! Is there a way to compare 2 global values between each other?
Not currently, but Baha expressed interest in adding the feature. https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/991424667237765310 (fixed link)
Thanks! The issue I am trying to solve. 2 teams are completing objectives. If one completes all the objectives, it wins (this is easy). There is also a mission timer. And if it expires the team which completed more objectives should win. I was thinking of implementing it with comparing global values, but since it is not yet implemented, I can do it by adding 1 to a single value if team A completes an objective and subtracting 1 if team B does. But I also want in case of equal amount of completed objectives to make that the team which completed the last objective earlier to win. This I don't know how to resolve so far.

So is there any way to not have them respond like that?
Add a "last obj" GV that gets toggled every time a team completes an objective. 1 when team A, 2 when team B If timer expires, and the GV you made previously is 0 (both teams have equal objectives), then the value of the new GV determines the winner
Since you want the earlier team to score, a value of 1 means team B wins on a tie

You know about Conditional Actions?
Yes, you've taught me a couple of days ago 🙂 I got it, thanks.
If they are part of the same unit group as the player they will automatically form up on them. So either assign them to a different group or I think you can just give them an explicit command to do something else.

Couldn’t you have just made a spawn on team a but not allow players to join team a?
is the cursor heading also the ingame heading?
or make a spawn on team A that's a cold start in the air, so they crash immediately, with a briefing that just says "you joined the wrong team"

Anyone have a good way to tell wingmen to take off at your command, but otherwise stay on deck until you tell them to?
Default behavior parked?
Nope.

Well, I come to ask a question and I already see the answer. That's sad. I've been trying to use a trigger like a procedure. Having a list of actions there which needs repeated calls in the same sequence. Any alternative solution for that?
If the mission is PvE, you can create an objective on Team B with objective start actions for what you want to do, and also an action to cancel itself. Every time you want to run those actions start the objective.
My mission is PvP.

Ok, I'll try to think of something. And another question. Can I somehow make both teams lose? When I fail their main objectives in 2 consecutive actions, the second one always wins, since the first team fails the objective earlier.
nope
one team losing also causes the other team to win

Sequence can also run only once, right?
yes
Well, I've tried your first suggestion with a fake objective which gets cancelled, but in the same team. It's not too bad, since the end of my "procedure" actually results in a new objective, so the player does not see the message about the fake objective. Thanks! Should be good enough.

i figured this is probably the place to ask where can i find the stock in game missions like the desert cobra Champaign ?
They aren't normally available to edit, but can be extracted from the game files and converted to CustomScenarios with the right tools and knowledge.
Why do you need them? Someone just converted Desert Cobra to F-45 if that's what you're looking for. https://old.reddit.com/r/vtolvr/comments/wwl2ir/operation_desert_cobra_for_the_f45a/

Is there some documentation that exists somewhere on how the multiplayer editor differs from the singleplayer editor and what is/isn't feasible?
Everything but player spawns and vehicle control blocks in the conditional editor work
that's about all there is to it

Is there like mission editor documentation at all? I've just been kind of messing around trying to figure out how things work and watched a couple videos.
@Sypwn I just want to say that I absolutely adore the Quick version of Dynamic Liberation, it's practically the only mission I host in public lobbies lately. It's great! Really renewed my fun for VTOL VR almost by itself.
Specifically I would like to know how to get ground units to actually follow roads instead of just running through them as though they don't exist.

should I be using railpath or normal path?
normal path
railpath is old code left over in the game

Hey! How do I play a radio message once after a player enters a vehicle for the first time on a server?

I never get pitbulled and get the normal SARH cues from the targeting radar
get a video of it and report it in #public_testing if you find it is an actual issue lol

It totally is - posted over there.  Could just be my mission's fucked, I guess?
I really hate this, if you have some kind of error, in the code, it leaves a bunch of stuff blank on the editor, if you then accidenally save it, you lose everything
I think I just lost all my objectives, and events, I don't know if there's a way to recover

How hard would it be the yoink the radar math from the game to create a little interactive calculator to find the detection distances for a specified craft and specified radar?

I already sorta made something like that

How's something like this for a mockup? You just have dropdowns for planes and radars, type the relative altitude, then it fills in the boxes on the left

question are the steam workshop campaigns stored anywhere?

Good morning.  I have a question for anyone who knows the editor pretty well.  I'm currently trying to teach myself how to use it, and I'm having difficulty with one particular issue.  I'm trying to find a way to send a list of GPS waypoints to all players of a multiplayer mission that stays available after death (or can be refreshed after death).  So far: - A proximity trigger at the MP spawns to send GPS waypoints doesn't seem to refresh on death.  (I'm assuming this can only fire once.  I don't know how to change that.) - An objective that sends the GPS waypoints as a start event doesn't seem to send them at all. I've tried slight variations of both of these, but I haven't gotten it to work yet.  If anyone knows what I'm missing here, please let me know.  Thanks.

`GPS waypoints as a start event doesn't seem to send them at all.`  is it at the start of the mission?
Trigger can only fire once unfortunately
Good to know.

To be clear, you mean for triggering the objective?
If it trigger the gps event on activation and if the objective start immediatly on mission start, yes
Okay, great.  You might have just fixed my issue, because I never thought of that.  Thanks!  I'll try it tonight.

So a second should be enough to get around the latency?
on mission start I think so
if a player would take more than 1 sec from Lobby > start > ingame, he would be screwed tho

Would this still work for people joining late?
which is apparently the golden number for Live TV delay 😄
unfortunately no

how many pepole can be on one team?
up to 16 players in a lobby, and you can split it between the teams however you want (including 16-0)
thx

Happy to announce that my map is in Closed Beta, content is done, doing closed beta testing this weekend for performance tests and (hopefully) no bugs 🙂

is there a way to download campaigns that people have posted on the workshop in order to view how they work in the mission editor?
Afaik you would need to contact the original mission creator to get the original mission files, but I could be wrong
ok

in standalone missions, you can force a player's plane to break as an action in an event. I cant seem to find this option in the multiplayer campaign. Does anyone know where it is or how to do something similar?
Currently not possible in MP.
(I don't understand why)

im trying to prevent peopl from going above a certain altitude, how else could i do that without affecting the whole team?
Nothing clean
im just going to have to set up loads of SEAD arent I

Would that borkenness also include "within radius" triggers?
no those work fine
I am bad at conditional events confirmed 😦

then only afterward while loop is effective?
does the player spawn inside the zone?
nope

does the player spawn inside the zone?
nope
outside, drives inside

So then that means a While loop that has fired, then gone false, cannot be reactivated at any time? Say I wanted to make a wave event.
or a ...I dunno King of the Hill Event
players fighting over a zone

This one’s for the rising storm 2 fans. Just finished testing on my first legit mission/map and I wanted to share; any feedback would most certainly be appreciated. If I can get my hands on some nam mods or rpg wielding custom units I’d be keen to make a mod+ or mp version.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2857112524
Unfortunately the ai pathing does not seem to handle the valley well. It’s a cointoss whether the fa-26 and av-42 will actually land/bomb or just fly into a hill trying. Sometimes the fa-26 will go for bombing runs and fly over/drop flares but not actually drop bombs as well, although I’m not sure if that’s something I’m causing.
hey fellas, do you know what's involved in fulfilling the landing condition in the condition editor? is it coming to a complete stop or will it count as landing if you've touched down and you're moving at <50knots?

iirc its less than 40knots but idk
alright, thanks!

What exactly does stayinradius do on unit tools tab? Assume it let's the unit free roam in a specified area - and if so how do you define the radius? Thanks.
They'll continually go towards a DEFAULT WAYPOINT and never stop unless destroyed or told to do something else. They'll keep making short little "donuts" towards the waypoint, drive past, turn back towards the waypoint and try again in a small radius.
if you have the unit in a unit group, then it won't go to that waypoint unless the unit group is given the MOVE TO command

and why cant i select my costom cenarios?
you need to sub to it on the steam workshop
ok

and if i want choices?

how do I make good missions?
😭
Make a mission that you would want to play yourself. If you enjoy testing it, then others will enjoy playing it

.. good missions? First make a mission, then make it harder until you cannot win alone, then add a player and move to public testing, then make it harder again, add player, rinse and repeat until the mission grows legs , and if nobody picks it up and plays it ...  start over from scratch !   After just a few you will start to make great missions !! Good Luck

Hi - been away for a while.  Has recurring / looping events been added yet - eg  if x enters y trigger  z event but it remains active unless deactivated so will trigger  multiple times. Or has there been any update /indication if it may be added in near future updates?
Literally last week. It's in public_testing
That's great news - thank you. Will just have to wait until its pushed to stable for the mission I'm working on - but I'll try it in public 👍

I cant seem to find this in a search. Will setting alt spawns for a player craft allow them to choose where they spawn?
No. The only way to do that is to create separate MP slots at each location.
Noted. Was hoping it would work similar to how the Heli works in DynLib. Thanks anyways!

But you have to tie it to a specific event, correct? Is that the same as in the chopper or if I set multiple spawns will it give an option for that airframe?
Not exactly sure what you're asking but  > Is that the same as in the chopper Spawn points behave the same regardless of what kind of aircraft it is. Dyn Lib only moving the chopper spawns was a mission design choice, not a game limitation.  > if I set multiple spawns will it give an option for that airframe? There is no way to present a spawn location option to players, beyond their choice of which aircraft slot to select in the lobby
I see. I may have misunderstood when a pilot told me he could select an airbase spawn, but what he probably meant was "once airbase is captured helis will spawn there instead of on Mom."
 Great work on DynLib btw

Yes. There is an Event Sequence dedicated to moving the chopper spawn points at the appropriate times.

Yeah would be nice to be able to set speeds and have it slow down on landing requests etc. I'm sure this is probably asked often, but is there any known plan to expand the editors capabilities?
Nothing on changing fleet speeds, but trigger looping and AI unit respawning was just finally added last week. It's in the public_testing branch right now.  My editor wishlist thread is here: https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/962116934730678332
and one of my posts there does include a request for naval unit speed options

Is there any way to set up a hard ceiling for a multiplayer mission?
I’m currently using invincible Sam sites to enforce one
There is now in the public_testing branch. You can make a looping trigger that watches for players to reach a certain altitude, then action kill them.

The ability to kill players via a trigger is coming in this next update too?
yes
Although the dev has mentioned he would prefer you kill players naturally when possible instead instead of trigger killing. For example, @Indybin using trigger looping you can make those SAMs ignore targets unless they go above a certain altitude.

Anyone know how to mimic freeflight when it comes to objectives?
I thought freeflight has no objective
well the campaign I'm working on has no objectives, but whenever I spawn in to test it the mission finishes and I can't just respawn back in when I die

I'm confused as I haven't changed anything in that area really and the last campaign I made didn't have this issue
no it's multiplayer

Just set the mpspawn to be on the carrier deck in its settings?
i know I can do that but I want to be able to move the spawn
guess only one way to find out

Generally I would use the move spawn action to move the spawn but ig if it doesn’t work well for spawning on carriers?
You can set the player spawn point to any airfield and then edit your carrier and assign the deck locations to your players. You will then spawn on the carrier instead of the airfield however you can re-arm at that airfield in game.
This just points players to where they spawned when they press the RTB button on their NAV page. you'll have to use move spawn triggers or alt spawns to move player's spawn points around

Do you guys know if the kill player command and respawnig units is coming soon to the main branch?

Hey guys, my First Time in the Mission Editor (I'm very used to the DCS Mission Editor^^). Do I need to set which plane the player gets?   Also I can't figure out how to give the F/A-26 the IRIS-T Missile (Or AIRS-T ingame??). Only the AIM-9s and AMRAAMs show up.
are mad-4's SARH?
yes, but there is a MAD-4A variant which is active

Ok, where do I find the Player vehicle tho? Can't see it in "new unit"
here in multi
unsure about single

Yeah, got that now. Now I've got that weird Green plane. How do I set  that to the other planes?
How does that become the F/A-26 e.g.
should be in the unit settings

Or do i just spawn another plane right above it?
Hmmm
I don't see all of that

is there a particular unit limit?
Nope
Dynamic liberation I believe has over a thousand units

I have tried editing the .VTS file directly because I need to copy/paste a lot of functions (triggers only work once), but it did not take my edits once saved. Is it even possible to edit the .VTS file directly?

is there a way to make infantry units board the closes AV-42C?
can i get to the mission editor without going into vr first?
yes

can i get to the mission editor without going into vr first?
yes
you can launch the game without the headset, and in the bottom right corner you'll see the editors

do the event triggers keep checking even after they've been triggered? or just once
Currently looping triggers are available on PTB, as a sequence event
Player or AI?

Both? Would be great if I could have players do pickups instead of the AI, but have it pick up the slack when the players don't do it
For AI, it’s an action on the infantry units to board the AV-42C. Same to disembark
For player, pickup/drop off objectives will automatically have them board your plane

Another small issue i have been having is when I try to test the scenario and launch it in the editor.  The mission fails to load in VR. Is there a specific order I should open missions in the editor/oculus/steamVR, that I need? (I usually have them all closed) I'll put the headset on an only see my monitors.
No. VR should work fine when launched from the editor. Please post your log.

In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

What headset do you have? Does VR work normally before you enter the editor?
I have the oculus quest. I open in in VR, but when I click to the editor it switches to desktop and the headset comes off. I have the issue after that. When I put the headset back on it shows my monitors in 2d VR mode. I'll check about the log.
It's normal for the editor to only show on the monitor. But the VR should return as soon as you exit the editor back to the menu, or when you start testing a mission. (The helmet room should be in VR)

could I just have a single waypoint to act as a battle locus of sorts?
the naval fleets move towards the waypoint, and all associated aircraft orbit around it
I think what you're describing is basically just patrol paths

Hey all another question I couldnt find an answer for. I want to drop off troops on a carrier. I saw some chat in here saying it needed to be a static object in order for it to work but the only static object for sea in the editor is an oil platform. any suggestions?
I think they mean it has to be not moving. I haven't messed with dropping off troops myself, but theoretically as long as it's stopped in a known location, you can put a waypoint there as a dropoff destination.
hmm ok, I set a waypoint but it just kind of hovers. it doesnt set itself on the carrier so i didnt know if it would trigger the drop off. Ill try that and see what happens

If you don't check the allow reloads on a mad4 / Sam launcher does it just fire at random intervals rather than a set reload time. I've had Sam lnr  fire repeated times without the allow reload box being checked?
Afaik each launcher has a number of missiles available for it to fire, kind of like a magazine. Allow reload just lets it refill that magazine after a period of time once fully depleted
Thanks Smol 👍

I am looking for some help on how to start with GPS coordinates in the GPS system for target groups in the aircraft. Can someone walk me through how I would set that up in the mission editor to start the mission with these GPS targets already in the aircraft?
singleplayer or multiplayer mission?
Multiplayer mission

Hmmm it shouldn't be aircraft dependent right?
Are you creating them right at the start of the mission? I put it on a 3 sec delay from mission start to ensure the aircraft has loaded in.
It won't affect players who aren't fully loaded in their aircraft when it triggers.

I will try the event delay, there wasn't one so that could be the problem

I'm trying to play a custom map but I need to make a mission, how do I quickly make a free flight mission?
Uhhhh... create a singleplayer mission, select your map, add a player spawn point, save, then launch a test run
Yeah but I'm trying to fly a jet, not use a helicopter

can i test a multiplayer mission in multiplayer without uploading it first?
As much as I know, No.
You can upload and immediately change it to ~~hidden~~ unlisted or friends only through steam

can you change the order of listed missions in a campaign?
Yes, Maravrin, you can click and drag the missions to whatever order you like. 🙂
lol THanks

Is there an easy way to get a "high quality" Image of a map your using for briefing purposes?
I use the minimap tool in the mission editor
interesting Ill give that a try. Thanks Sypwn... Eagle Dynamics should pay you for the amount of help you give

Wondering if anyone else has had this problem? Whenever I try to reset the player vehicle I can't type a heading, speed, or fade time. Every time I enter a number it just sets it to 0.
Odd
try restarting the game?

Is there any other way to reset the player to another spot?
Is this a singleplayer mission?
Yes

Is this a singleplayer mission?
Yes
I didn't even know "resetting" a player was an option. In SP, once the player dies, the mission fails.

Maybe wait for the player to return to a waypoint after each wave?
Or you could make it an MP mission and have the player eject to reset.
It can be an MP mission with only one slot.

Are we talking about a player? Or an AI unit?
A player
But only send it to the player that entered it

How do I get the drone carrier to use its drones offensively?
I'm trying to make the ship engage an allied cruiser, to send out its drones to attack it
hopefully from beyond the cruisers anti ship missile range

can someone help me with having AI taxi and takeoff using paths?
The AI will taxi/takeoff themselves, you just command them to takeoff
You don't manually create the paths for em

not even for AWACs and tankers?
Yep all AI aircraft will taxi on their own
thank you

@Strikeeaglechase how would you make an AI (in my case a B-11 Bomber) bomb a certain area?
use the Bomb Waypoint event action
Ok good Sypwn is here, I have no idea lmao

Hey guys, anyone know what the mission completion conditions are for some of the SP free flight and carrier practice missions ? I want to have the 100% completion rating but I can't finish those missions as teh objective page on the MFD states no objective

Does the current or PT mission editor have a way to detect and codify number of players that are in a game?  I have another way to do it, but I was hoping for something more streamlined.

UnitList (check all players) number alive greater/less than...
It will count players that are alive and spawned in

That actually begs the question how it looks at ALL type conditionals.  I know with AI it considered both spawned and unspawned units.        Example: group alpha is 4 player mp spawns. I have the conditional event: trueIF(ALL(Group_Alpha)=near_wpt).   If I only have only 3 players, would it be able to print true if the 3 players meet the conditional?
Lol nvm, even if it works the same as AI, I can still make a conditional flow that considers all options.
For ALL conditionals, it looks at all units regardless of alive or dead. So for `ALL (players) Near Waypoint` to be fulfilled, all player slots would have to be occupied and spawned in.

hey fellas, do lots of road being placed in a map have a significant impact on performance/frame rate in missions?
Not much, but I'm sure if you stack enough in a small area they will. L'etranger has built entire structures out of roads.
Cool, then I doubt what i'm up to will affect performance too much

Hi i started 3 days ago with the editor. I got tanks running into buildings. Path is set in linear but still they do continue. How ca.n i solve this? Also what are all the other path options like follow and Railpath? Whats thw difference there?
IIRC Railpath is something leftover and shouldn't be used, and units don't care about your placed buildings they just drive through everything no way around that but moving the paths themselves
Hey is there any reason that when I try to upload my mission to Steam Workshop I get "Error: Limit Exceeded". Has this ever happened to anybody?

Hey is there any reason that when I try to upload my mission to Steam Workshop I get "Error: Limit Exceeded". Has this ever happened to anybody?
The answer is that your mission/campaign's primary image is larger than 1MB
Thanks @Sypwn , I found that if I used a smaller image but tried uploading from within the mission editor it wouldn't change. You have to edit from within the campaign editor for anybody who gets the "Error: Limit Exceeded" and doesn't find a fix in the future.

Maybe define an exit condition as 'MP_Spawn 5' IS NOT locking target 'ON'. Wont the trigger hang indefinitely waiting for an exit condition to 'end' the sequence?
When you talk about "turning on" and "turning off" the respawning of the tank, are you stopping and starting any sequences? Or are you only toggling the value of that GV?
Also, the respawner sequence should have an exit condition of waiting for the tank to be dead. Otherwise it will run every second trying to spawn the tank over and over even when it's still alive, which will spam your player log.

I am solely just changing the GV, figured it would work just with that. Should I also stop and start the event as well?

No, I was just making sure. Next step would be to search for sequence entries in the player log
Was gonna do this

Hey, how do I use this thing?
Uhh you'll need nodejs installed, maybe ill setup a simple website to convert easier
@ISEGaming if you can create a test mission that recreates the logic you're having trouble with, then zip that up and upload it, that would be very helpful.

@Sypwn what sort of validation would be useful? First thing I thought of was checking `unitInstanceID` to make sure all IDs are unique
Validation on what?
VTS file

Oh, lol. If you wanted to make a tool to assist mission creators in doing things that are tedious in the VTEdit, that would be awesome. Validation, copying/moving actions and conditionals, reassigning conditionals, etc. But for a VTS-JSON converter? It's not as important.  If you want to have it validate as many IDs as you can, that would be cool. Unit instances, conditionals, conditional action blocks.
> that would be awesome Issue is thats all UI heavy
which I suck at lmao

Could you send me a vts file with such errors so I can test?
Tomorrow. I'm too tired to think now
I just so happen to be a front-end web developer, and I often make my own UI's, so I can help ya there 🙂

So you mean a unique numerical value used for referencing? Yes
And again, there are over a dozen different types of IDs in a VTS file. Units, waypoints, objectives, paths, bases, static objects, timed events, conditional events, event sequences, conditions, conditional actions nodes, global values...
some have useful unique names like `unitInstanceID`, but most just say `id`

what would you need from me if I made a very basic front-end?
I could do it myself if I had the motivation. I just haven't had a real need, and the fact that I have to completely quit and relaunch the game to load changes from disk means it would be a real hassle to use regardless.
prolly just gonna make a intex.html file with some css

like sort all (Unit/objectives/etc) Alpha?
thanks for the info Neo.
hello. My editor seems not to save the image and description in the Mp mission editor.  Am i doing something wrong? Also on steam it does jot show an image unless you actually click on the link to the map in the workshop. Hope someone can give me a clue on solving that. Thanks

nope, its very annoying
sometimes reloading the game seems to fix it? (after you assign the image and description)

report it as a bug
strange. It makes it at every time i use the editor. Thanks anyhow for the quick reply.

im trying to make a mp "campaign"(its just one mission) but i cna only place one spawn point and even when its placed it still says theres an error  any help?
I'm assuming you've selected the Multiplayer option, so I'd assume that maybe you put down a SP spawn point and forgot to delete it? Other than that, I'm not sure.
i can only place sp spawn point and i DID make it an mp campaign so unless i am missing something and cant find the mp spawn points i dont know what to say

did you check the mp check box?
yes
I think I've seen this before. Someone else once uploaded a sp mission inside an mp campaign and it broke everything. Would you be willing to zip up the campaign and pm it to me?

i can try
thats if i can find the folder again

You sent me a normal standalone singleplayer mission. You sure this was in your campaigns folder?
It doesn't show up ingame for me if I put it in my Campaigns folder
THERE IS NO CAMAIGN FOLDER

I agree ... wut ?
uh idk just send an image of what you have it set up as
pick up objective, set ur conditions then select the troops u pickup

Can you post a screenshot here?
i wa bouta say
havent even lost my nitro yet and people are already ignoring my existence again -_-

These are the options offered ?
and there arent any other missions yet
Yup

Before I get them to load ?
no
can u get vc?

any of that not make sense at all?
Thanks ... now lets see how much I absorbed  .. ha ! I will check back L8r
yes it was good

What if you put them under tabs listed across the top of the screen?
Because my units list is like 700 units long
Is this an external mission editor?

Is this an external mission editor?
Yeah was gonna do that next, just showing some WIP.
Sorry, shoulda started with a 👍

I have a question... are unspawned AI aircraft considered not alive in the conditional editor?
they are alive until destroyed
Ay thanks

ok so @Strikeeaglechase @Sypwn anything else I should add to the UI? or are you ready to to receive the files @Strikeeaglechase
I just realized you guys are doing the lords work

Is there anyway to detect when the player ejects?
You can check if the player is dead, but I don't think you can see if they ejected afterwards.

Is there anyway to detect when the player ejects?
You can check if the player is dead, but I don't think you can see if they ejected afterwards.
Only with single player maps if you use the conditionals to check if the player uses the ejection handle.

What are you more generally trying to do?
Just trigger an event when the player either dies or ejects. It’s easy to do on player death but I’m trying to figure out how to trigger it on an ejection as well since dying from a missile is rare
And also have it triggered before the player respawns

hey guys I'm trying my hand at making a mission, I used to make broodwar maps so I'm fairly savvy,  but if there was a website or wiki I can look at and how to make the map a multiplayer app?
"map not app
Ejection counts as death.

Hi, How to a change all the MP spawn points in the MP mission? I want to change the spawn points from the starting missions airport to an airport that has been taken over. The spawn points for each players should then be there permanent.  Thanks in advance for the help.
There is an event to change the spawn. But you have to set an alt spawn in the unit editor
Great. found it. Thanks !!!!!!!👍

Is there a way to adjust the volume of custom audio files in the mission editor? Because the voice lines and stuff im using are all easily 3 times louder than ingame voicelines when I launch the missions...
Not through the editor. Just fix them using Audacity
I see. so I need to use third party means then... thats a shame and extremely tedious, given its over 20 files.

thanks for the help yesterday guys.  I'm playing with the map editor running a "capture " the bases map. ie have 5 airports on a map, and teams can take over/retake 3 of airfields. once a team has 4 airfields the game is over   Is this something the editor can handle? I know it can do single take overs, plenty of maps have this feature already, but can it change sides multiple times?  another question would be respawning the base defenses everytime it changes sides, is this also possible?
just before I go to far making placeables for something unachievable
Both of these (recapturable bases and respawning units) are possible but only in the new VTOL version 1.5 in public_testing. People are already starting to build MOBAs and stuff.

Quick question related to separated briefings; other than checking separated briefings in the editor is there anything else preventing the host from choosing the room type?  I have separate rooms unchecked in the editor and it’s false in the vts file, but it won’t let me chose the room when launching from the editor or hosting privately on the ptb
I believe if there are too many player slots you are forced to use the large combined
Since the separate briefing rooms supports only 12 people (6 per team) I believe

quick question: is there a way to count the player's kills?  I want a certain voice line to play after the player shot down 2 or 3 enemies, but i cant figure that out.  I can make voice lines play if certain enemies are shot down in general by anyone, but not the player specifically.  basically... how do I detect if the player made the kill, and not one of the npc's?

In an MP mission you can track how many kills the players together have gotten by using the score feature. But I don't think there is a way to detect which unit or player got a single kill.
ah, I see...  since its a single player mission, I guess Im... probably gonna have to see about being creative some other way.  though, good point on the score feature via multiplayer... maybe I can convert the map to be multiplayer capable, while still using that feature... hmm...

Have you tried clicking Tools -> Re-pack map?
I've never seen that specific error, but repacking the map might help.

```validating campaign scenario hawaiattack - mapID: Hawaii_1764918363 Unable to locate map: Hawaii_1764918363 hawaiattack: Map must be packed!``` Something is wrong with the map for this mission. Did you create it yourself? Or did you use one from the workshop?
I used one from the workshop
Hmm. I haven't done that myself yet.

Do you think I should try to remake the mission on a different map?
If you can wait a day or two, I can try to experiment with workshop maps and see if it's a limitation.
ok thx I think I will work on another map for now

Why did this ping *me?*
Am I a moderator now?
lmao

I haven't been able to reproduce your error. Campaigns containing workshop maps seem pretty resilient.

@Strikeeaglechase @Sypwn following up, anything else needed on this UI? I'd like to get this thing rolling.
probably should have a separate thread for it
I extremely rarely use the editor so I cannot comment

Does the "Sort IDs" tab let you drag and drop the units around?
But I thought you would be the one implementing the thing
yes

Alhough it might be faster in this app. thoughts?
Bulk rename, maybe. But I wouldn't bother with features that exist in the editor.
Bulk rename would be nice, not sure how to go about doing that, other than a search and replace

of whats currently being dragged?
yeah
kk

i think i know the answer but just to be sure, let's say someone hipotheticaly had to format it's pc and forgot to backup the editors custom missions.. its there a way to retrieve them ?

On average how long does it take for a ship to fully sink in game?
And if an infantry goes underwater do they immediately die as well?
They half sink, then stay there for a while, then eventually despawn I think? Not sure on the timing.

erm... ok, just a precautionary question, but if I've published a scenario... and I lost the custom scenario files... how exactly could you get those files back? or is that scenario now just... dead and non-updatable?  havent happened to me, but im just curious.
There's not *really* a way
just backup your mission files always

To be honest though, im useless at scripting (if I wanna do it myself)... but Im still curious regardless, lol. How would a script help recover the files? I know you can get the custom scenario and custom map files in steam's workshop folders, but yeah... thats about it
> How would a script help recover the files? The files on the workshop are basically encrypted, the script undoes that
After that your left with just a regular mission that you can edit

I have just found out about this feature for Visual Studio Code? SliptUp, SplitDown, SplitLeft, SplitRight
That`s before you load the File You can have different files open on one window without using the Tab above to choose the file to look for.
What does this have to do with the mission editor?

You will see in 1 minuet
So if you look at the text file names I can have all open in one windows so in the Image belows I could have a Mission Todo list this could inclused OBjectives and how many units per Enemy or Allied

How do I exit mission testing? Is there anyway to force end the mission and go back to the editor?
Nevermind. You just have to press Delete
is it possible to open steam workshop missions in the editor?

is it possible to open steam workshop missions in the editor?
Only if they are your own
ah that's a shame]

I would assume so. You could probably run a test for that with tutorial messages.    I never used the initial delay thing because I can just.. you know, add? If I want the actions to delay after the event is triggered, I just add that to the time delay of each action.
In the editor when you put in for example like 300 for something like a trigger, it’s 300 meters right? It’s not like unreal engine where every unit is actually like like 2 centimeters or some bs?
yeah editor is almost entirely in meters

yeah editor is almost entirely in meters
There's a measuring tool in one of the top menus.

is there an opfor tanker for refueling?
Doesn't seem to be.
damn

I have also noticed if you change the Delay for each event they move out of order not sure if you have seen or noticed this?
For example if you where to change there delay to 600s = 10 mins or 300s = 5 mins
Are you referring to timed events?

Are you referring to timed events?
In a timed event group, the specified delay for each node is relative to the start of the event (after the initial delay). So for a timed event group like this:
```T+0   - Mission start (nothing happens) T+120 - GAV-25 spawns in T+150 - GAV-25 takes off T+180 - GAV-25 moves to attack player```

So if you and another player would play you both would have to complete objectives related to your Mission if one player has completed all objectives but not Return to carrier Objective then the hole mission fails and the 2nd player can no longer complete the Scenario Missions?
For testing how ever I let AI take out Golf then I will take to the air with my wingmen to take out India Enemy`s this will not be available in the Steam workshop update release both players must spawn in.
even if you spawn in on your own you would have to wait for Either Bravo Player or Sierra Player to spawn depending what unit you chose.

So How I want it to work is Only Bravo Mission Objectives will be visible ok obj screen of the aircraft when they all completed there mission there mission trigger would Stop and Sierra Mission would Start then all of Bravo Objectives are not showing only Sierra Objectives are showing?
> So How I want it to work is Only Bravo Mission Objectives will be visible ok obj screen of the aircraft when they all completed there mission there mission trigger would Stop and Sierra Mission would Start then all of Bravo Objectives are not showing only Sierra Objectives are showing?  I can't decipher this sentence. Is it missing punctuation?
As when I have tested instead of it saying Bravo Takeoff , Bravo Defeat Enemy Golf, I notice that the only objective that shows is Sierra Defeat India

Obj is short for Objectives on the aircraft main screen with all opstions

```mips so what if I dont want any Objectives or missions to start until the timed event is over? ```
Then you set `Start Mode: Triggered` and use triggers to activate them with the timer.
are conditions still relevant or only used for like combat in the air, So for example Golf is num allive = 0, then Objective Bravo Return, but cancels all other objectives that are no long needed as all enemy aircraft are dead.

Or how does the Objectives get completed?
I have never gone into detail before
> are conditions still relevant or only used for like combat in the air Yes, for objectives that do not fit into the standard objective types.  > So for example Golf is num allive = 0 That sounds like a Destroy objective would work, but you can still use a conditional if you prefer.  > then Objective Bravo Return Then *what* Objective Bravo Return? I think you're missing a verb?  > but cancels all other objectives that are no long needed as all enemy aircraft are dead. I know you tried to explain your mission earlier, but it takes me too much effort to decipher your writing. You can make the completion of one objective complete the others, or cancel them. If you cancel other objectives then they can't be used for prerequisite objectives, as they have to be completed to count toward the prerequisite.

Ok what would you call Military Time?
What?
Anyway we are off topic

So I the images I have added Do I still need to add the Objectives to Sequence Event or no?
I am sort of confused about this as I have set the events in the Objectives themselves.
You can set the events in the objektive and only trigger the objektive in the first node.  Second node seems to be conditional so I would not touch it.

1. Place players and friendly units. 2. Place enemies to kill. 3. Create objective to destroy enemy units. 4. Profit?
Also, <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor>
is it possible to create an objective for locating something

have you clicked on the success condition in the editor?
i've just been reading the wiki page
and related crosslinks on the page that say mission editor/dsfahjkf

so things are going well, I have the spawn groups set up to push unit spawns to newly owned / fall back posiitonds depending on objectives etc. but for some reason all the planes are ignoring alt spawn 1 for default and starting on 2 any ideas?
I'm makign a tug of war style map for PVP with PVE components. Each team has 3 air bases and as you loose one your spawns are pushed back to the next one. Or forward to the next. It seems to work fine other than the starting locations are being ignored in favor for spawn 2 at start.
What probability is alt spawn 2 set to?

What probability is alt spawn 2 set to?
90
1-4 is 100/90/80/70

and its only using alt-spawn 2?
yeah without fail
even though it has 4 configured?

even though it has 4 configured?
do you have *any* `force alt spawn` triggers?
A ton, but they don't com into play until either the timer after spawn (2 minutes) or a base is destroyed

do you have *any* `force alt spawn` triggers?
A ton, but they don't com into play until either the timer after spawn (2 minutes) or a base is destroyed
I can tell that it's choose 2 even in the lobby because I set each spawn locaiton to have a different number of available lives

I don't think the triggers can start until the host hits start match right?
oh, these are *players* with alt-spawns?
yea

oh, these are *players* with alt-spawns?
yea
I could try putting the probability of the other spawns to like 1

I am a little confused and hoping someone could help clear up my confusion. How do I design a multiplayer mission? The game officially supports multiplayer now but I can't find an option to make missions multiplayer. Am I missing something?
I try to add a second spawn point and it tells me I cannot do that.
You need to create a new Campaign. There you can toggle on multiplayer.

Oh, can't make single missions (custom scenarios) multiplayer?
You can have a single mission in a campaign
right of course, but was in custom scenario design mode

is there a way to use said map in making a new mission?
you can use it in a mission, but you can't edit it
is there a way to use a map that was used in a seperate mission? im trying to use the nyc map in a different mission

is there a way to use a map that was used in a seperate mission? im trying to use the nyc map in a different mission
Not officially
well damn, looks like ima have to try and remake it myself

Is this your first mission?
You could also ask the creator of that map if they are willing to share it.
no ive made a couple of missions before but they were all very quick'

I know the max player limit for a server is 16, but can you have more slots for players than that in the mission? I'm trying to do something with multiple spawns for different airbases around the map
Yeah, you can have as many player spawn slots as you want.
If you edit the .vts, you can make their starting lives 0 so they can only be used after progressing in the mission

have you had it to where on the enemy's screen they the "mission failed" after destroying a target, but it having not been the actual end of the mission? but their waypoints on the team that received it no longer have objectives, and everyone can spawn in and out normally as if the misison still is live?
nope
well glad to be breaking new ground haha

does anyone know why this is happening?
What are the targets?
players

should something like this work?
yes
Wait, maybe

so should i do total score?
yes
and in the mission options you set how many points kills and deaths are worth

what if i have like 200 NPCs also on the field?
oh, not sure
and i just want to count player deaths

Is that in an experimental branch?
yeah, #public_testing
it will probably be there for a while

Oh and one last thing. Does this count deaths as points for the enemy? Or for the team that its set to.
Because if this is right, that could mean i could count it as if killing NPCs doesnt give points but killing players does
deaths credit points to the opposing team

We are talking about the MP Stats conditions, right? I think it looks at the scoreboard and counts all the listed deaths on that team. So it won't count players that haven't spawned, but I also don't think it will count players that have died then quit the lobby.
alright, thanks for the help
If I have an AI aircraft (F-45A in this case) start cold, and I tell it to vertical take off, how long will it take to get running?

Also, if I command a sea group to move to a waypoint, will they move in formation or collide into each other?
i am once again doing stuff in the editor and i have run into a peculiar problem I have two objectives that both have a 50% chance of beginning. Plan is to have an RTB objective that comes after the completion of the 2 new objectives.  However, because both have a 50% chance of starting in the fist place, how do i make it so that you either have to complete the triggered mission/ both missions/ or just start the rtb objective if neither of the two have triggered?

(not a mission maker), maybe make it so that the RTB only requires 50% off all objectives to be completed?

Convoy 1 is started directly after reaching the waypoint and after it has been completed, Convoy 2 and Escort both have a 50% chance of happening after Con 1

@Sypwn sorry to ping ya, but would you perhaps happen to know how to go about this?
anyone?
One sec

is that last image from a seperate conditional event? The current Trigger for the convoy and Escort are the ones that decide wether or not to spawn them
The last image is whatever conditional checks if RTB should start
(wrong reply, whoops)

so this means that RTB begins as soon as either Obj 1/2 reach Value 2?
in theory this should be able to work now
Alternative method

dumb question, but how do i get to that if else editor?
the fact that i've never managed to spot it confuses me greatly
That's a conditional action. How else are you rolling objectives using chance??

That's a conditional action. How else are you rolling objectives using chance??
are you perhaps avaiable to discuss this in VC1 or something, im still a bit confused
i've tried to do the 2nd method

so as i understand it, is this trigger completely irrelevant now?
and the 50 Roll begins with the completion of the first destruction objective
leaving me in the end with the RTB condition that is triggered once the aforementioned objectives have reached Value 0

how does one go about making said sequencial event?
Events -> Event Sequences -> New Or something like that. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor/Events#Sequence>
everything seems to mostly be in working order now, so finishing up that event and polishing a few rough edges and the mission should be complete

My first custom multiplayer map & scenario! Tug of War - 8v8. PVP & PVE:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2869741013&searchtext=  I worked all weekend on this and I'm pretty proud of it.  A chain of islands where 2 teams fight over control of a total of 6 bases. Kind of like a MOBA were each base has to be taken before the next one.  Offence base Oscar > Defence Base Delta > Home.  Both sides have identical, symmetrical logic programmed into their mission objectives. So both sides have an equal opportunity.  When Oscar is destroyed it starts a chain of other objectives for both teams, the team winning gets a ground sneak attack on their offensive base they have to go back to handle, and the team that lost their offensive base gets the opportunity to complete an objective to launch their navy and carrier fleet.   Taking of the first base allows the team that won that enagement to spawn at the newly taken base, but if their offensive base gets captured they no longer can spawn there. etc.    There are other objectives that happen when triggered like a bomber squadron launching, extra lives per base capture that add up, etc.  Feedback is appreciated. I think I've worked out all the bugs.
Does this need VTOL v1.5?
is this good?

I dunno, I played it Sunday morning. I assume everyone was on the same version due to steam updates?

I dunno, I played it Sunday morning. I assume everyone was on the same version due to steam updates?
1.5 is the version in public_testing that supports looping triggers and respawning units. Impressive to make a tug of war map without these.
No. Conditional actions only fire once, instantly when they are activated. If you want the sequence to __wait__ for something to happen, then you have to put that condition in an entry or exit condition.

Question, i'm working on an even trigger that tells people to stay below 1000ft ASL. once it triggers though thats it, it won't trigger again if they fly below and then go back up. Any way to re-set the trigger so it can be used again and again? I tried set event = enable on a seprate timed event to re-enable the first one but that didnt' seem to help
Once a trigger is triggered, it can't be activated again
As Shadow stated, triggers can't be reactivated or looped.  ...unless you are using the new public_testing branch. VTOL v1.5 finally adds looping trigger support so you can do exactly what you want with a looping event sequence.

okay feeling dumb, where do I put breifing room MP3's ? hah
I tried putting them where the breifing room image is but no luck finding it in editor
EditorResources, same place as the images

Is it possible to edit a map used on a mission WITHOUT breaking the mission?
i made a mission and after bringing it into multiplayer everyone said it was one sided, so i need to add some cover
yeah, that's what repack does

So I have been playing with number of units and want to get an idea of how many total active units you all use in your missions? I try to keep mine in between 80 to 100 for performance reasons. My system can handle more but other players cannot come to find out. Curious as to what everyone uses as their standard?
Not all units have the same performance cost.  Players > AI Aircraft > AI Ground/Naval > Stationary  16 players vs 20 AI aircraft will perform far worse than 2 players vs 200 tanks
thx for the tip

What's the approximate detection range on the opfor Drone Carrier?
Aircraft detecting the carrier? Or the carrier detecting players?
My bad, the carrier detecting players

Aircraft detecting the carrier? Or the carrier detecting players?
My bad, the carrier detecting players
Depends on the player's RCS. I've never used the drone carrier, but it looks like it's based on the DMS Cruiser . It probably shares the same radar, which is much weaker than NMSS Cruiser.

Is there any way to send commands to the drones launched from a drone carrier?
again, never used em. Sorry
If there is, it would have to be though commands on the carrier host

Has anyone seen this before? I'm on Win11
Yeah, I noticed this as well. Use SteamVR for creating and testing missions.
Like Boot Steam VR, then VTOL VR?

Like Boot Steam VR, then VTOL VR?
Oh, for some reason I thought you said you were using the `oculus` launch option. It only happens for me when I do that. Check if you have the oculus launch option enabled, and if so, remove it.
Nope, stock boot options

Is SteamVR launching when you start the game?
No
Ok, then you have to force SteamVR to start somehow.

Is there a way to disable NVG in a mission using a script line in the  .vts file? Want to do a Tornado GR1 mission where there is no night vision capability. I realise I could just trust people to not use it....
Nooooooooope
Hello Editors. Is there a way to assign a task and setting the waypoint automatically? As an exemple. Alpha needs to run the mission objective Air to Air. While Xray needs to go for another objective. That means that when the first objective for Alpha starts it puts the waypoint for the first mission in the MFD for the objectives. A bit later I have a time trigger to make Xray start and go for their objective. Problem is that Alpha now sees the Xray objective. The goal here is that only the team the mission is assigned for sees its objective(waypoint) in the HUD and MFD objective screen. (I know that the other objectives would still be visible in the MFD screen, which is the way it works).

Now THIS is podracing! - 3 new maps pulled directly from the 1999 video game!  After the inspiring work of gandalfnog on the original Tatooine map based on the movie. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2797075913  I thought it would be fun to re-create the game version of these iconic race maps!  The issue with the original map was it had weapons, which turned many matches just into dog fights and the podracing went to the way side. Also it had no checkpoint spawns so if you died you just had to wait the match out.  On my version: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2871110672 The maps, sounds, descriptions, are all pulled directly from the 1999 game. Every turn and visual style replicated using the map creator's height map tool then smoothed out by me.  The only thing I can't do are overhangs and tunnels so you get a lot of canyons.  3 maps:  Mon Gazza - Desert map deep within the spice mines. There are several splits and routes you can take. Some more direct but with traps. Some safer but slower.  Boonta Clasic - Your standard Tatooine race map with canyons, Tusken raiders, obstacles and lots of twists and turns.  Beedo's Wild Ride - A snow map circling the high peek of Ando Prime. As it's white walled you may have issues following portions of the course. Do your best to not run into a wall!

OK thank you...worth checking . 👍
Thats what I thought. Thanks anyhow for replying.

is it possible to turn of the mission editor hud so i can make screenshots of the mission for the briefing? I dont  want my brief images to look like *this*
Use the map editor? The units will be missing, but the briefing images are so small anyway no one will notice.
what about for images of stuff like the AWACS or carrier?

Hi. Is there a way to kill the player if he crosses a certain waypoint? and is there a way to make him being shot down?
In the public testing branch there is an action to kill a player

Bit of a silly question, but how do multiplayer missions work? I can only make one player spawn, did I miss an option for single player/multiplayer when making the mission or something?
got to make it a campaign
even with just one mission in it

Does this work with old missions too?
as in made before the MP update?
Yes

as in made before the MP update?
Yes
They may be broken for other reasons

Hello, is there a way to stop a long time burning Flare and start a flare with a different color? or do they burn the whole time you set as burn time?
yeah, they burn the whole time as far as i know
In VTOL v1.5 (in public_testing), you can make a looping trigger, which allows you to continually reignite short-lived flares and change the color based on a conditional action or end it after some condition is met.  But in the current stable version of VTOL, you pretty much have to commit to a single color and duration.

Killbox MP coming soon? 👀
Looking forward to 1.5 🙂
Tried killbox in the mp mod and it wasn't the best mp mission tbh

Damn it. i lost my mission. The files are gone. is there any way to retrieve them from Steam?
@Strikeeaglechase can recover if you can prove they're yours
Thanks for the quick reply. i will contact him.

How do I set up multiple player spawns for MP missions?
To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign. 2. Import your mission into that campaign via the campaign editor. 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer via the campaign editor.
Does the same method work with a singular mission?

Does the same method work with a singular mission?
Yes. You cannot make a standalone multiplayer mission, only multiplayer campaigns.
So you have to convert it to a campaign, then convert it to multiplayer.

I'm confused. How do I use a map I downloaded from the Steam workshop? I clicked subscribe, but from there in the game, dunno how to open it
When you go to make a new mission, the map will be selectable from the list of maps
At the veeeeeeery bottom, so it's extra convenient.

i dont half of the buttons??
That's already a mutiplayer campaign
i didnt set up the mission in a campagin

@Sypwn how many units are there in the single sector dynamic liberations?
math
guesstimate

can I select multiple units and make changes to them?
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/1026912089425592372
Nope

how many units do you have spawned at one time?
in dynlib quick
didn't you just ask me that?

didn't you just ask me that?
yeah, but you said not at one time
hold on

so some of them aren't spawned right?
It's random, and it involves math, and I'm tired
lol fair enough

Is there way to set diffferent objectives for different groups?
nope
damn

Wym? Are you telling me that some people *don't* read the brief? That's simply insane

What???? that simple 😛 Nice. Thanks.

What???? that simple 😛 Nice. Thanks.
question, for something like this, if i set it to enemy units, will a Bulwark, the enemy overlord, be set off by units on B team because they are technically the enemy team? or will it be set off by things on the A team since the A team is the enemy of that unit
"Allied" in this context means Team A

"Allied" in this context means Team A
im trying to make it so where the voiceline "Leans on overlord" is actually forced to happen, instead of what usually happens with the bulwark where it just says nothing

other thing, if i set an event trigger, will that trigger loop if the conditions are meant again? or will it just say the line once and never again
Only once ever
In the next version of VTOL in public_testing, you can make looping event sequences

could anyone help me? my friend is trying to make a mission and he wants to make it dynamic and neither of us know how to do it
If that isn't the hint you need, then you should probably start with something simpler and work your way up.
thank you

would I do that for every one of them?
Every time you need to make something random or dynamic
Here is some of the event sequence for spawning city targets in Sector A. Note the scroll bar. It is very long.

does anyone know if there is a # players check slotted for the next update? The looping function is going to be great for filling in empty slots with AI aircraft, but the "units alive" check is not going to be sufficient if players die.
What's wrong with "units alive"?
If I want to run a looping check to see number of human players, it will give bad values if it checks after a player is shot down and before he respawns

Does anyone have a visual representation of the field of view of the fire control radar?
big cone
just one very large cone

What is that 15 degrees?
Thx
Uhhh 10 degrees I think

Hey, in the mission editor you can make an action in a trigger 'send path to GPS' and then choose a target group#. This doesn't seem to work in multiplayer. I'm not seeing any path in GPS for any of my player aircraft groups. Am I missing something?
That's for single player AFAIK. Some objects you can trigger don't have specific players in mind, those are only for single player. This would also be for triggers that "open canopy" or "launch bar" etc because there's no specific player it references, it means for the single player. How I understand it.
Cool, that makes sense

anybody know why the images I put for the briefings in my missions arent showing up for my friend? they show for me but not for him

uhh how do I get that

@BahamutoD how did this happen?
for some reason only the blufor image is in the example folder
mmn ungh vtole worky game

it had another image in there but the mf just went and dipped?? dunno where hes goin but hes goin
Close the game. Move the correct `IslandsAtWar.PNG` and `IslandsAtWarOpfor.PNG` files into that folder. Replace the vts file with this one.
alright, thanks

Wait, why do you have steam installed into your user folder??
whuh
Whatever. Probably not worth fixing anyway.

what is the sivice celing of the E-4?
Dunno. Experiment yourself, or ping Chase.
Units cannot spawn higher than 33 000ft

what if i make a mountan and plan it on top?
Mountains only go to 6000m
Spawn altitude to 10 000m

so i cant get an extra 6000m?
No
10 000m ASL

is it posible to set a gps mark on the ground and have ai ground usints go there?
Just use waypoints, then use the move to waypoint function within the unit movement
no i want to tell them where to go from inside the mission

Can you edit the health values of units in the .vts to make them harder to kill in a multiplayer mission?
No, but you can toggle their invincibility.
For example, with a group of multiple units, you can make a sequence that temporarily makes them all invincible when one of them dies. This slows down anyone attempting to kill them all.

what does the "weight" do in alternate spawns? say, if one was on 100, and the other 90, what would happen when someone spawns in would they go to the one with 100 weight every time?
I thought probabilities were completely intuitive for you 🤔 `Weight` is how many marbles are in the bag to represent each alt-spawn. Spawn 1 : Weight 100 Spawn 2: Weight 200 means there is a 1/3 chance of spawning at spawn 1, and a 2/3 chance of spawning at spawn 2.
i didnt know it was probability (also, didnt mean to offend with my comment in the wishlist), I thought it was a hierarchy system. Thank you for the insight 😄 👍

Player? They are usually used for AI units to randomize where they spawn.
but no, this makes much more sense
Never used em for players

in what order will players spawn into them, numerical?
so MP Spawn 1 first, then 4 then 5 etc?
Each MP spawn unit represents a separate vehicle slot in the briefing room

so MP Spawn 1 first, then 4 then 5 etc?
Each MP spawn unit represents a separate vehicle slot in the briefing room
ok. So if i chose the top slot, it would put me in the corresponding group at the first available spawnpoint?

Just click the test mission button and see for yourself
It should all make sense

Yes, but are you using steamvr through oculus?
not to matter, i can just upload to the workshop and then playtest in a private lobby
you have to dont you?

you have to dont you?
That's a real hassle
meh i dont mind

what im saying is, its not possible to use vtol vr without it isnt it?
ah i have that
i shall change it

its possible to use vtol vr without steam vr??
yes, that's what `oculus` mode does

You made the podrace map?
How did you stop people from taking off early?
ok, quick question...  I wanna make a tutorial map for some friends, and I can do most of the things in the mission editor now, but... I cannot make short gifs/videos pop up to explain what to do like in the game's official tutorials.  am I maybe missing something?

The in game tutorials don't have any gif/video's pop up

what do you mean? see if its hidden within the game files?
I can extract that tutorial's vts file from the game files, then see which trigger action it calls to show the video. Then I can try to use that trigger action in a custom mission.
ok, yeah, im not insane.  it'd be nice if it was an official feature tho,

how do you go about doing that?
i can never find the heightmap and vts files of ingame levels for some reason
You have to datamine a bit

What would it compile to?
VTS isn't a programming language
didnt mean compile

Bundle? Yes thats how they are stored
hence the whole datamining aspect
yea thats it

It fails for everyone tho right?
So, if I go ahead and start work on a mission in PT, do you think I will be able to run on feature when 1.5 is release?  I haven't tried this before and I'm not sure the likelihood of an irreparable incompatibility.
It should be compatible

Unless baha radically changes something in an upcomming patch

does anyone have an estimate for how far away the next release is?
nooooooooooope
could be weeks, could be months

was there any leaks or hints about the heli before it released?
Yes, tons
there probably aint a new vehicle then

i was editing the .vts file for my mission and was wondering whether its possible to duplicate sequence events. Im assuming all i would need to change is the id of the event so there is no conflict am i right?
Because when i attempted this they dont show up in my sequence events list in the editor. Im assuming its because i havent changed the id of the conditional?
Duplicating entire event sequences? Or just sequence nodes?

Did you completely quit VTOL and restart?
It doesn't load changes from disk until you exit the game
ill do that

How else will people read the briefing?
too true
You convinced me

It plays video sounds too?
holy fuck thats cool
You have to pair it with a play priority message or equivalent, as seen in the screenshot

Did you place all of them manually and edit in the config?
That must take alot of dedication
Yo that's awesome. Definitely using that 👍

Is it possible to setup a mission where players start on the carrier but then when they die they start in the air?
Yes. Use the `Move Spawn` trigger action
Is it possible to change the team of enemy units? For example have an ASF-30 show up as friendly for team A on their NAV map.

No
tragic

Are there any advantages to using the VTS file to create missions outside of the ability to copy paste?
You can do some things the mission editor won't let you do
like putting buildings in weird places

How many units is too many units?
For what? Pref? Dynamic lib has 1000+ spawns with like 25% spawning
In a performance context. Like is there a recommended cap when performance starts to suffer

Depends on the type of unit and what you have it doing

If an air unit is in a group following a path and has engage enemies checked. Will it break off of the path to attack ground targets that it comes across?
Performance cost: Players > AI air > AI ground/naval > AI stationary
specifically ASF-30 against radar/sam sites

hey, if I edit my mission .vts file and change a mission critical player aircraft's lives to zero, will the logic in the game consider that unit as dead? even though it hasn't spawned yet? (this player aircraft will get lives later in the mission though. I want this aircraft to be considered alive, just unavailable until a certain point in the mission)
Always interpret the `Is Alive` condition to mean "Has not died"
 Setting a slot's initial lives to 0 simply means it cannot be used at start, until its lives are increased by triggers.
I may have misread your question, but I think I answered it

How do you convert standalone missions to campaigns?
To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign. 2. Import your mission into that campaign via the campaign editor. 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer via the campaign editor.
how do i make ai land in editor

Curious... Perhaps the dollar sign?
Nah, it seems to empty every time so I hadn't hit save. I thought "if it uploaded first time it would upload every time" but not. then forgot to hit save after filling it in again... stupid me
1 last thing, no matter what i do the stupid budget for B team keeps re setting

did you move this from single player to multiplayer?
ie to campaign?
maybe, took me  awhile to figure out how to even make an mp game

is there a  and B budget line i can add?
ok, what you need to do is make a new campaign and mission, then compare all of the lines to that of your current one to make sure youre not missing any variables
i had to do it with my project, it takes about 20 mins

why do you want them to have a budget anyway?
stop spamram, making a comp 3v3 mission
hm

AIRS-T are disabled as well then?
yeah i cant think of an immediate fix
If your goal is to make a comp mission, limiting budget will mean good players never kill each other with AIM-120s

I've got a KC49 that I'm trying to have land at an enemy airbase. it spawns quite a ways away, then just orbits in place in stead of trying to fly over and land. do I need to get it closer before telling it to land or is there something up with the kc49 landing at enemy airbases?
Did you order it to land using a trigger action?
yes

Did you order it to land using a trigger action?
yes
Does that trigger fire immediately when the mission starts or when the KC49 spawns in? If so, you should change it to have a couple seconds delay.

Does that trigger fire immediately when the mission starts or when the KC49 spawns in? If so, you should change it to have a couple seconds delay.
the trigger action for landing had a 3 second delay after the aircraft spawned in. but the aircraft is like ~50nmi from the airbase
Also, is it a Team B KC49? (Does that unit even exist?)

Also, is it a Team B KC49? (Does that unit even exist?)
it's a team A kc49 trying to land on a team b airbase, there is no kc49 on team b
Oh, AI aircraft will never land on an enemy airbase. (Probably because ATC will never give it clearance.) You could temporarily switch the allegiance of the airbase, but that might mess with other aircraft.

any way to spawn an ai av42 that's already loaded up with guys on a cruiser though?
if not that's not a big deal, i can still work around it
Pretty sure you can spawn in an AI AV-42 full of infantry. There's an extra button in the AI AV-42 unit properties dialog for it. Never used it myself, and I wouldn't be surprised if putting it on a carrier breaks that.

Anyone know why sometimes images I put onto my senarios refuse to update? "No image"
cant get this bad boy to change to "saved"
I was able to fix it by editing the xml manually. weird

is there a way to detect how many players are online?   I want to spawn AI wingmen when there are too few players online, and despawn them if more players join
Currently there isn't a way to check how many players are in the game exactly
The best you can do is check how many player planes are alive with a looping event, and spawn AI aircraft if it's below a threshold

is there a way to "reset" an objective so it can be done again?
No
Well, you could cancel it instead of completing

so the only way to cancel an objective is through an event?
correct
nice

What's the question? And what's a "protect variable"?
how can I make it to where as long as a single unit from a list is alive you still pass?
Use a conditional objective

how can I make it to where as long as a single unit from a list is alive you still pass?
Use a conditional objective
fail condition: UnitList <units to protect> ~~is not all alive~~ num alive equals 0

is it possible to update the available weapons for a player after the game starts ? As in during a re-arming .. ?
No. But you can add slots that have 0 lives at start, and unlock them with triggers. Those slots can have more weapon options.
interesting .. ok thanks

I've got my convoy set to a path, and speed "fast" however they dont seem to move. Do they need to have a road under them or something?
Land units that are in a unit group must be ordered to move with unit group actions.
Default behavior doesn't work once they are in a group, for some reason.

and for ground targets, does railpath work better than path?
assume not or it'll clip through the ground hah
Railpath is deprecated. Don't use it

Is it normal for AI craft to follow a player even if they are not part of their flight group?  I got the mission im working up set up that one wingman will spawn per player that joins, so that every player will have one AI wingman, however when i tested the mission with a friend, the AI did not want to follow either of us until we gave the "form up" command, and when we did that, all the wingmen formed up on only one of us, regardless of flight group.
Never used AI wingmen, sorry :/
is ok. Hoping someone else can help tho

How do I make a multiplayer mission? I can't make a second player unit, so how do I go about it?
ah sorry, found the help post by the ATCBot. thank you
How do I make the player an aircraft other than the AV-24C

How do I create FARP in the mission editor?
Rearm points are a type of unit you can create
thank you!

I have a condition > Unit group:Alpha > Num Alive == 0  > AND  > TeamB kills > 0   This was true after one kill even though Alpha still had players in the air, any idea what I did wrong?
Players don't count for unit groups. Use a UnitList instead
Oh ok, thanks 👍

Does the fire ctrl radar p have the same stats as the fire ctrl radar?
I don't know which, but one of them has more transmitter power (I would assume the fcr P is the FCR2 in this graph)
Perhaps

I’d estimate like 14-18 ish based off of memory i think?
your guess is better than mine
maybe a decent way to measure performance would be deltaV

How'd you pull that off?
Iirc there's a position value in the vts you can tweak that dosn't actually move the airbase but does change where trees can/can't spawn
game updated trees in, then updated them out

problem is, they dont line up in the editor. The names of the units in the editor are MP Spawn [n], how do i tell which one is which?
should i just remove them all and add them back in in the order i want potential players to spawn
If you remove them all, you could break triggers and actions that reference Alpha group. Better to leave at least one member at all times.  They will always show up on the slot list in UnitID order you cannot change that without modifying the .vts. What you want to do is make the unit group member order match that.

What's wpn count? Does it tell you the armament of the player?
you should make a guide on all vteditor hidden functionality
Can you find the independence day UFOs in source code, and if so, can they be called by editing the .vts? Asking for a friend.

Anyway, you can only do it for AI kestrels, and it's a button at the top of the unit properties dialog
Same place you set aircraft starting on a carrier

8 men per kestrel right?
yep
it would prob sync incorrectly

i made a map but it won't let the host get in the plane. Any idea of how I can fix that? Map is Day 2 of the Kyushu multiplayer campaign
Wow, you're right. That's a bug!
Which file did you find this in? I need to find the unitID and .vts/.vtc format to spawn a ufo fighter.

Which file did you find this in? I need to find the unitID and .vts/.vtc format to spawn a ufo fighter.
I didn't, that was Red Elite. It's only used in that workshop mission, which I assume is encrypted. You can ask Red Elite for the info, or decompile the game and search for the list of units.

Can I remedy this somehow or are you working on a bugfix for this certain issue yourself? I could try changing a few things out that I've never used before for things I know would work in their stead
Baha will likely fix it at some point, but if you want to look for a work around, it seems somehow related to ASF-30 [208], my guess its unit group/unit group actions somehow
If I had to guess, having the AI aircraft in the same group as the rocket boats fucks up something

@Tyron did you edit the VTS at some point?
Well there's the problem
I didn't edit the VTS, no. But it sometimes happens that units get mangled up in different groups, I had that happen before

What method do you usually use to assign group membership? Selecting it in the unit dialog? Mass-assignment through the unit groups list? Copying units?
Normally just single-selecting a unit and assigning it but for the ones that got mangled I had them copied from an existing configured unit
tfw you spend about 4 hours in the editor and lose everything to a power outage fml

Let's say I want jets to take off with a delay to another group taking off. Would the events look something like this? It didn't work when I checked; Kilo took off 60s after mission launch instead of waiting 60s after Bravo is airborne
Does the bravo group spawn in immediately?
yeah. They are all parked by default

Does the bravo group spawn in immediately?
yeah. They are all parked by default
Correct me if im wrong sypwn, but i believe what is happening here is that for a brief moment when you load in, the game thinks all units are airborne. Therefore, what i would do is change the delay on the first node to 10, 15 seconds. And move the entry condition from the first node to the second

the delay in the top left of each timed sequenced action refers to it being before the entry condition is met or is it after?
I believe before
i may be wrong tho

Silly question but what does the "training mission" checkbox do when creating a mission?
I dont actually know, i think it disables quick saves for singleplayer missions
I feel that Euler has screwed me over here.

What are you trying to make, a bunker?

Just testing using slanted platforms as a "skirt" around a large raised platform.

How do I make a path that infinitely loops around a given path? Does the loop function do that automatically? And what is a Rail Path vs the normal Path a unit can undertake?
When constructing the path, check the "loop" box.  Rail Path is deprecated. Do not use it. Just use Path
that makes sense. My tanks didn't move, haha :D

Is it reasonable to ask this guy to not call his mission "Dynamic Combined Arms Liberation"?
ehhh
Like, I don't claim ownership of either of those words individually, but please don't use them together :/

@Sypwn so what do you reckon they'd be doing? BTW thnks for response. i seem to have Discord connectivity at present. Previously have 'unable to update Discord', then text loads but images won't (until I disable Kaspersky AV). is all a bit weird - first Oculus wouldn't connect to internet, then (a few weeks later) Skype f*cked up, now Discord!?
If you work for a three letter government agency, then they would theoretically use it to copy data from your computer and otherwise spy on you. Otherwise, they might use it for a botnet.  But it doesn't matter. Just uninstall Kaspersky. Windows Defender is good enough these days.
Also, this conversation doesn't belong in #mission_editor

Whats the best way to make a group of aicraft take off and attack a certain target? set them to take off and in the same trigger add priority targets?
like that?
`Attack Target` and `Set Designated Targets` should both work, engaging the target regardless of distance. `Set Priority Targets` only works if the target enters their engagement range.

will it both work in the same event or do i have to wait with the target designation until they all took off?
`Set Designated Targets` can be set anytime as long as they are alive. They will engage when able. `Attack Target` I'm not sure about
attack target im pretty sure just makes them instantly know where their target is and disregard everything else till they knock it out

does unit that is not yet spawned count as dead if it is in a unit list thats set to trigger if "not all alive"?
if it's waiting to spawn it is not dead
Consider alive to mean "has not died yet"

I can't get ground tanks to follow the path I have set up. Any guides? They should follow at spawn but they dont move
Are they in a group?
A unit group, like Alpha or Charlie

Are they in a group?
A unit group, like Alpha or Charlie
Yes but I want them to travel individually

Could I make them not part of a group but share a path?
Or make individual paths
Yes, but you'd have to issue each individual unit separate movement actions (or only stick with default behavior)

So the only thing I'm missing is that theyre in a group?
Its not too fancy
Yeah. If you ungroup them, place one in each corner of the square path, and set their default behavior to path (with that square path selected), then I think they will do what you want.

will a required objective with no success condition keep the mssion from being completed? a.i., "protect carrier" fail= carrier destroyed, success= none
Yes, because objectives can be set completed by separate trigger actions.
ok

whats the best way to trigger it complete once all other objectives are complete?
Have a GV that increments by 1 when each other objective completes, and when it reaches the right number than that last objective completes.
thats gonna be fun. never used global values

have you ever programmed anything? GVs are just integer variables
nope
Ok then, it's just a number stored and tracked by the game. You can set the initial value, you can change it with actions, and you can check it with conditions.

this menu? dont see it here. im guessing somewhere else
System
ah

and just do that for every objective and then set the protect carrier to be completed once [number of objectives] is reached?
yes
Or alternatively, you could have an objective that fires using "Prereqs". So it only fires once all the objectives before it are complete

also, what do you guys think of having to drop off ground crew at an airbase to use it for refueling? i always thought its kinda weird that we bomb a place to pieces and sudddenly the ground crew materialzes and is  telling you theyre ready
good idea
now i wish we could place and keep infantry on moving carriers. for now i have to make up some story of how they managaed to swim to an island near the AO the day before lol

I want to work on some missions while I’ve got downtime at work, but I can’t run VR on my work computer, it’s isn’t compatible.

Why not just fix it?

...what?

if i go into the map the mission is using and change something, will it just accept it on the mission folder as well?
That's what the `Tools -> Repack Map` button does. Update the mission with the latest version of the custom map.
So you change it in the map editor, then go into the mission editor and repack.

okay, save and quit mission editor, open map editor, fix it, open mission editor, repack?
exactly
The reason the road cuts off is because it's technically a bridge at that point. You need to delete that last road segment, then add two short segments at the end that are both grounded to fully convert it to grounded road.

how do i make a road flush with the ground?
Shift-scroll down, or something like that
itrs ctrl

Did you make two new segments like I said?
ye

also, why is my MAD-4 radar and launcher group not doing anything? is there anything else i have to do to make them engage?

any way to make ships move in a coloum or tighter V formation?

Not in formation, no. You can kinda fake column by making them split up and follow the same path independently, but the ships have different top speeds and won't stick together. https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/962116934730678332/1023827513153175582

what are the capabilities of the rocket boat? are they unguided rockets, heat seeking, do they act like artillery?
Unguided. The can engage other naval targets, or ground targets near the shore. They do a significant amount of damage though.

unrelated, whats the max range of the opfor artillery guns/ the trucks?
I think 30km

conditional triggers when units get too close the instantly combust?
as in "unit: playerspawnxyz near waypoint playerspawn123 radius 10m= destroy unit playerspawnxyz"
would have to manually set up all the possible collisions. idek if you can select playerspawns as waypoints in the condition logic

"if p1 is near p2 or p3 or p4 or p5 or p4= destroy p1" wont work?
Make event trigger with a unit list, then use a `Conditional Action` to determine which units collided and blow them up
there would have to be one trigger event for each possible collision, no?

there would have to be one trigger event for each possible collision, no?
Although I'm not sure if blowing one of the players up will make impossible to detect which other player involved.
with 6 players on each team that 36 events

what is the unit for initial and nav airspeed in the mission editor?
is it knots or m/s
m/s. everything in the editor is meters

at this point it would probably be worth your time to write a script to do it for you

i just realized, this will only work if one team is only hunting and one only being hunted. cus, how are you going to determine who earned the kill?
alright, i have a setup that might work. 4 players each team. 2 hunters, 2 hunted. hunter is F-45 with no equips, hunted is F-26 with a gun.
NEVERMIND players cannot be killed using events???

Fair enough, thank you.

Still no spawning infantry on boats, right?
yes. You can place infantry on a non moving carrier/cruiser or drop them off there with a AV, but as soon as the ship moves they will be left floating

Question about briefings ; is there something in the editor I need to select for a mission to be able to use the nice big defcon room looking breifing room?
The choice of the briefing room is up to the person hosting the mission
It is also restricted by the number of player slots; missions with a lot of slots will only be able to use the combined large room with bleachers

is there a way to change the units?

I'm catching up on repeatable actions in mission editor. Can someone pls give me a short description of repeating actions/events. How does it work? How do you configure to get an event/action to fire again.  Pls
Switch to the public_testing branch of VTOL. Looping triggers were only just added in 1.5.0 Create an event sequence. Check the "While" box. Leave the while condition as "true"
Give your sequence's first node an entry condition of when you want it to fire.
Of course your mission won't be playable by the general public until 1.5.0 gets pushed to stable, which could be quite a while at this point.

how do I make objectives optional?
Uncheck the "Required" box in the objective properties
The mission ends in success when all Required objectives are completed, or ends in failure if any Required objectives are failed.

Any way to re-order the objectives? Dragging them around in the objectives menu doesnt seem to do anything. They stay in the order they were created
Activate them in a specific order
(But late joiners will always see them in the order you initially created them)

After playing the mission, search your player.log for the name/id of that AWACS. If something is preventing it from spawning, it should show up there.

Need help. Making MP mission on custom made map. Set default path to a given path. Another aircraft default orbit to a given way point to orbit.   Set to takeoff ready so they’re engines hot.

I haven’t tried placing them airborne as I want the enemy planes to take off as we do.
Set their default behavior to takeoff, not path
Once they takeoff and complete this given command, do they the default to their next command entry? Ether path or orbit?    Also without any given command after take off, what is their default behaviour?

does this campaign have any other missions in it, besides teh one we're looking at?
it’s one mission and a lot of targets
???

or more options to displaying hints /text than there currently are... is it possible to set these infinitely instead of having them disappear after 1-99999s?
Make it an objective
I wouldn't want popup text blocking my view for an entire mission

hi, i am trying to write a sequence to make an ai AV-42 do a pickup mission (mostly just for fun) but for some reason whenever it tries to take off after the pickup it immediately flips forwards and ends up on the ground on its back, any ideas what is going wrong?
Nap time : ]
well it is 11:30pm for me so almost

Does it follow a path?
no, just take off
with a delay 3 second delay for the next action (RTB)

What happens if you don't have the land at waypoint action?
And does the kestrel flip over immediately after taking off?
lets see

And does the kestrel flip over immediately after taking off?
lets see
yes, will film it this time

how do i report bugs?
make a post in #vtolvr-bugs
ok

How did you get that view in the editor?
good point, it is landing under full AA and missile fire
push insert to get debug camera

Does anyone know why my MP map has 12 player slots but will only let 8 people join a team and the rest get stuck on the team select screen?
that's the limit
theres a slider in the menu with which you can limit the amount of players, the people that can spawn in are limited by the number of player aircraft

are there more than 8 aircraft slots?
there is like 30 player spawn
it just started happening not long ago but before i could have 12 in the lobby

does the briefing room have enough seats?
idk
yeah its the large room with the 2 rows of chairs on both sides like every other mission

Could you put a road there that goes uphill slightly to stop it from flipping forward?
not easily. Im using the default island map. Not up to making my own
I can try and set the waypoint so that it is taking off from one of the existing roads

Is there any tutorial guides for making automatically spawning AI? I want to make AI automatically respawn/fresh spawn in and follow default route/orbit, AFTER certain AI planes/patrols have been destroyed. I think it uses the logic panel but I’ve no idea how it what to use.
only in public testing right now
looping event sequences and respawnable units is what you are looking for

Either that or delay AI from following take off sequence.    Or can I for example, place in editor but NOT spawned in. So the event can be, if unit Bravo is not present they spawn in?
yes. you can check the "respawnable" box on units to make them respawnable. You can already place units but uncheck "spawn immediately" and they won't spawn until you make them
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/1037631734356918312

So with this. In THEORY. I could have many many units at a secondary airfield spawn in under an event action. Such as Bravo Unit being killed? So on so forth
You just can't have killed units respawn
Yes. This is how Dynamic Liberation reinforcements currently work. Many many copies of the same units.

So I can, have BRAVO unit spawn once ALPHA is destroyed.   Then CHARLIE unit spawn once BRAVO is destroyed and so on. That would be how to do it, correct?   With entering commands. I would leave default behaviour as take off and default path to the path I want them to fly and the newly spawned in unit will follow these like normal?
Yes, exactly
Put all that in a single Event Sequence.

How do I do this? I had a brief look but it intimidated me. Tried Google but direct video to explain it
Nevermind lol already said it
Not near a computer right now or I would send you a screenshot

hello fellas, ive been working on a map which is intended to be open world with the random encounters mod.   I have an AWACS and tanker setup to be flying around the friendly area of the map and they both have different paths set, but no matter what ive tried, they both stick to the same path and orbit right next to each other (which makes refuelling unnecessarily difficult). does anyone know what the issue could be?
you need them to be in different groups, otherwise they will try and form up together
didnt think of that :o

do the event sequences delay timers start right away or do they only start once entry conditions are met?
I would think the timer starts first then does the entry check once the timer runs out right?
Delay -> Entry condition -> Action -> Exit condition

I would think the timer starts first then does the entry check once the timer runs out right?
Delay -> Entry condition -> Action -> Exit condition
If you want a delay **after **a condition is met, then you need to put that condition in the exit condition of the previous node

Dumb question but i wanted to be sure when you upload a map to the steam workshop do you update it the same way? By uploading the same missions just new ones
> Dumb question but i wanted to be sure when you upload a map to the steam workshop do you update it the same way? Yes  > By uploading the same missions just new ones What?
Ah sorry about that me being bad at English

But thanks

so how does a sequence work with nodes vs actions?
👆
each component is optional

so why would a taxi action be getting skipped?
Nothing is skipped
ok, why would it be taking off wihtout taxiing?

ok, why would it be taking off wihtout taxiing?
what's "it"?
an AI av42

is there a way to force it to?
dunno
never tried

there are no time stamps, it this oldest first or newest first?
oldest at the top
search for the name of the unit, or the name of the sequence node

is there a way to make infantry act normal when under fire not just stand there?
Are they set to engage enemies? Are there nearby enemies they can shoot at?
yes and yes but they just stand there

Are they set to engage enemies? Are there nearby enemies they can shoot at?
yes and yes but they just stand there
They won't take cover or nothing, but they should be shooting

will tanks with engage set but stop to engage unset shoot while moving?
yes
cool

anyone know if the gav-25 has a twr limit for vertical takeoff?
I believe the TWR requited for all VTOL AI is 1.1
thanks. thats why they haven't been taking off then.

Can anyone confirm for spawning in enemies.  Alpha unit. spawn immediately. Bravo, DO NOT spawn immediately.  Event as follows, entry condition: Alpha number alive 0=output.  Exit condition: Bravo All Alive=Output.  Doing this will spawn in Bravo units once ALL Alpha units are dead, Correct?
Your entry condition is correct, but your exit condition makes no sense. You'll want to use an action to spawn bravo, not a condition
So, Remove conidiont and add action

That will then spawn in Bravo under the condition Alpha are all dead?
Yes
Once again Sypwn you have saved A LOT of swearing 🙂 appreciate it all!

Question is, any idea why the rest of the server doesn't hear the audio?
most likely this logic only runs on the host, and the sound isn't synchronised
do not quote me on this, am not multiplayer mission maker

Me again.   So I have two enemy airfields that are set to become ours once we destroy X amount of enemies for repairs and re-arm...  How will I stop the newly placed spawn-in enemies from spawning there once we take control of alpha and bravo base?
use a Global Value
or, stop the reinforcement sequence when the airbase is captured

Can you link a "how to" guide on that?
there are no guides
Because simply put, ive copied the units changed names and set them to spawn when their counter part units all die and follow the set commands, take off/default path etc

and it's all handled in one large Event Sequence, right?
have a global variable like: "Basecaptured" set to 0, and set it to 1 after its captured. Global variables are in the same category as scenario info i believe
you can use global variables in conditions

So in objectives, under completed event, New action Alpha respawn=Stop sequence. and this stops ALL event sequence of the preset I have for respawn?
So sorry I'm not the best at explaining
> So in objectives, under completed event, New action Alpha respawn=Stop sequence Yes  > this stops ALL event sequence of the preset I have for respawn? As far as I understand, yes

> So in objectives, under completed event, New action Alpha respawn=Stop sequence Yes  > this stops ALL event sequence of the preset I have for respawn? As far as I understand, yes
then post screenshots instead of text explainations
everyone loves screenshots

what does the follow behavure do on grounfd units?
not sure
oof

oh, and another thing I am curious about with the current pub test. Lets say you have a large enemy group and half of them have been killed. If you have the entire group force respawned by an event, does it just respawn the dead units, or does the *entire* unit list/group get respawned in it's entirety? (creating even more units than were originally spawned.)
only units that are dead will be respawned
noice

Will this work on multiplayer too?
Only for ai iirc
Hmmm

i cant get this convoy to move on the rail path for the life of me lol any ideas why they wont budge?
iirc railpath is a discountined feature, just use regular path mode
sorry i made a path I've set them to follow the path and there fucking stood there

yea then not sure, take a look through your logic and if you dont notice anything send an image i guess?
fuck it im off to bed haha will try tomorrow
thank you dude!

is there any simple way to modify the default missions? say for example I wanted to play some of the F26 campaign as an F45, some of the F45 quick missions as an AV-42, etc
Yes but requires some work/extracting the game
Not quite "simple". You have to extract the asset files with AssetRipper, then convert them to .vts files.

How do alt spawns work so i want the helio to spawn on a fob base after we take it do i have to put another spawn on the position?
Don't use alt-spawns for that. Use the "Move Spawn" action
Alt-spawns are primarily for randomizing the position of AI units

do flying units always have to take off in order to be airborne or can i spawn them in the air?
i tried to spawn them in the air and set a path but they never got there
did you give them fuel and an initial speed?

did you give them fuel and an initial speed?
yes you can spawn aircraft in the air
this is my convoy atm... they wont budge

were do i make these actions?
thank you
like this?

awesome so they should move now?
if i want to make this convoy bigger now can i just copy the units?
will they all take the same action

if i want to make this convoy bigger now can i just copy the units?
will they all take the same action
Yeah, as long as they are in alpha group

well i give this ago and if i get stuck again can i give u a shout?
thanks so much for helpinf dude! im such a boomer when it comes to this shit haha
Just ask your questions here in this channel.

Hey everyone!  Looking for a bit of help.   If i create a path like this, is there a way I can trigger it to be set as a route on the nav screen?
I.E by hitting a waypoint trigger
I'm not sure, if I want to create a "route" I'll just normally use a load of waypoints which I then connect to objectives which only activate once the previous objectives are complete

Me again...  So, after we take say, Alpha base and it becomes friendly ally base. How can I set this as a new respawn instead of the initial FOB airfield?
use the Move Spawn trigger action
you can put it in the complete actions of the objective to capture the airbase

Can I not move spawn for Unitgroup? I assume I will need to add MP spawn to that location or does it make me place new spawn after the event trigger
> Can I not move spawn for Unitgroup? No. That would move the entire unitgroup into one spot, so everyone would spawn inside each other, lol. You'll want people to spawn in different hangers or helipads or whatever.  > I assume I will need to add MP spawn to that location No. The Move Spawn trigger makes you set a new location through the trigger
To the left of UI.. Thats the new spawn?

Purple smudge orb
yeah

Does the headig not follow your orange radar thing on the editor with the arrow for facing direction?
what orange radar thing?
That

Sweet jesus. Okay next one. How to reference curser heading, is it in 360 compass value? For example 0 is north 180 south etc?
because the Move Spawn action was quickly added in 5 minutes in response to AH-94s being otherwise unplayable in Dynamic Liberation
Yes. You can see the current cursor heading at the bottom of the screen.

is there a way to change player spawn points? or is that just for AI
Scroll up. That's the conversation I just had with Ducky
awkward. thanks

For a cleaner lobby look and story line  is it not possible to do it the way I mentioned then?
If it works it works I’m happy! Just tidiness of story line and lobby appearance that’s all
I'm not sure

Help. I just deleted a custom campaign I have been working on. It wasn't uploaded to steam yet. Any ideas if I can retrieve it somehow?
do you have any back-ups? like file history?
I'm just trying a system restore to see if I can see the campaign folder is back before I open up vtol again

Enable limited lives for that helicopter slot. Go into the .vts and change the initial lives to 0. To unlock the slot, grant it 99 lives or whatever with a trigger.

I am trying to access the debug camera, but when I press the insert key nothing happens. Can someone help me?
You need to make a pilot named "devcam" and use that when you test the mission. Also try pressing shift-insert. Sometimes only that works for some reason.
IIRC devcam is only necessary in mp

That worked, thanks a lot! Also, is there a way to skip the team selection screen, so I don't have to put on my goggles everytime?
Only by converting the mission back to singleplayer.
I created Dyn Lib initially as a singleplayer mission, then converted it to MP once all the mission logic was done and tested. The ability to remotely kill units and fast-forward in the devcam are also exclusive to singleplayer missions and super useful.

Okay, how can I convert a MP mission to a SP one?
Create a SP mission and add one player spawn. Create an MP mission and add one player spawn. Open both .vts files in Notepad++ or equivalent and study the differences.
I used AI aircraft to represent the other players while I was working on the mission, then manually converted them back to MP slots when I converted the rest of the mission. That way I could program in all the triggers that reference them.

SO. to set a Bravo base to spawn in nonespawned AI AFTER Alpha base has been taken.. do I just begin event sequence bravo base start with ONLY a new action " Spawn XXX unit "?
objective finish events
event sequence to begin after alpha base is taken

So the secondary photo is fine? it will begin event seuqence and follow the action " spawn XXX unit "
and then any spawn unit sequence after will active once XXX unit is dead
If all you're doing is spawning those units immediately, you can cut out the sequence entirely and spawn them directly from the objective complete action from the previous base

So having both an event sequence AND obj complete action to spawn, will not cause any problems?
What you have in the pictures will work fine
Thanks ❤️

Hey, I'm making an absolutely amazing rescue mission. How do I get the infantrymen to get into the airplane when they land?
Is the AV-42 a player or is it AI?
they will end up being AI. It's for multiplayer.

Is the AV-42 a player or is it AI?

You have to use an event action to tell the AI to pick them up.  You may first have to tell them to land nearby. I haven't used pickups myself yet. @ISEGaming may know more.

Having both the ship and jets set to spawn in with either objective finish or even sequence, this will work like an airbase correct?
Yes. Although you may want to delay the spawning of the aircraft for a second after the carrier spawns. Otherwise there is a race condition where the aircraft sometimes won't spawn.
How do I delay? I assume thats in the event sequence for "spawn unit group "?

How do I delay? I assume thats in the event sequence for "spawn unit group "?
Split it into two nodes in the sequence. First node spawns the carrier (and other ships) with no delay. Second node spawns the aircraft, but set the delay to 0.1
Like so?

First carrier spawns and jets 0.01 after.. once first jets are numberalive=0 carrier 2 and secondary jets spawn in. That is correct I believe?
I've added 0.01 to second jets to prevent issues
Wait, so the second carrier just pops in once you kill the first set of aircraft??  Why not make them all spawn in with the planes parked, and have the second set take off when the first are destroyed?

Or wait for 1.5 when you can respawn units
Trying to keep performance up which is why I went that route. Which would be better?

Trying to keep performance up which is why I went that route. Which would be better?
they have roughly 15nm to cover before they get to where friendly will be
Stationary units don't use much performance

Okay! I will give it a whirl! But for future big big missions, what I had was correct for it to work?
Appreciate it!
For future big big missions, use 1.5 unit respawning as much as possible

*reads* looks like you guys explained the whole Player AV-42 picking up Soliders to @udjason?
_me again_  If I place ASF30's on the same flight path as an enemy AWACS.. will they convoy or will they fly off and leave the AWACS?
what is the range of the mpa155

_me again_  If I place ASF30's on the same flight path as an enemy AWACS.. will they convoy or will they fly off and leave the AWACS?
what is the range of the mpa155
~26km on flat terrain

question, does the mission editor have a trigger for hitting a specific waypoint with a weapon of any kind?
nope
you could simulate it probably

whta is the firerate of the mpa155?
uhh
It's fairly quick

isnt a salvo a shot?
No
i want to know the how long it takes for the pice to shoot and then shoot agian

if i set a desingnated target to a group will a mpa155 attack that target?
Yes
same with priority?

will it stack the bodies of the targets?
I read too quick sometimes
i read quick all thre time

If you set it to attack a group?
no if the arty pice in in a grou and i give it a priority target as a group
Yes the whole group will fire

Will they return to formation if they destroy enemies? I want them to convoy and protect the AWACS
Yeah
Sorry, the AWACS is enemy AWACS, being escorted by X3 ASF-30's

Can I set Enemy Sam Radar to respawn after being destroyed? Or do I need to set up alternative radars to "spawn in" after the primary radar is downed?
Don't think it will work for new actions "spawn unit" after it is destroyed
In VTOL 1.5.0 yes. I'm the current stable version no

Does anyone know of a way to create a timer that increments every second without using the 1.5 features?
using 1.5 features is a way
I will show myself out

Only using a timed event or sequence with 1s delay. For what purpose do you want this?
i was going to create a timer that counted down from 10 minutes, but i realised i could just use a 10 min delay for timed trigger
I was going to ask, why do you need one second increments?

I was going to ask, why do you need one second increments?
But it sounds like you have it figured out
I dont, but now im curious if its possible without the looping triggers

may do in the future?
HS will probably never support triggers or AI, because of how complicated the code is for that.
Does chase have to write it himself?

Does chase have to write it himself?
yeah
makes sense

I think ive already suggested this, but how cool would it be to have an AI in the HS that uses machine learning to get better at beating people?
I would have to entirely write the AI and the physics
For PvP, most of the data is just players updating each other on who is where and who is doing what. HS simply forwards that data between the players. It doesn't even know the full state of the game.  Triggers and AI are both processed exclusively by the host, then the result is sent to the other clients. The other clients don't help with it at all, so HS would have to do that. Chase can't just steal all that code from VTOL, so he'd have to write it from scratch.

I'm trying to add a capture base to my campaign but I'm not sure how to go about it. Is it under BASE, Targets and then set team? It's a little confusing as to what constitutes taking a base.
That's how you set the initial team. You can change the base's faction as part of on objective's Completion Action
where might i find that in this menu?

where might i find that in this menu?
That's it, you got it
Sorry, I thought you were asking about the Base's tab on the right side of the editor

how does the weight in alternate spawns work, is it a percentage chance?
because if i leave them all at 100 if always chooses the first available spawn
if they all have a weight of 100, then there is an equal chance of rolling any of them

does sync group affect anything?
because i seem to be alwasy spawning in the same place
IIRC is object A has a weight 1 and object B has a weight of 3, the object A has a 25% chance of spawning

How would one properly tell an AI AV42 to land, pickup soldiers, and then take off again?
also what is the difference between Land at Wpt w/ direction and Land at Wpt w/ dir facing?
Land at wpt is just land at this spot. land at wpt w/ dir is land at this spot and when you land you need to be facing x direction

also what is the difference between Land at Wpt w/ direction and Land at Wpt w/ dir facing?
Land at wpt is just land at this spot. land at wpt w/ dir is land at this spot and when you land you need to be facing x direction
Do alt spawns work in mp spawn class?

Do alt spawns work in mp spawn class?
I think so, but they're only rolled once at the start of the mission.
You need looping triggers to properly randomize player spawns.

are looping triggers possible now?
In the 1.5.0 PTB
how do I make an alt spawn weight 0?

how do I make an alt spawn weight 0?
I want to make checkpoints so players that die dont get left behind
Do I just make it 1, hope they spawn in the right spot, and then force the spawn once they've reached the checkpoint?

Do I just make it 1, hope they spawn in the right spot, and then force the spawn once they've reached the checkpoint?
just use the move spawn action?
thats a thing?

just use the move spawn action?
thats a thing?
oh

in objectives what is per kill reward?
there is no points in vtol
and also what is full completion bonus??

and also what is full completion bonus??
ayyy
or is it just kills counted to the players stats?

or is it just kills counted to the players stats?
Those rewards are all about ingame $$, only really useful in singleplayer campaigns.
ahh

Can you get to the mission editor without a headset on hand?
Yes there are buttons on screen when you first launch the game
Yes

are there people who make missions for people? i acc suck at it terribly
Not really. But if you detail what you're looking for, and the idea is appealing, you might just inspire someone to make it.
what is this

how do i get pre planned GPS points?
There's an event action under System -> System. I think it's called "Send waypoint to GPS"
okay cool thank you

What kinder mission you after?
WAIT. So I don’t need to add rearm stations to the hangers…? Once we capture their bases we have access to them?
Is it possible to spawn an enemy multiple times?

WAIT. So I don’t need to add rearm stations to the hangers…? Once we capture their bases we have access to them?
Is it possible to spawn an enemy multiple times?
In 1.5 yes

Is it possible to spawn an enemy multiple times?
In 1.5 yes
and for now?

any idea when 1.5 is coming to stable?
I guess thats up to baha
Yeah baha probably dosn't even know

can anyone tell me how to sett the aircraft im using?
So I'm guessing you're trying to get all of them to take off once one of them takes off?
Yeah that’s right. Both AV are meant to take off when any of the 4 player vehicles take off

So I'm guessing you're trying to get all of them to take off once one of them takes off?
Yeah that’s right. Both AV are meant to take off when any of the 4 player vehicles take off
Pinned a message.

Sorry, So now that the AVs take off loaded with troops the next event is land at WPT                 but it seems like the AVs are just orbiting a waypoint which is the last event in my sequence?

An airborne AI's default behavior if it has no other active orders is to orbit its "Default orbit point" if one is set in its unit properties, or orbit its spawn point if not. Could this be what's happening?  As for why it has no other active orders, check your player.log. Not only is the firing of each event sequence node logged, but issues with AI orders are often logged there as well.

To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

is this how the sequence is meant to work? do i need to add entry/exit conditions too all the nodes to properly time the events?
Oh yeah, actions in VTOL are never blocking.
If a sequence needs to wait for something, there needs to be an entry/exit condition

Im having trouble making ai f45s engage enemy players. They have weapons and are set to engage. Is there something im missing?
Fuel?
were it so easy

Can they still detect them without it?
No if you have them with radar off they won’t engage with fox-3s. They will shoot fox-2s when they get super close
Does tis apply for enemy AI, set radar OFF and they won’t use fox 3?

Does tis apply for enemy AI, set radar OFF and they won’t use fox 3?
Even if they’re armed with fox 3’s.
Correct

I am trying to make it so that a MAD-4 radar and launcher truck moves after it launches a missile. What would be the best way to create this behavior?
You can't detect when it launched a missile.  You may have to first tell the radar to pack up by turning off "engage enemies"
what is meant by "is detected by enemy team"?

what is meant by "is detected by enemy team"?
does that count rwr detection from a player or is that only when it shows up on nav map?
Not for RWR

does that count rwr detection from a player or is that only when it shows up on nav map?
Not for RWR
(replied to wrong comment)

While I have you here do you mind talking with me about how the vehicle control events work?
I notice that you can use conditional triggers to detect when certain switches and such are interacted with in the cockpit
I actually have to go now, sorry

When I complete objective it starts objective B.  Under the start it will begin Event Sequence as shown. This will work correct? I dont need entry or exit conditions.  It is a naval carrier and x10 jets. Jets are on a 0.01S delay as suggested beforehand
Had an issue with spawn enemies so simplifying step by step to make sure it works
yeah

_Ignore location_  Once spawned onto carrier, they will automatically take off and follow given path, correct?  My understanding is,  this will work.
they should
Can I run two nodes in an event sequence, using the same entry condition " Unit A num alive=0 "

you mean in 1.5? in VTOL 1.4, unspawned units are always considered alive, so repeating an alive check like that is pointless
It's for separate nodes to spawn carrier and then jets in 1.4
what's the point to adding that condition to the second entry condition?

what's the point to adding that condition to the second entry condition?
I assume if I want the node to activate I need an entry condition
Or will it activate from top and begin going downwards once node 1 entry conditions are met, therefor making node 2 entry condition pointless/not needed?

Or will it activate from top and begin going downwards once node 1 entry conditions are met, therefor making node 2 entry condition pointless/not needed?
no
delay is optional entry condition is optional actions are optional exit condition is optional

Can I restrict weapons at different airfields? I want to make an aircraft that can't spawn with any weapons and has to go somewhere to get them
Yeah, but the player will have to manually switch between planes in the lobby
You can do that by limiting the amount of lives a spawn has

_is_ there a way I can make myself invincible in MP lobbies I host.  As I make and test missions among my friends I wanna be able to fly about freely and see what is taking off and what unbits spawn in etc.. so is there a way I can make myself invincible so I can monitor and watch how the mission develops?
I don't think you can in the editor
You may be able to in .vts

Why do you need to be flying around, why don't you just use insert camera?
What's insert camera?
devcam

I thought you had to name yourself "devcam" as well?
yes
Oh ok

Are you going to run the HS and the BFM thingy on the same lobby or 2 different ones?
HC?

Can you not have this conversation here?
Trying to test a mission and discord won't stop chirping
kek

do you have pings on in such a way that you get pinged whenever someone types in this channel?
yes

is there anything other than the static crashed av42c that emits black smoke?
I built a PvP Strike Mission for AH-94 anyone wanna help me playtest and figure out bugs and test functionality before I release?
can you make a black flare?

how to you spawn a flare?

can you make a black flare?
how to you spawn a flare?
LOL

how to you spawn a flare?
LOL
it's a trigger action, I think under System -> System

that cannot be much to ask for?
you can probably hide the crashed av42 under the ground to just get the smoke
I hide them under trees and put them on top of ATC towers to make them look like a blown up S?A

I hide them under trees and put them on top of ATC towers to make them look like a blown up S?A
S/A
but black flare should absolutely be a thing with no light emission. I just wanna spruce up some target cities with some visual interest and make it a little more obvious where the fighting is happening

Does anyone know if you can actually record the voices for wingmen yourself in missions, or is that still limited by the selection available? Thinking about making custom voice lines for a mission; but for wingmen, as well as for the story.
not for wingmen normal interactions (evading missiles and such)
but for specific events you can use custom radio chatter

@Joshua Marston did you rename or delete the original map?
No just update it
open the VTOL game directory 1. Inside the CustomMaps folder should be a folder with the name of your custom map (`map000_firstmap`?). Inside that folder should be a .vtm file with the exact same name (`map000_firstmap.vtm`?) 2. Inside the CustomScenarios folder (and then inside the Campaigns folder if it's a campaign) should be your custom mission. Look for the mission's .vts and open it in notepad. It should say `mapID = map000_firstmap` or whatever the actual name of your custom map is.

All three of these must match exactly

Does anybody here know why campaign names and descriptions arnt being saved in game but are being saved on the workshop page?
There's a known bug where clicking "save" sometimes doesn't save campaign name/description changes for some reason.

Hi there, It seems we can only set a 'destroy' objective on an enemy unit. Does anyone know if it's possible to set a static object as an objective ?
use a conditional objective
hmmm ok... haven't found this yet 😇  Can you elaborate ?

hmmm ok... haven't found this yet 😇  Can you elaborate ?
oooooh I guess I'll go to sleep a bit less stupid then
thanks 🙂

is there a way to open the mission editor without having to put on a headset?
yes
Main menu bottom right@Velocity Raptor

why wont my GPS targets show up in game? i sent waypoint to GPS for each waypoint and none of them show up
this is what i have
Is that a multiplayer mission?

Is that a multiplayer mission?
The waypoints are only added to GPS for players that are alive at the time it's fired. You have it firing at 0s after mission starts. Player are still fading out from the briefing room at that time, so no one is in their vehicles to receive it.
You usually need to wait 2-3 seconds to wait for the fadeout, but even then it would fail if a player starts the mission without picking a slot.

Next question what is the max height for either the Sam Missiles or Radar?
There’s not really a max height
Generally both radars and missiles do better against high targets

Could I fake it with logic?
fake what?
Is HC live? seems like website is down

Is HC live? seems like website is down
It never was up
oh

so how to setup HC?
It is not open to the public either
oh ok i see

@Sypwn, was it you who said you had a sizeable collection of dedicated servers?
I mean could you also like just have them on different ports?
and then use a proxy like nginx to forwards the different domain names to ports

I mean could you also like just have them on different ports?
and then use a proxy like nginx to forwards the different domain names to ports
For my services I do, and I have it behind nginx so I can map different domain names to internal services

Would you be breaking terms by running them simultaneously?
ahhh so the issue isnt ports but rather how many VTOL VR copies you have
yeah VM is probably the best solution to that

does HC and HS actually *rely* on the VTOL executables or is that just a restriction you made for copyright reasons?
Also we should go to #off-topic before Sypwn wakes up
fair

Just to confirm. If I set enemy AI with radar OFF they wont have use of Fox3's?
it seems unlikely that they can use fox3s
(Sorry got distracted yesterday) fake a max radar range or angle if possible

Hey! I'm making a mission which has a couple of hundreds of very similar objectives. The scenario then selects a random set of 9 of them. It's a pain to make all the objectives in the internal objective editor, but would be easy to copy and past in a text editor. 1. Any caveats with using an external text editor? 2. Is the vts file format actually conforming to some common file format which could be recognized and highlighted by a code editor?
The vts file format is a glorified .txt
You can use any text editor to edit it

Why don't you have these grouped into a single "6 selected" number alive check?
Honestly, its a personal choice, its better for me to understand at a glance. I do it alot in Engineering projects. Yes it would be cleaner to have 6 but ehh
Hey! Is this a bug? If I cancel a selected objective with "Cancel objective" action it stays visible on the objective screen. Pressing prev and then next on the screen removes it.

Hey! Is this a bug? If I cancel a selected objective with "Cancel objective" action it stays visible on the objective screen. Pressing prev and then next on the screen removes it.
The objective should change to a red colour on the objective screen. But a objective will only disappear if there is another objective after it.
Red color is for failed ones AFAIK.

Is there a convenient way to decouple workshop item description from in-game campaign description? I want to make a more in-depth description on Steam, but it does not make sense to have that in-game. So far the best option I can see is uploading with VTOL and manually editing the description on Steam, having the detailed one saves somewhere on GitHub.
Yeah. I just have a better description on steam
@Sypwn ok im here how do i do it

how do i make it so the round ends after a specific amount of enemies have been killed?
AI? Or players?
Players

does anyone have a spreadsheet with all the costs of attachments? just to give a feeling of how much budget to give
im sorry to ask this but how do you make a enemy team player? i cant seem to spawn a player for the enemy team
Did you create the mission as part of a multiplayer campaign?

Standalone missions are singleplayer

Hi everyone, what does this option do in the editor?
It means when the objective starts, all present players have their NAV points set to the selected waypoint.
I doubt it. Maybe @Strikeeaglechase . But few people touch that feature.

i also got 2 small questions that would be a lot of help for fanciness 1. how do i give players GPS coordinates. not waypoints 2. can i make an enemy blind/dormant? there is the "engage enemies" checkbox, but i dont believe that affects cruiser radar/SAMs?
> 1. how do i give players GPS coordinates. not waypoints It's an event action under System -> System. (Send Waypoint/Path to GPS?) But know that in MP it only affects players that are spawned in and alive when it activates.  > 2. can i make an enemy blind/dormant? there is the "engage enemies" checkbox, but i dont believe that affects cruiser radar/SAMs?  Yeah I think that's a bug. I need to report it. There's also the "Set non-targets" action, but that can be just as buggy.
1. ah, okay that explains it. so i have to set up a trigger to like 5 seconds so that they get it?  2. sad. i know that for the mobile ground radars (only mad 4 i guess) it is meant to not close in on enemies while still having the radar going

> ah, okay that explains it. so i have to set up a trigger to like 5 seconds so that they get it?  Yeah. Because players are still fading out from the briefing room for the first couple seconds, and some people don't pick their slots right away.

If I want to have a take off objective with allied group conditions, will it require the entire group for a true outcome or just however many of that group is spawned in?

Group conditionals usually start with  "Any..." or "All..."

so is not alive can also mean not spawned?
thanks for the help!
Only for human players in MP, yes

Has the issue with testing missions on oculus launch been resolved?
No. Just use steamvr

Unfortunate

I seem to be having a problem with enemy ground units not following the path i set does anyone know what could be causing this?
If the units are in a group, they will form up and follow the leader ignoring any other orders given.
You have to give them group action orders, or ungroup them

so any units that I want to patrol a path cannot be in a group correct?
They can, as long as they are all following it in formation
ok thank you

okay that works then XD I think for the simplicity of it will it work if i just dont set them to any group but have each convoy unit set to follow the path?
Each approach (grouped or ungrouped) has its pros and cons. You'll just have to experiment with both and decide what you think would be best for your needs.
Ok once again thank you for your expertise I'm going to be testing the "finished product" today and would be honored if you could join me

@BahamutoD or anyone else have a TL;DR explanation of exactly how units decide where to join a looping path?
If I had uploaded a test version of the mission/campaign to steam is there anyway to update that with the final version or do I just have to re-upload each version to the workshop
I can feel the frustration radiating off this post

is there a way to move spawns?
there's a Move Spawn trigger action
il look into that, thanks

is it possible to launch the editor without launching the game/VR?
yes
how do I do that?

how do I do that?
Start the game and it should be on the bottom right
That starts my VR, any way to do it without VR launching?

use the `oculus` launch option

Hey! Objectives have  "Completion reward" field. Do I assume correctly that it should add score to the team score but is just broken for now?
It adds to team (or player) budget but i dont think money currently works to limit what players can equip (might be wrong)
so... since I cannot despawn infantry, is there a way to make infantry disappear without killing them? specifically, this is for a mission I wanna make where the infantry has to go inside a building, and obviously.... they cant just be standing out there, outside the door. they actually have to go "inside" the building and not die.  so... help?

IIRC all units can just clip into a building
oh O_O I mean, that works...

i come to you again with another random question  is there any way to make an enemy plane carry an anti ship missile?
No
damn, what a shame

how "stupid" will the AI go when i set a designated target? will it only evade missiles and otherwise beeline the target? and what if i only set one of a group to do so? will the others follow them? (maybe thats a good time to ask how the AI determines wing leaders by default)
pretty much what you said
if its a formation lead aircraft, the following aircraft will go with it

and im guessing the AI just determines the "first created" as the lead? also, if the lead got a designated target, will the followers break off once you get close to them?
i think its the first assigned to the group
Group membership order is determined by the order you add the units to the group. You can see the current order here. (In this case, 12, 13, 11, 10)

hmm... that might be worth integrating into the story... and i got just the right place for them to try... whats their range?
it's complicated
oh no

WAIT i didnt have to set the waypoint/path of the entire group, just the leader this entire time then??
yeah but why would you not command the entire group
its way easier

how do i do this? i got their path set and now i want them to shoot at the carrier once they are at the final waypoint... im guessing its not "set priority target"?
For rocket boats, I think "Set priority target" is the best you can do
maybe you can place rocket arty on a carrier and it maybe wont slide off XD

do you know how many problems that would solve for me?
i am weapons to surpass metal gear
When I tried that with a carrier group they all phased into each other and followed the path single file instead of staying in formation

Now are they able to shoot?
How do you Inter developer camera I couldn’t get it to work lol
I guess my insert key is broke

@Strikeeaglechase do carriers and allied cruisers have something special that allows them to move ground units while carrying them?
yes
they have a moving platform component

don't suppose one of the other smaller enemy vessels has them?
very unlikely
idk why not, its not like its really an optimisation

boats use special net syncs right?
yes
They use the downloadData same as players iirc

Why do you care so much about the AI anyway?  Your workshop doesn't appear to have any non-test VTOL missions
what do you use all this knowledge for?
oh you know

what do you use all this knowledge for?
oh you know
*also airtraffic, random encounters, ai tweaks, ai debug*

but for what? or who? do you have a portfolio of CSA missions you've made? It's just odd to make all these tools for others when you doesn't seem to have a goal of using them yourself for something. Not trying to imply anything, I'm just really curious about your motivation.
my skillset includes writing code, my skillset does not include being good at level design
fair enough

I hear we have unit respawns now? Is this true?
in vtol 1.5, yes
you can currently access it through the public_testing branch

1.5 is happening? This is news to me
I've got a question. What exactly needs to be done for an objective to show up for a player? I'm trying to set an objective to reach a checkpoint, and so far have it trigger on proximity and set a new spawn location, and it works when I fly in the mission, but I don't actually see the objective pop up.
Do you get the objective in your objectives menu?

In game
I don't get it there no

Are you looking for the "new objective" popup at the top of the hud?
You should probably have the spawn movement be handled by an event rather than a trigger
like am I looking to have it pop up for the player? not necessarily, the only thing I care about is that you can see the marker on your HUD.

like am I looking to have it pop up for the player? not necessarily, the only thing I care about is that you can see the marker on your HUD.
The new objective popup only happens if the objective is created during gameplay
The Move Spawn action should be inside the Completed Event actions for the objective. No need for a separate triggered event.

OOOOOH, you mean the waypoint?
yea yea
you need to check the "Auto-set Waypoint" box in the objective

in completed event action of objective editor?
yes
right now I just have it enabling the trigger

is there a way to set specific enemy units not to be targeted without making them force undetected?
that's what I'm saying, skip the pointless extra trigger
"Set non-target" action?

so is the waypoint separate from the objective? Like do I need to still put the checkpoint in the exact spot as the objective for it to be a waypoint or will the objective be a waypoint in it's own
No, the objective waypoint is the center of the trigger
I think that's what you're asking

Are you trying to decouple the visible waypoint the player sees from the actual place they have to go? Use two different waypoints for them?
No, but they are two separate things so I was wondering if I could just skip the waypoint part
but as you've explained that's impossible

except if its a player? I think there's bugs with setting players as non-targets
Not a player
I'm curious, is there a list of planned features for 1.5 available?

I'm curious, is there a list of planned features for 1.5 available?
Planned, no. Already implemented? See the pinned messages in #public_testing
Baha very very rarely announces any future plans.

Baha very very rarely announces any future plans.
So now I've got another question. How do I make another objective become the waypoint for the player after the previous objective has been completed? It's not as simple as enabling Auto-set Waypoint is it?

So now I've got another question. How do I make another objective become the waypoint for the player after the previous objective has been completed? It's not as simple as enabling Auto-set Waypoint is it?
As long as the objectives fire in sequence (using prerequisite objectives or such), then yes it's that simple. If multiple objectives are active at the same time, then moving waypoints between them gets complicated.
ok so if I have 2 different objectives that are set to Auto-set Waypoint, do they both show up as a waypoint or does it pick one or the other?

ok so if I have 2 different objectives that are set to Auto-set Waypoint, do they both show up as a waypoint or does it pick one or the other?
the one that was activated most recently overrides the previous one
but players can anytime open their OBJ page and click the WPT button to set their current waypoint to any objective's waypoint, even if you didn't check "Auto-set waypoint"

so how do I trigger another objective to start once the previous one finishes? it doesn't seem obvious from the available actions in objective events.
set objective 2's Start Mode: Prerequesite
then check the box for objective 1 as the prereq

Is the mission count as complete once all objectives are done?
Once all __active__ and __Required__ objectives are done, yes.
If there are no active objectives at the start of the mission, it won't finish. But if there is at least 1 completed objective and no currently active required objectives, it completes.

is it possible to clone/duplicate a mission?
File -> Save As
just spent the last 4 hours making a simple mission, really gave me an appreciation for Dynamic Liberation lmao

Any kind of pattern with what aspects you don't like?
Usually the end goal is boring
Stuff like "Clear airbase to win"

Is there a way to force units in a sea group to spawn in their formation positions?
whoops bad reply
place them in their correct formation positions?

place them in their correct formation positions?
But uh, on that topic, you could simply copy the file
they always drift and I cry

So how does formation work for a group of 6?
1 23 456  I assume
It's always a V

how, without just removing and readding?
It allows a trigger to happen *every* time an event occurs, instead of only *the first time* an event occurs.  Every time the player goes above a certain altitude, something bad happens. Every time they respawn, they are invincible for x seconds. Every time they approach a friendly convoy, it resumes moving. Every time they fly away, it stops.
The possibilities are pretty insane

Does stopping  a timed event sequence pause it or stop and restart it?
I assumed stop and restart
stopping a timed event or an event sequence makes it impossible to resume or restart

This won't be the case in 1.5?
1.5 allows an event sequence to loop back to the beginning when it hits the end, instead of stop.
But that's it. Still can't restart dead sequences

How did you do that so fast? Was this already built?
or you could do this and give the objective a success condition of hold time == 30
I already had the 1.5 editor open, but otherwise no I'm just quick with making triggers 😛

If you already had it planned out I'm sure you could do it in a minute but on the fly? maybe not quite
also I didn't actually fill in the condition trees lol
Bruh :wkek:

Has there been any hint of text-from API in the mission editor?
what?
Advanced Programmer Interface, like proper scripting with text and copy paste so I can work faster and make less mistakes than I do dragging my mouse around from checkbox to checkbox

I mean are the base .vts files just default Unity serialization of the CustomScenario class? Cuz if so, moving it all to json might not even be the best move to make, for editability and all.
I don't know. Are the default unity serialization plain text?
Just go make a new scenario and look at one, lol

I don't know. Are the default unity serialization plain text?
Just go make a new scenario and look at one, lol
To be fair I also wrote a C# version

Because that's against the TOS?
Well I wouldn’t have put it on GitHub
Only reason that vts to json exists is I needed it for HC and figured it would be useful to other ppl

eta on mission editor update is like ? this spring or sooner than that?
there is no eta on anything, lol
ah man baha just needs to make the game more expensive its like giving a bunch of people a crack addiction and then not supplying more

with a proximity trigger on it as well?
for units to spawn for the encounter
im confused on where to put the chance in the logic is what i think im asking

oh for fucks sake they dont?
that explains a lot
is there a list of broken and working shit

Also, have you played shazmode?
I havent ever had a private MP experience
idk what shazmode is

Shazmode is in this campaign: <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2793994908> Dynamic Liberation AH-94 (and AV-42) only No enemy aircraft Clearing a sector moves your spawns to the next one
yucky ucky 42
pubs hate the 42 so no worries

Fly 60 minutes, get nailed by a random hidden manpad?
The other problem with realism is that we have magic IFF and no civilian faction.
more like fly 20 minutes and get shot down if your stupid

Has baha everattempted team work previously? Or hes just not open to it
I believe he's stated that he's not interested, and doesn't enjoy it.
And I can respect that

How would that work? Baha would basically have to open source the unity project lmao
well instead of making it a skill issue, work on the process so its easier for someone to create a custom unit or aircraft
like

My biggest question is *how*? What could be done to make it easier?
You literally just described CSA
yeah CSA makes it relatively easy for ai units

Has anyone actually asked Baha about that?
We've mentioned it a bunch of times without baha saying anything
:/

How would that work with things like team score and objectives tho?
oh wait hc doesnt support objectives anyway
nvm

Anyone know why I can’t see my custom mission/campaign when hosting an mp lobby? It’s set to multiplayer, I have spawn points and can launch the mission fine within the editor. I’m subscribed on steam and it’s installed but it doesn’t show up in the campaign selector when hosting a lobby
Quit the game, verify files, try again
Ok I’ll try that out

Are there any AI cruise missiles?
Some might classify the NMSS's SuperMissile as a cruise missile. But if you're asking about a big honkin missile that you can order AI to fire at ground targets, only the AGM-89/161 and only from Team A.
Ok so a "Vampire slayer" mission in which you have to kill a bunch of incoming anti ship missiles would have to be performed from Team B it seems

Do the order of key-value pairs in the `.vt*` files matter or will it read them in any order?
I assume they aren't required to be ordered
Nah order does not matter

or do you mean you can't find it in game?
I managed to find it
Can one use the giant airbase hangars and if so how?

Can one use the giant airbase hangars and if so how?
They should automatically open when you taxi up
Can you place aircraft inside

Best vr headset for this game?!
What's your budget
1000 euro maybe

But when is it coming?! Valve deckard?!
Idk
I don’t like the index

is it possible to have an MP spawn where if no one spawns there, a bot would spawn there?
you could pull that off with triggers
place both a player spawn and AI there, check if that player "is alive", if not spawn the AI.

so I just gotta hop on open beta and my mission will still work?
Otherwise it will only work the first time and never again
yeah thats what I assumed would happen

Im saying its not gonna break anything that is already in the game? I know ill have to update the radar logic
It should be fine
where is ptu changes pinned again?

where is ptu changes pinned again?
nvm
#public_testing

another question, what does enabling engage enemies do on the AEW-50 Bulwark. Does it provide BRAAA callouts for REDFOR? or does it make the AWACS lock up targets
uhhhh, I don't imagine it would do anything
yeah confused

does it have a "Radar Enabled" property?
yes
It launches fox 3's

What happens if you give an AWACS an Attack action order?
idk what happens
Im charging headset rn and building REDFOR CAP

REDFOR AI doesnt have a FOX 1?
I think they have one you can equip
nah, i think its just the heatseeking and semiactive radar missile, i cant remember their names ever

do you know which is which?
LOL yes
you got a fun mnemonic so i can remember them or something? XD

you got a fun mnemonic so i can remember them or something? XD
yeah, SRM stands for short range missile (IR), and MRM stands for medium range missile (FOX3) although MRM could probably be renamed to MRMSAR if Baha were to add a FOX-1 for REDFOR AI
then you would have MRMAR for FOX-1

also, I know there is a way for AI to prioritize targets. Does that queue in a priority list? example: GAV-25 takes off pathing to target A. when it gets to the end of its path it triggers enable engage for the GAV to prioritize target A. Then a player is detected by the GAV-25 and that triggers another prioritize target PLAYER. Will the GAV add the player to the queue or break off from its attack to intercept a player and then return to its original strike?
If you use "Add priority target", it will add the player to its pool of priority targets it can choose from. If you use "Set priority target", it will clear the pool of priority targets, and then add the player so it goes after that.
set priority target is what I need for the player proximity trigger then?

set priority target is what I need for the player proximity trigger then?
If you want it to break off at a certain point to attack the player, then resume attacking the original target, you'll need to use an Event Sequence to order it around
and I can use Player Is Not Alive to return him to his strike targets?

and I can use Player Is Not Alive to return him to his strike targets?
yeah, but once you Set priority target it will completely forget about attacking the previous target, even if the player is dead
okok sequence it is

set priority deletes the queue of targets, add priority targets adds it to the pool of targets it will attack, what does set designated and attack target do thats different?
priority targets will be attacked when they are spotted by normal means designated targets are revealed to that AI so they don't need to be spotted, and will be attacked regardless "attack target" overrides all other orders and they will attack a single target (then revert back to previous behavior when done)
okay so I need to use designated targets and attack target orders to have GAV-25's harass AH-94 pilots

attack target reverts to previous behavior which could be designated targets? so I could cut out the looping sequence?
okay so now my issue is making it individual per player. I dont want the GAV's to set attack on all players. Just the one or two that are getting too close
can I make a node for each player that will work independently or do I have to make a sequence for each player that could interfere with the GAV flight?

clicking "respawn able" means when the unit dies it automatically respawns?
I would guess so, but I've never tested mixing them before

The simplest solution is to make a sequence for each player, unfortunately. It is possible to do it single sequence with a Conditional Action, and a GV for each player, but that's probably more clicks.

is there a way to turn on collisions between aircraft? i feel like it was a thing at some point, but in my missions there are none
It is in singleplayer. But not in multiplayer
ah, thanks. thats what i was worried about

so where is the action to respawn when dead? Im having trouble finding it
Im going to loop for redundancies sake now
yeah per player seems like the most straightforward way

testers? more like testes amirite
No tester role so dosn't count
Baha plz

is Unit Group Is Any Near Waypoint broken?
😩 so many questions LOL
If the UnitGroup has players in it, yes. Use UnitList if you there are players involved.

are timed events repeatable if they are looped by a sequence?
also is there any way to have a flight take off and have it randomly pick between lets say 3 different looped paths. Once it chooses a path it runs that circuit until it detects an enemy aircraft. If it wins against the player, it returns to its circuit, if it get shot down it respawns, takes off, and the dice roll for choosing 1 of the 3 paths happens again
how the hell do you direct infantry to load into an AV-42C I think im blind

is there an issue with Player AV-42C's loading and unloading infantry or something?
could've sworn I once upon a time had an infantry group load into a vehicle all at once
idk if im just being stupid

always wondered how default behavior StayInRadius works, anyone know?
If the AV-42 are piloted by players, you have to create "Pick Up" objectives for them.
No

What do you mean exactly?
Normally you just need to complete all of a mission's required objectives
Dose completing all objectives pull up the end game panel?

Dose completing all objectives pull up the end game panel?
all objectives marked as required yes

another one from me, default behavior "takeoff" used on an aircraft does what? Do I have to build a taxi path for all AI aircraft or does the default behavior just autopath to whichever runway is closest?
they handle taxiing themselves
unless they are VTOL capable, in which case they will just take off straight up

so gav-25 requires a taxi path built if you want it to STOL?
after taxiing, they will follow their default path, or orbit their default waypoint
you don't need to build any taxi paths  If they are are on an airbase or carrier, and their TWR is too low for VTOL, they will automatically taxi to the runway for takeoff.

and what is that TWR?
Thrust to Weight Ratio  Heavy aircraft can't take off straight up because too heavy
You can see the TWR for AI aircraft on the equip tab

Lower fuel and loadout until it's.... 1.2 I think?
okokok
GAV-25s are suuuuuuuuper fuel efficient. The ones in Dyn Lib spawn with like 20% and flying from sector C -> A consumes less than half of that.

does a unit require engage enemies ON if I send that unit priority targets will it still engage them?
I want a UCAV to engage ground targets with its ATGM's but I don't want it to get distracted by players
Priority: yes it requires engage enemies on Designated: dunno "Attack target": no it will ignore engage enemies setting

ok but will the drone get distracted and attack players it detects even if it doesnt have its gun?
drone won't attack anything if it doesn't have a weapon, lol
As I understand it, for each type of target (air, ground, naval, stationary) the game has a list of weapons that are "highly effective", and a list of weapons that are "less effective".  AI will freely engage targets if they have a "highly effective" weapon against that target. So a fighter carrying a MRM or SRM will engage any hostile aircraft it detects, if engage enemies is on.  An AI aircraft will not always (not sure on details) engage enemies if they are only carrying "less effective" weapons against that target, but still can be ordered to attack that target manually.  An aircraft carrying unguided bombs won't normally attack a moving ship, but will if you set that ship as a designated target.

i guess slightly under 2.00 is realistic?
How do I change callsigns
Assign the players to a group

How can I set the target of rocket artillery in the mission editor?
Use a trigger action
Thanks

Can *single player* have it?
I’m probably just blanking
Wait…

Is it possible to measure lives left for a specific unit in the conditional editor?
I thought there was a condition to check remaining lives...
It checks for the whole team, and can't be used to measure a specific player

@Sypwn when Im sending a GPS point via system. Target Group is what? the GPS group?
Anyone interested in playtesting a PVE Vietnam War multiplayer map I've been working on?
Don't know. Test it and see what happens. Honestly I thought you would have done that by now instead of waiting for my answer.

Im just messin around, I need more time to test

People ask me "How are you so good with computers?" or "How are you so knowledgeable about the mission editor?"
Me:
I push every button and flip every switch to see what happens, then put it back together when I break it.
fuck I consider testing each gameplay mechanic I want to add but same time most of the conditional logic and event sequences Im doing are making the AI slightly more intelligent.  Honestly a Mission Editor Handbook wouldn't be a terrible idea especially with specifics like Unit Group has issues dealing with Players etc.

how the send waypoint to GPS trigger's "Target Group" property works?
That would be better to put in https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor/Events
Some of the features pertaining to 1.5. Ig we need to do more testing to see whats possible though...

Is looping removed currently due to the first node skipped bug?
No, looping was reworked (at my request) to be less confusing. To make a sequence loop, use the new sequence "Restart" action.
I could kiss you

Of course the real reason I pleaded was because the ol' `while` method would have turned this #mission_editor channel into a madhouse of "Why won't my sequence work right?" x8365
Restart only restarts the node or the entire sequence though?
entire sequence

Restart only restarts the node or the entire sequence though?
entire sequence
(it should, not actually tested yet)

is this what convinced Baha?
part of it, yeah
programerless behaviour

where tf is it? Im in PTE and Im looking in system
but, actually, I feel like the standard is that the programmer words have to mean the things they do, because thats how most level editors work, cause most level editors were made by programmers
if thats actually how while worked, used to work that is a bit silly

anyway to make mp missions for friends without uploading them to steam workshop? tried putting them in everyones customscenarios folder but they dont show up when hosting the mission
you can upload them and make it unlisted, that way only people with a link can see it
i think then i would still have to have mission content follow the rules of steam workshop

hmm well disregarding that part, if multiple people work on the mission, everyone of us would have to upload it themself yes before anyone of us can playtest it?, are there issues with beeing subbed to multiple missions with same name/etc?
wtf are you uploading lmao
:FloppaFlushed:

does workshop content have to be compatible with the base game, or can they be mod compatible only?
oh, is it just copyrighted music?
yep from bakrus

oh, is it just copyrighted music?
yep from bakrus
thats fine lmao

is the music even an issue?
wasnt there a version check when you join a server?
🤷‍♂️

you can do addition and subtraction now, is that not enough?
You can't add GV to GV
you can only add constant to GV

Where do the new spawn slot labels show up?
even if you did do what I was thinking, the number of 'ticks' required to do it would mess up everything
And I'm not just waiting for a pipe dream. Baha teased the most awesome thing but hasn't added it yet

Is there a char limit for the descriptions?
30
30 I think

remove the library and re-add it?
unless you install everything to the steam directory of course
restarting it worked this time, I was too fast to complain

@Sypwn are you going to be updating dynlib with the new 1.5 features?
or did you already do that
Some of them. I'll add slot descriptions and loadout recommendations real soon. For the trigger stuff, I'm not sure yet.

Does anyone know of a way to count the number of active players in a match?
Unit List (select all players) Num Alive
Sorry I should specify

Next question: can AI still jump over edges if their path goes through it?
Here for instance, would it jump from the ground to the platform?
I think it will vertically displace up to a certain limit. Although maybe not if it's an overhang like that.

is the recommended just a standard equipment layout upon enter a vehicle slot that they can change?
yes I should add a quickload kit for each spawn then
yes but the equipment is already on the hardpoint

does anybody know the distance of the mpa-155s arty fire?
very big
no clue, you have to find out by trial and error

Before I go insane, is this really the only way to do this?
It's taken me ages, even with file editing
These are relatively simple as they are a single action

Why did you have to do this 8 times?
For each individual player
if(playerX > radius) -> Murder them

couldn't you make a sequence containing only those 8 actions, and restart *that* sequence each time you need to restart them all?
use sequences as functions
That's what this is yes

yeah, but I thought you were complaining about having to create 8x8=64 restart actions?
No, just the lack of foreach loops
oh, yeah welcome to VTEdit

is it event sequence logic?
Yes
Conditions run BEFORE I spawn

have you looked at your player log?
I have done extensive enough testing that I've ruled it down to timings
I can get around them, with timers specifically

Is there a way to set the position of a carrier? I'm trying to randomize where the players carrier group spawns at
you can use alternate spawns, no?
with the new update is it only sequence's that can be reset because i cant seem to get triggers to go off more than once

Correct. But sequences can take the place of the other trigger types.

@BrianAnim we just tried to play podrace and it's all broken - No countdown at the start - Spawn points don't move - No enemies at the top of the canyon - "Someone has won the race" (I think it was supposed to say who?)
I'm new to mission editing and I had a pretty basic question I couldn't seem to find when searching online or on here... How do you designate units and bases to a specific team? It doesn't seem like Enemy is Team B, but rather the AI enemy faction? I'm trying to make a PvP mission and this is really throwing me for a bit of a loop....
If you want it PVP you need to make the mission a multiplayer mission first

Then you can assign AI to either side

How do I assign AI to a side?
enemy units are team b
thats just how it is

So then if I wanted to have AI jets for Team B, they would use the ASF's?
yes
and Team B can use enemy bases while Team A can use allied bases?

and Team B can use enemy bases while Team A can use allied bases?
yes
awesome, thanks for the help!

I don't suppose there's a way to make an AI hostile to both sides?
nope
Dang... I was really hoping lol

what about for static units like Radar and SAMs? I want to try and create a trigger that'll have them swap sides
noooope
Noooooooo my idea.. lol

Is there an easier way to set an objective that requires you to stay in a zone for a period of time to complete? For example, you have to fly inside of a 5 km radius zone for 10 seconds before completing, but if you fly out of it, it resets the obj timer. The only way I can think of is chaining together delayed triggers, wasn't sure what the  best way to do this is
no but you can decide how long before an action is triggered in a sequence. Example: you could have a Pick Up mission for AV42C. The mission only completes once the troops are loaded. Now create an event sequence that tells the Troops to board the AV42C when it is landed and within proximity of a waypoint but delay it for however long you want a player to remain landed for + the travel time of the Troops pathing to the AV42C and loading. Then the objective will complete
In a part of the map far away from the campaign, you could spawn an infantry when player near waypoint, set the infantry to move a certain distance to an objective, then have when infantry at objective then: insert command. Having the infantry respawnable and killed when the timer is up

So I made a few hours of changes to a mission I've been working on this morning. I don't know what happened but I closed out of Vtol and left for a bit. When I came back and loaded up my mission in the editor none of my updates seem to be there from the changes I made and saved today. however I uploaded my changes to the steam workshop and it all seems to be there and okay. I've heard there's a way to retrieve your own missions from the workshop and convert them back to .vts files etc to pull up in the mission editor. can someone help me with that so I can get the changes I've made back into my mission files on my end?

So I have this certain mission and many people can't figure out that a requirement in the mission is to stay low, what action can I use to warn individual players flying too high they are about to have a bad time?
put "DON'T FLY ABOVE ROOFTOPS" as the slot description for every slot
Im glad im not the only using slot descriptions as an alternative to briefings

Do you think that's sufficient?  Many people don't read text unless it's right in front of their face.
And the slot text is in front of their face
it will be in front of their face, many many times

is the "throttle" control message applied to the collective?
nvm "combat collective"
Those dont work in MP IIRC

Are running tutorial messages applied to new joining clients?
no
You can run a loop and detect when people become alive then show the message later (and as I learned yesterday, with a wee bit of delay)

wouldn't the result be idiot messages for everyone then?
You can do it for every individual player
You can do it for each *slot*, but not for each player

first off, how did you get these audio files?
recorded them with audacity
ok, are you using BGM or comms actions?

What is the range of the mad-4 radar? I want to make a path for the AWACS, but I don't want it to get too close.
success condition
55km but it will ping, spike, and range targets beyond that

Instead of setting the Loiter Begin Objective action, why not set Take Off to be a prereq of Loiter?
also 55km is arbitrary it all depends on launch parameters
right, I'll just put it about 70 km out.

Maybe something's up with your Loiter objective, I don't have much exp yet in this so don't take my word for it, but everything looks fine. Do you complete or fail the mission after take off?
complete
if I continue the mission all my objectives after take off work correctly

is it a singleplayer mission with forced equips enabled?
yes that would be why wouldnt it
🙂

more questions: is there any way to change the limited equips mid mission? like have an event where player completes and objective and as a reward unlocks the ability to use certain weapons
@Sypwn you can re-alive slots right? cause if true, you can have slots that are limited and slots that are not
and then give a live to the slot you want unlocked

@Sypwn you can re-alive slots right? cause if true, you can have slots that are limited and slots that are not

Wish you could limit equips based on the rearm point instead of the slot. Then you could have stuff like FARPs be able to equip less than a full airfield or carrier

How long does the smoke last on dead units?

awesome man thanks a ton!
How do I rasie the spawn off the ground

scroll wheel (or is it ctrl-scroll or something?)
or enter a new altitude in those boxes in the bottom right corner of the editor
then once your editor cursor is in the air, move the spawn point

how do i make an enemy player?
make it a team B player spawn
Where is that option

do we have general range of the agm-89 fired from surface level?

I think that's @drmedwurst275's map
Update is great - but can someone give an example where the respawnable option would be used pls. I wanted to have 'enemy' leave buildings - move on a path towards another building - and assuming the player didn't kill them they would then enter the building they have run to. Destroying them leaves a body on the floor. Is the above possible now - and does the new respawnable option enable the above scenario. Thanks.

Here I am with another question 🙂  How exactly do I set up a proper loop?  For context, here is the purpose for the loop:  I want ally aircraft to respawn at the airbase after they have been shot down. same for enemies. if they get shot down, there will be a 60 second cooldown, they they respawn and take off and head to battle.  currently I have that much going using the event sequencer. I set he event sequence to "start immediately" and the delay to 5 seconds just for testing purposes. as I remember, I set the ally aircraft to be spawned in at mission start, and the event sequencer just checks if the ally plane has been destroyed or not. the entry condition checks if it's alive. if its not, I set a "spawn" event followed by a "restart event sequence" event, all in one node.  however... when the ally plane dies, they spawn in IMMEDIATELY, without any delay. The delay timer doesnt seem to do anything in the event sequencer.  am I doing something wrong?
Can you screenshot the sequence?
Yeah, definately. gimme a moment to grab it

Can you screenshot the sequence?
Yeah, definately. gimme a moment to grab it
The delay occurs before the entry condition

ooohhhhh, I see... So I kinda gotta make it a 2-node sequence then. the actual spawning and restart will be in the second node, and the first one will be, for all intents and purposes, the "delay" (so to say0, cos it'll wait for the exit condition before heading onto node 2?
yeah that's one way to do it. Put the entry condition in the first node (leave the rest of it empty), and keep the delay on the second node
you can add to budget through events and stuff, but can you subtract from enemy budget?

you can add to budget through events and stuff, but can you subtract from enemy budget?
would be cool if you could have PvP missions where blowing up a strategic target caused the enemy to be less capable due to budget shortage

I have a quick question, so i tested my mission out and when i got to a certain objective it completed the mission even though there were still  3 objectives left, and i put them all on required, does anyone know what could be happening?
Did the required objectives show up on the MFD page at the time the mission ended?
yes and no, when the mission ended no other objectives were displayed until one of the aircraft i made triggered the next objective

Did the required objectives show up on the MFD page at the time the mission ended?
yes and no, when the mission ended no other objectives were displayed until one of the aircraft i made triggered the next objective
which then showed up

when i click on the link it is the "what are alt spawns?" paragraph is that the one you are refering to?
oh the wiki is weird, scroll up one line
okay

it also says that if the enemy completed their objectives but i havent set any up for them could that be a problem?
The player.log spits out a block of text every time it checks for mission completion. That might be useful to look at.
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

does anyone know exactly how "infAmmoReloadDelay" works?
okay thank you
does it reload only once it is all empty or periodically

The objective titled "Fly to waypoint" is completing, and there are no other objectives active at the time. It looks like you're starting another objective "Destroy enemy AA" immediately after, but it's too late. How is that second objective being started?
I just added this paragraph to my FAQ > Be careful to keep a "Required" objective open at all times until you want the mission to end. The intended method to do this is to use Prerequisite Objective Start Types, so that completing one objective immediately starts another. You can also put an Objective -> Start actions inside another objective's Completion and Failed actions section. Or you can have one "Required" objective that sits in the background for the whole mission, and is completed only at the very end.
It is being triggered by the waypoint proximity of the Fly to waypoint, as soon as they get in the proximity of the trigger, the next objective starts but then it says mission complete

so there is a separate proximity trigger that starts the second objective?
Yes, the fly to objective has its own proximity detecter and then i have a seperate one to start the next objective
but that prob isnt neccessary now

Does the Alt Spawn is rerolled on each Respawn?
no
you have to use a Conditional Action of Chances and Force Alt Spawn actions to re-roll it manually.

@Sypwn what does the Start Immediately checkbox do?  if its not checked the event sequence has to be triggered before an entry condition can be met yes?
if its not checked, the sequence won't do anything until it's started by another action
ok so it works how i thought it did I was just having issues with some of my sequences starting too early

oh, because you have to restart the game so frequently?
yeah
though I think I figured it out I gotta change the value AND the minimums to allow for negative values

> I have it set on a per life basis Shouldn't you need to set it to per team basis then?
I haven't messed around with the budget stuff, but as I understand per life mode means the budget resets every respawn.
it does

is the moderator role really worth our pain in the editor?
lol
*the tester role sure is* 👀

oh god are we turning this into the modding channel too, where there is no topic?
*absolutely*
we should stop, I enjoy this channel

Can someone please tell me how i create a Bullseye Point for a Multiplayer Mission?
its in scenario info in the mission editor
you create a waypoint, call it "bullseye" or something

what's going wrong? Log shows sequence restarting and all 3 nodes firing, but message 1 never reappears
Try making the duration of the first message ever so slightly slower
like 1.9 seconds

put my dummy node (no actions) back in at front and sequence works properly again - get msg 1 then msg 2 then msg 1, msg 2 etc etc. I'm surprised this hasn't been picked up before. lots of people have been using Restart in sequence  unless it is some weird situation with system actions one after the other in sequence?!
@Sypwn just seeking advice pls and noting my earlier misameanor "Did you just completely ignore what I told Monarch directly above?"   I'm happy to put things in VTOL Issues, but what's the difference between a bug and an issue? Is #public_testing reserved for issues (bugs) related to the most recent release? And thread vtolvr-issues for other issues/bugs ... just asking.   I have identified 'issue/bug' with Restart - see last few posts. I guess it should go to  vtolvr -issues2
Interesting. This was actually a bug in v1.5.0p16 (one of the testing builds) that it would skip the first node after restart, but that was fixed for the release, and I haven't had any problems. I won't have access to VR until sometime tomorrow.  If you make a new blank mission on Akutan and just add a player spawn and that sequence, does it still happen? If so please make a new thread on #vtolvr-bugs and include that mission's vts file.

I want to copy a multiplayer mission I have for the same campaign. Namely a dogfighting mission, one with guns and the other with guns'n'heaters. How do I copy it correctly because just changing the folder and file name replaces the other mission in the editor?

duplicate the physical folder
then alter its name

It that something easily figured in the editor?
🤷 I normally don't use the editor maybe @Scralar knows
Aight I'll keep my eyes open here. Cheers dude

its my first time playing around with the ships movement in formation, anyone know a way to get them to move in formation without having to make a path for every ship?
@Sypwn
You can assign them all to a group, then order the group to move to waypoints, they will move in formation if you move them via unit groups

Is there a way to randomise music that plays during a mission? Just a random thought, but... I think it could be an interesting to do in some non-story based missions or pvp missions.
Use the "chance" condition to play the music
wait, that works on music? And a bunch of songs set at 25 percent wont try to... work against eachother?

if the box was already checked, yes. But otherwise the box is not present to be checked.

Did that FAQ answer your question?
Testing atm
Yes, it helped tremendously, thanks again

did akutan and simple 3 node sequence as suggested  and it worked fine!! went back to my original and it worked fine as well ... go figure. Your reference to fix in v1.5.0p16 might be the clue. I hadn't played VTOL for while and software might have been pre p16 then subsequently updated? I checked this time and i'm now p19. Is there a list somewhere of the p releases and dates? I can only find 1.5.x updates on steam. thks for assist!
you shouldn't be on p# anything right now. You need to switch to the stable branch.
1.5.2 is out on stable

Why? I've been on PTB for about 3 years. is there particular reason I should switch?
Because ptb is currently out of date. The 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 fixes were never pushed to ptb. Also, you never play multiplayer??
Oh didn't realise Stable was passed PTB - I'll change. Played multiplayer on my own when first released to see what it was like ... each time in somebody just shot me down - no warning no messages no nothing. Haven't been back since - might think about it again.

How do you enable the Gunner Seat in the Mission Editor for the Apache?  "Select the MP spawn in the editor and set the seats up to 2" Is that Slots or am i trippin bc i aint finding sth called seats
thanks
Did you create the mission as part of a multiplayer campaign? I'm guessing you made a singleplayer mission instead.

Did you create the mission as part of a multiplayer campaign? I'm guessing you made a singleplayer mission instead.
yes
To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign. 2. Import your mission into that campaign via the campaign editor. 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer via the campaign editor.

Looking at the other channel, it had alt spawns before? Perhaps you hadonly enabled the second seat on Alt Spawn 2?
I'll take the silence as meaning it's fixed.
yes but now i cant load in

Other players? So you're hosting this for real, not just testing from the editor?
No
I've seen this before...

what VR headset do you have connected? This log doesn't seem to have any
Now I see why you have "bug hunter" I'm your bio
💀  Oculust Quest 2

And you're trying to select your slot and stuff in VR, right? You can't use the mouse in the briefing room.
mouse? from pc?
nah that not there

Was this log was taken immediately after you got stuck?
Or did you, like, restart the game after that
I may be reading it wrong, but this long only appears to have you starting the game, opening a custom mission in the editor, and nothing else. Nothing to indicate you tested the mission.

Anyone got a minute to help me with some mission editor basics? Im trying to setup what I think is a fairly unique version of a strike mission but Im new. I would love a mentor to hop in voice. Here is a sneak peak!
you should probably be using the weight function built into alt spawns
I thought that'd work.... but then the fighters also just choose one single alt spawn and never ghoose any of the others ever again 😦

Are you forcing alt spawn and spawning them all within the same action block? You should separate it by a tiny delay. Force alt spawn, delay 0.1s, spawn units.
Also to create an even 3-way split with Conditional Actions you need to make the conditions: If (chance 33) Else if (chance 50) Else
my power went off so im gonna have to try it tomorrow, but I did take some screensgots of how my setup looks

did you find the fix to this? i have the same issue
I need someone to provide their player.log file immediately after hosting a mission and clicking start mission. Or I need to set back up my VR, but I'm too lazy
lemme do that rq

something related to an objective?
OH
i set a blank objective i think

yeah how many objectives do you have?
1
blank

@[SPF]_CAPTPhilipp™ do you have any incomplete objectives with big red text at the top?
yeah i  give up
not on the using the brain part but the time it takes to go back to the editor lmao

big map with lots of city area?
yeah probably bigger than it needs to be for a few planes flying next to each other terribly
City area is a huge hit on load times. You can trim it down and repack the map

I'm just learning the mission editor and I didn't see an option to switch a base from red to blue. Is it possible to switch the alliance of a base in real time?
I was planning to do a capture the base type of mission.
There's an event action to change it

<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ> Just added two new questions: Q: How can I re-roll new alt spawn locations when I respawn units? Q: How do I make a random chance of something happening?
Question, I'm trying to allow for player choice in drop off objectives. So I have multiple drop off objectives targeting the same units. When I go to drop off the units, all the objectives get completed at once, where as I only want the one I actually complete to finish. Is this a bug?
isnt that conditonal?

like

Did u see that in the editor while my mission was loaded ?
How would I go about making "or" conditions. I want to make a strike mission where you have to destroy the targets OR kill all of the enemy aircraft so its kinda like a strike mission and TDM at the same time
do I set all objectives to not required since you can complete the mission without doing all objectives

What triggers a game to end? All required obj are completed?
yep
all required objectives for that team anyway

I seem to be having an issue with StaticObject references in the new 1.5.2. Haven't noticed this issue in previous versions. I am curious if anyone is experiencing the problem as well? When making a StaticObject reference inside the conditional editor my list of StaticObjects is just coming up blank even though I have StaticObjects.
I have tried to restart the game but no good still.
I noticed that only oil platforms are able to be referenced

Im now convinced that the issues I was having yesterday with the "force alt spawn" and wanting the units to respawn at random positions was infact bugged... because I now have the 2 fighters respawning consistantly and randomly, as I want them... in ways that the game doesnt really... account for.  think I should make a bug report? its, if i can truly confirm it, a fairly complex bug.  Posting this here, cos I believe its still a mission editor related thing, until later when I make a bug post.
Ah ok, thanks, good to know
same problem i checked what you told but there was nothing

is there way to transport infantry?
using units and not the AV42C
walking

I have two drop off objectives targeting the same units. When I go to fulfill one, both of them complete together, even though I'm clearly not fulfilling the other. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
sounds like it, but I'd have to see them to be sure
@Sypwn how does the MPA 155 work? because it says it only fires on a position when commanded to but how do you tell it to shoot and tell it where to shoot?

@Sypwn how does the MPA 155 work? because it says it only fires on a position when commanded to but how do you tell it to shoot and tell it where to shoot?
trigger actions
You could probably have ai despawn near a vehicle, have the vehicle drive to the drop off and respawn the infantry

Can the HB-106 attack and kill a carrier?
Not easily
how about 20?

so ive just started making missions, how do I make a unit attack a specific spot?
Im trying to get HB-106's to attack an airbase
add a waypoint

Is it just the bullsharks that can attack a carrier?
seems like dyn lib uses those as carrier cap threats
ASF-30 can as well, if you give them bombs and explicitly order them to attack it.

I've read the advice about making old missions multiplayer compatible except that I'm stuck with the step of "import your mission into that campaign" from which screen am I able to import a mission?
From the campaign editor for a **singleplayer campaign**, there's a button that says "import".
when a unit is respawnable, does it still need to be manually respawned after it was killed?

Yes
Functionality question: Can someone go into detail about the "unit detected" parameter in logic windows? My main thing is figuring out if it is persistent or not. For example: Player is detected by a radar system only for a moment. Later, the radar system is destroyed and no units are detecting the player- if I call a "unit detected" parameter following the radar destruction, will it print as true of false?

Normally a unit's "detected" status persists for the rest of their life. But Baha just added a "gets detected now" condition for players.
so that prints true of false if the player is within view ranges at the time of the conditional firing?

I believe he renamed the old condition to "was ever detected" which is more accurate to the original functionally
Also, number alive doesn't count stuff unspawned right?

Also, number alive doesn't count stuff unspawned right?
it didn't prior to 1.5. not sure if that changed
i.e. if I use it as the win objective (number of enemy forces alive is 0), that should be fine?

i.e. if I use it as the win objective (number of enemy forces alive is 0), that should be fine?
AI units that have never spawned in are considered alive
I see

it's different for player units, though, right?
cuz i made that work once
Best workaround is to use "num near waypoint" with a radius that covers the whole map. That will only count units that are presently alive

What's the best way to get ground units to follow a path in formation?
Put them in a group, other that group to follow the path
how can i  put a oil rig in, i once was able to now i cant

Do the WR-25 Rocket Pods sink carrier?

Hey, I think I've found a bug related to the mission editor but I'm not sure. let me check if you guys know anything about it first. It's a bit hard to describe but when you have player's MPspawns with lives and some other player spawns without lives, when you have all players switch to the new spawns that had no lives by adding lives to them, then set the lives of the aircraft they started with to zero it prevents players from joining even if there are free slots. it say's the lobby is full, even if you have it set to allow joining in progress. I've got a 6 player mission that has each player moving to 3 other aircraft as the mission progresses removing lives of their previous tier aircraft and adding lives to the next. once all lives get removed from the first aircraft and lives get added to the second aircraft for players to switch to, it seems like that's the point that the game someone stops letting people join the mission in progress. sorry for that being so long winded, not sure how else to describe it. anyone know what might be going on there?
No clue, not having the same issue
@Sypwn

ok so it will just restart itself? destroying the vehicle doesnt even happen?
Yeah I know....
but when the player is not near WPT 20,000m it doesn't destroy the vehicle

basically saying include a global value for the game to reference when deciding to kill a player. so both conditions are met. Is Not Near WPT and global value = 0 it will kill the player?
no, that was just for me to prevent people from taking off before a race
ok so youre saying add a altitude maximum?

ok so youre saying add a altitude maximum?
no lol. Its just an example of what i did
that was to prevent people from skipping parts of the race by forcing them to stay low

do you send it immediately at game start?
yes but I also send it whenever a player dies
so you can always see the BFM arena boundaries

what are you using as the ball?
No ball, had to be a little creative. You have to land a 1000lb dumb bomb on a tiny bunker perched on a spike to score. I took away the TGP because you could cheat with it lol
LOL

so camp by the goal and wait 1 minute?
Yep
LOL

i believe it works for gps bombs set to dumb mode? idk

To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Why would the plane be able to CCPR off of a TGP point, but not off a GPS point?
because it means that dumb bombs are in a Low Tech mode without the TGP\
mission design basically

so i think we agree?
no I have no idea what you are talking about
Arbitarailly less accurate when its a GPS point vs when its a TGP point?

Arbitarailly less accurate when its a GPS point vs when its a TGP point?
a point is a point, the aircraft shouldnt be magically more or less accurate
nonono you misunderstand me

> the bomb just doesnt have a terminal guidance phase arent dumb bombs unguided anyway tho?
yes but we have found out that you cannot CCRP a dumb bomb without a tgp
yes ok?

quick question how do i add allied units to enemy team? for example i want to place an assault carrier on team b but i cant, theres only the nfp one
you cannot do that
fr?

you dropped a TGP assisted CCRP dumb bomb recently?
idk bout recently bur sure
Why would it be any harder than with the TGP?

Why would it be any harder than with the TGP?
Dropping off the TGP and dropping off the GPS should be identical
it wouldn't you would just have more situational awareness with the TGP. Lets say the GPS target isn't sent to you and you have to place it manually thats a lot easier with a tgp compared to trying to mark a gps point in the nav map when the target is force undetected

you are simply saying its harder to get a GPS point than a TGP point?
yeah which is why I said we agree like 10 messages ago LOL add a CCRP mode for dumb bombs via GPS
this is what confused me

Does anyone here have any clue on how to make the AWACS work in the mission editor? I've got it set to take off and circle an orbit point, turn on its radar and have open communications. Am I missing something? he still comes back as if its not on station when requesting a bogey dope, RTB vector, etc.
how do you set rocket arty targets
there's an action to fire at waypoint

is there a way to set it for a squad instead of a single unit?
yes, put all the artillery in a unit group
i did

are there any other types of units in that group?
no
Oh, you're right. It's not there, and never was. My bad.

anybody have any advice on how to make the AWACS work in a multiplayer scenario?
Just curious... before I make a proper bug report, does anyone else have issues where F-26 fighters can only take off once from carriers?   If you made them respawn, once respawed, they cannot take off from the carrier anymore and this is what the player log gives me:  -11752858 ModuleEngine.SetPower(0) -11752858 ModuleEngine.SetPower(1) -11752858 ModuleEngine.ToggleEngine() to False F/A-26B [38] requesting takeoff. F/A-26B [38] no runway for takeoff. -11755596 ModuleEngine.SetPower(0) -11755596 ModuleEngine.SetPower(1) -11755596 ModuleEngine.ToggleEngine() to False F/A-26B [37] requesting takeoff. F/A-26B [37] no runway for takeoff.  Take note, they do take off just fine the first time.
That seems likely to be a bug, when you post it make sure to include a full log file (and a vts file if possible)

Can I get a screenshot of its settings

try removing the engage enmys?
I have events that set it to take off and circle the orbit point. Ok I'll try that
and fly wit it

it climbs to 33,000 feet and starts its orbit. I'm thing my waypoint is the issue. Maybe I set it too high in the air?
thats pretty high what height does the alt warn in the jets start
is it 30k or 40k

i swear its 40k so 30k for an AWACS should be fine(?)
its 40k, i have the default altitude and orbit altitude set to 10k and it just ignores it and climbs
I deleted it and the events and remade them all, going to try it now

Does anyone know how to set the visibility for a map I uploaded to public?

Is there a way to check if there are no enemies near a waypoint? I thought I might be able to use trigger event (Proximity, AnyEnemy, OnExit). But enemy units being destroyed don't trigger the event.
Use a conditional trigger event, not proximity
UnitList (select all enemies) num near wpt equals 0

Got another question for one of you wizards, I have a conditional trigger event, when tank is not alive, spawn tank. If you kill the tank it spawns again, but only once.  I thought maybe once the trigger condition is met, perhaps its no longer enabled. So I tried setting the trigger event to enable itself after spawning the tank - that didn't work either. Ideas?

how on earth do i setup ground artillery to fire on a waypoint? do i really have to manually create an event for every single one of them?
also, when making enemy planes take off, can i just set them on orbit when placing them in the hangars and, once i want them to have them take off so they will automatically move to their orbit waypoint without anymore input?  the way i have been doing it is set them to parked, then make them take off and have a second conditional event telling them to orbit once taken off
Yes

so theres no real better way to set things up like this?
That's it my dude.
welp, at least it does work

Hello there ! Does anyone has already made a scenario with infinite ammo ? I would have thought it'll take few days for variation of missions with infinite ammo to appear in multiplayer but I haven't seen any...
Anyone know if objectives that have been cancelled can be triggered again?    Say I want to start an objective, then cancel, then restart, then cancel.. so on.    Use-case: signaling directives for air superiority pvp missions (defend CAP, retake the CAP)
I think so

restarts just stop the event in its tracks and restart it i believe

why is the AWACS in my mission just responding with unable to everything? it is orbiting a point with radar and comms turned on. do i need to turn engage enemies on?
also my MAD4s dont start deployed anymore? do i use the event "park now"? or is it engage enemies
Is there some easier way to test longer MP missions? I usually set ammo to infinite and slog through until I get to the objective, only to find a bug and have to restart

Do people set custom triggers or something to override mission objectives to test?

Engage enemies for radar units is, IIRC, the same as "radar tracking". You need to have both on

Yeah. Or create the mission as a SP mission (so you can use the devcam gun and fast-fowarding), then convert it to MP after the triggers are tested.

Its not possible to convert MP back to SP is it?
Officially, no. But it's pretty straightforward if you already know how to do vts editing.
Alrighty, cool. Is there any good resources for VTS editing anywhere? I assume its like editing text documents and such?

Thankyou again

If ally fighters are set to "parked" and dont automatically take off, how can you make them take off, without setting a trigger?  here's my scenario: I want wingmen to be on standby on the ground. they will only take off if you actively call for your wingmen via "form up" or something like that... but if they are set to "parked" in their unit settings, nothing can get them to take off, unless you made an event or trigger that makes them take off.
you can tell ai wingmen to take off with the comms menu im pretty sure
I thought about the same, but... I dint actually see any take off command there. only refuel, rtb, rtb & refuel

So my soccer mode is nearly perfect, but there is one bug I am trying to fix.  How would I create a delayed respawn? For example a bunker is destroyed by a bomb and I want it to respawn 20 seconds after being destroyed. Currently it instantly respawns after being destroyed. This causes a rare issue where if two attackers drop bombs that are on target it allows their team to score 2 points in one round.
Anyone free to help test something? Look for Shamebird's lobby. PVP Miami map.
Top gun maverick mission 0-0

Is this about right or am I all wrong? This is a tad confusing to me lol sorry
I changed the exit condition "or" to "and" because both goals should be alive
Yeah, then restart the event sequence after a delay of 20 seconds

The time delay should be in the first or second node?
(Im doing 60 seconds for testing purposes)
2nd node

Any idea why that might be?
Where does the delayed goal respawn event get triggered?
Nvm then

Where does the delayed goal respawn event get triggered?
Nvm then
Its triggered by the completion of each objective

Does each objective complete when a bunker is destroyed?
Yes
the same bunker

Ok and set it to begin immediately?
Yes
But also add a 20 second delay on the first node

So thats all that would be needed?
You also need to delay the start of the next objective otherwise it all starts instantly
Ah gotcha

How would you go about doing that with my existing framework?
It's pretty difficult. I have made a similar mission easier and I just used event sequences for most of it
What if i switched from pre req to triggered and started the next mission with the respawn delay

So I'm having an issue in trying to set up a mission. I can't get allies or enemies to follow paths. Is there a good guide on doing it? I draw the path with points, have the vehicles spawn right next to it, set them to 'path' (and I've tried 'railpath') and they don't move at all.
Wondering if it has to be a 'only one vehicle can use the path' thing, and I need to set the rest to follow...? (Haven't used follow yet tho)
Oh hi Urban

Forced alt spawn index is 1 based right?
It starts at 1, yes
but internally, and in the player log, they start at -1 for...reasons.

Does anyone know the character limit per briefing page?
And per objective page
Nm. Found a rough estimate

Is there a dev log or console I can bring up whilst viewing dev cam? Some way to peek into the guts of a mission to see whats firing off?
I imagine not but I thought I'd ask just in case
https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/mfg6inev/ it's a mod but it's the closest thing we have

Alright, is there any reason, that all my AI and events wont work or fire off? E.g. SAM wont have radar, no AI do what the initial events say.
I've restarted my game, thought it could be that
No objectives, radio response

so my awacs was still not responding after setting it to "engage enemies". it was sharing its data trough data link, however it would not speak to us at all.  i had set him up to just take off. he then defaulted to orbiting his default waypoint. maybe he was still in "take off" behavior and would not respond? i set up an event now to properly change his behavior to orbit his waypoint after takeoff now, will test later if that fixes it
Alright, I'm working on an air-to-air mission. I want the enemy planes to spawn in after the player(s) get within a certain distance of a waypoint. Figured out how to make the trigger event, but how do I make it so the enemy planes don't spawn in *until* the player crosses that point?
Do I just uncheck 'spawn immediately' on all the units?

Do you have any objectives with missing properties?
I suspect its this in the player log
let me check

What units are members of EnemyEcho?
The log shows this is actually a problem with a unitgroup
yeah, but its for the ai wing leader code

hey fellas, I see that 'Alt Spawns' are designed for AI units, but has anyone figured out a way to make them work for player aircraft? I'm looking to utilize the ability to change loadouts from the altspawn feature for players, so a movespawn won't do in this situation as I can't adjust loadouts directly with those. Does anyone know if there's a clever way to accomplish this via vts editing or some other method, or am I out of luck using altspawns to set various loadouts throughout my mission in vtol's current state?
You have to use different player spawns
Each player spawn is associated one loadout, whether forced or not

Does it need to be a DM? Can we just make a thread?
sure, that will work.
Looking at the IComparer.Compare() bug, its kinda weird this hasn't broken the game completely

Something to do with enemy seagroup Mike I think?
In reference to everything else
Nvm i think this is it

Can I turn a path in the editor into a path in the GPS so it shows up on the NAV page? I have a small mission where the player can shoot some targets and go for a canyon run.
I think you have to use waypoints
I think that paths are only for AI

If I check for units like this, is there a way to check their height aswell?
I think you have to do it individually
Or use an objective fly to instead

Is there a way to respawn destroyed units? I got an event set to "Spawn All" but that only spawned units, that were not spawned before.
Spawn all respawns them if they are destroyed also
Can I check somewhere if that trigger actually triggered?

in the player.log
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

I would assume an event can be triggered multiple times, correct?
if i sart a timed event does it continue to go untill i tel it to stop?
yes

if i sart a timed event does it continue to go untill i tel it to stop?
yes
oof

does what i dicsribed work?
not at all
oof

set a time delay for the event and then just tigger it after evry objective complete?
does this work @Sypwn?
wait no

Did you start the sequence or check "start immediately"? Did you check the "respawnable" box in the unit's properties?
one sec
slight goof

How would one go about creating a objective matrix that can have any group of 22 Groups of 4 infantry land at any 22 bases, without having to drop all 22 groups at one base, and without all 22 objectives completing at once due to a minimum of 4 infantry being dropped off at a single objective waypoint?  (I've already created an entire framework of events that react to any base being taken by any group, and leveling from short to long range, who owns it, etc.. This is just the last piece, and I can't think through it currently)  Fixed it: I eneded up using a event sequence of 2 minutes, that cancled the objective, reset it, then begain it, that was only fired by a conditinal event that had a condition of: All unit groups: IS NOT: Near waypoint (waypoint) distance.  then ran into a bug where if you set a rally point, and the infantry park at the rally, they couldnt be set a path or interacted with at all, so ended up moving the rally point to a diffrent than the drop off location waypoint to make everything work.
I think ISEGaming has experience with multiple dropoff points for infantry, but I don't want to ping them at 2AM EST.
I don't know enough about pickup/dropoff mechanics to offer a recommendation.

so setting the AWACS to orbit also didnt help. quick recap on my problem: the AWACS in my mission will only respond with "negative" or the likes. he does however share his data via data link. he is set to engage enemies, comms enabled and also orbit a waypoint.  going back to my older missions, the AWACS there also doesnt work anymore. is this an issue with a update?
I've had the same exact issue for over a week and yesterday I hopped into the premade F-45 mission and the AWACS did the same thing so I'd say it's a bug introduced with the update
How does the ship formation system work?

Is it normal that, upon takeoff, f 45 wingmen do not automatically form up on you? or is there an event I gotta add?

I'd it's single side multi-player, you could save as... (name) Make a single player one, replace the single player with the .vts of the multi-player?
Idk if that would work though
Depends on how the game reads the file structures

It's on the wiki I imagine? (I'm checking anyways, rhetorical question)
I mention it in my tips article <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_tips>
I see, thank you.

Is it intended that if you put multiple ground units into a group they stop following their given path?
Hei guys 🙂 i made a little mission and wanted to test it. It has 7 basic objectives with lots of targets during a night time operation. It is nothing special but up to 15 people can fly together. Any tips on how to test it properly?
Fly it solo (if possible) before getting other people involved. It's quite frustrating to get a group together only for the mission to completely break 5 mins in.

You can't bulk kill units with a group?  like for example:  Allied: Group Bravo               Action: Kill all *Wouldn't* actually kill them?
L
I have a bomber set to fly along a path and deploy 8 ASMs, but in game it opens the doors, deploys one ASM, keeps flying the path with its doors open, turns around when it hits the end of the path and circles around before deploying another. How do I make it shoot off a volley?

I tried removing the path and allowing it to freely orbit a point within deployment range. It now deploys one missile and orbits with its doors open until either given another order or shot down. I have also tried spacing out the deployments with five second sequence delays.  No luck.
i dont think its possible

How is performance on 16 players PVE missions, still hard on the host?
Generally, yes
Does anyone know the damage that the ground units do to each other and the health of them?

Does anyone know the damage that the ground units do to each other and the health of them?
it's almost like you still have to netsync the state of all those units to everyone lol (if that was a "how is it still" vs. "is it still")
@Sypwn or anybody that can answer my question, when making units invincible via trigger events, what does the little checkmark beside it that says invincible do?

You use the same action to set invincible and remove invincible
The check box tells it which one you're doing

Question, is it possible to edit a workshop multiplayer mission in the mission editor?
Only if you are the creator
Ok, good.

what does "force detected" do in the editor?
Makes that unit show up on NAV to the enemy, regardless of if they've actually been seen or not.
Note it does NOT show up on the F-45 HUD/TSD because of a technicality. But it does show up on all units NAV page.

if i do that, woould it be viable to use the nav screen to use gps guided munitions?
im trying to make it so if you do recon in the previous mission, you do an easier version of the mission in which you have the targets gps locations
The player can indeed use it to manually create a GPS point based on location of the unit on NAV. But if that's your intent, you might as well also send them the GPS data directly.

hey. is there a way i can force an eject to a player and then end the mission successfully??
In SP? Not that I can think of
wanted to have a mission end with you ejecting and the next mission is to protect a group of heli to rescue said pilot

In SP? Not that I can think of

do i need to do this for each target?

do i need to do this for each target?
yeah
ah

and then make a dif event for each?
Not an entire event, just another action
ah

how do i make it send, do i need to do somthing to make it send at spawn?
Only players that are alive and in their cockpit at the time will receive the GPS coords. So you have to work around that
at what time though?

can i make diffrent gps groups send?
like one for radars, one for iraps, one for bunkers?
People wonder why all the custom missions are so similar with cookie cutter objectives. Then they try to use the mission editor and discover all the limitations.

yeah

sypwn, two questions.  if i complete a mission then eject it will still pass right?
two how to force eject or to force win a mission
I think that's the number you specify in the action properties

but if you win a mission you can still eject without loosing ???
Once the mission ends, its outcome cannot be changed
👍

is it me or does the f-45 have way superior AI and parameters than literally all the enemy units?  2x f-45 vs 2x asf-33 and the ASF units get absolutely descimated, sometimes without a single f-45 loss. this is repeatable... quite a lot.  2x f-45 vs 2x asf-58, same deal, if anything, the asf-58 planes fare even worse.  for a multiplayer game where both teams have some AI units flying around, as im trying to make, this makes it extremely unfair for one team, giving a large disadvantage to one team, and a big advantage to the other. it makes it so the mission I wanna make is kinda impossible to make
I'll see if I can confirm this tomorrow, i've been struggling with this for over an hour. I hope its just me being tired, but if this really is the case, I guess I simply cannot make the mission then
asmrm-7s are pretty dogshit, especially compared to 120ds

wonder if the asf-30 would be a more fair balance?
prob asf-30 or maaybe 33 yeah
I figured the lower thrust of the other two would give it a disadvantage

i mean you could just give team b more numbers, no?
I could, but there is a score counter that keeps track of team kills. first team to x kills win.  I mean, I probably could change the goals a bit
The AH-94 Proficiency Test mission has an objective to escort a tank under fire. It's actually invincible except when it gets really close to an enemy the player hasn't killed.

well having ai v ai count for that might not be the best anyway? idk
could probably set up a way for team b ai deaths to count as less tho..
true. but that does still mean one team will have more enemy AI targets shooting at them

Im trying to test a mission scenario im creating and when I go to load into the map from the loadout/briefing room it my view goes black and it freezes. I assume it is crashing or stuck loading infinitely. Any idea how to fix it?

ah ok interesting. How were you able to see that? Is there an error report in the log? that way if something happens again i can find it

aaah sweet. Thanks! ill try that

Oh boy, what exactly happens when I repair it? Obviously updating it to the latest build and such, my last update was just before 1.5.5
It corrects the mission and campaign metadata.
Before anyone asks, I do have it backed up online and as a ZIP, so I am fine if it royally borks it. But I did find some new trigger bugs I gotta fix

is there a way to make a group of ships follow a single path in a formation? Or do you have to make a parallel path for every ship unit to follow individually?
if you put them in a group, and order the UnitGroup to follow the path, they will use a Vee formation.
oh cool thanks!

Can the trigger events be re-enabled once they fire off to be used as a loop? Or do i need to make use of the sequence?
Okay, nevermind, but another question arose. When using event sequences, do all of the nodes check their entry condition, or only the nodes before which another nodes have fired off? To put in another terms: Do nodes need to fire before another node for it to fire?
is it like if then if then if then...  or more like if {} if {} if {} if {} .... ?

They will enable a single time per conditions met So  if: unit: alive Then: kill  If unit: is not: alive  Then: spawn  Would lead to an infinite loop

how could I make a singleplayer mission for a modded aircraft such as mirage 2k or gav-25?
Theoretically you open the mission editor with that mod active, and the vehicle should show up as an option
or would that break on the workshop

okay but I could send the raw files for the modded mission to another player and it could work?
yeah
dope

is there a way to make tunnels in the map editor?
i tried lowering roads but it didnt seem to work?
no

i tried lowering roads but it didnt seem to work?

akutan is just quirky that way

i plan to make use of this new respawnable setting just gonna figure out how it works does it work through an event/trigger? or when i tick it on lets say a bomber if he dies does spawn back in a set time
and lets say if we captured an airbase where he respawns id have to trigger an event to stop it

Im trying to make a engage enemies toggle event. as of right now I'm using the fuel port as the toggle switch. its supposed to set a unit group to attack the player when open and toggle them off when its closed. as well as tell teh player they have been toggled to passive or hostile with a tutorial message. but when i toggle the fuel port switch it doesn't do anything?
any tips?
Cockpit controls don't work in multiplayer

What are you trying to accomplish tho?
damn
i wanted to make a lobby for me and friends to practice shooting at AI jets that are default not aggressive but then have the ability to toggle them to become aggressive at any time with a switch in the plane

@Strikeeaglechase @THE GREAT OVERLORD OF ALL CHEESE do you know if radars or launchers have minimum engagement ranges? And if so, what they are? I have a SLAM truck linked to a SAM S/A Radar and it only seems to lock+fire within a very narrow range window.
Yes some have min-range, ill check what its set to for the slam truck
1km

is there something else I can try so balance a red vs blue team mission where one team's AI (the blue team) just doesn have MASSIVELY better specs and destroys the other team? balancing is pretty much impossible when the AI f-26 takes 2 missile hits to destroy and every red AI plane takes only one, and gets out maneuvered (asf-30 vs f 26 has a 1;6 kill ratio in the f26's favor.)
not beyond what I've already suggested
only somewhat balanced fight is f45 vs asf33, and the f46 is, arguably, not even a fighter

what channel does he watch? never really saw a suggestion channel. cos having AI planes of the same types on both teams would solve the multiplayer issue instantly (both sides can have asf planes for Ai and both can have F series planes as AI)
oh thats damn true, lol
#vtolvrdev ?

thanks for the info guys. Ill... I guess post the idea there? cos I really reached my limit of what I can do with the mission I wanted to make.

Hey another question, Is there a way to choose your spawn point between a few areas WITHOUT adding additional planes/ players?   (IE: I want to have One type of each aircraft that the player picks and then give them a choice where that plane spawns in.)

You can use multiple slots to represent each spawn location, and with fancy trigger work make them mutually exclusive so you don't raise the player cap. ```Alpha 1-1 - Spawns on Airbase A Alpha 1-2 - Spawns on Airbase B Alpha 1-3 - Spawns on Airbase C Bravo 1-1 - Spawns on Airbase A Bravo 1-2 - Spawns on Airbase B Bravo 1-3 - Spawns on Airbase C``` As soon as Alpha 1-1 spawns in, Alpha 1-2 and 1-3 are locked out. As soon as Bravo 1-2 spawns in, Bravo 1-1 and 1-3 are locked out. etc

What are the units in the vehicle speeds? I.E is fast 30 30 kts, 30 kmh?
m/s i believe
Editor units are all in metric

Are units in a group?
not sure
the gunboats are for sure cause there's 3

and the completed event is when the obj is done correct?
yes
how far is this radius 10? does it mean 10k?

So I made a basic 1v1 MP mission for a friend and I to practice missile avoidance. How do I set it up to where we can play together? Do I upload to workshop and add it like a regular workshop mission?
if it's a MP campaign then yep just upload it and run it like any mission

Hey y'all I just have a quick question.   Is it possible for vehicles during the initial spawn to be in cold spawn mode, but in subsequent respawns, have them in flight ready mode? Or is it just one or the other for the whole mission?
If its on a moving carrier, no. Otherwise, yeah just "move" the spawn to the same location but change it to hot start. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#movespawn>
alright cool thank you! I'll check that out now

does anyone here have experience with AI using Aim-9e missiles? im not sure if im doing something wrong, but f-26 AI simply refuses to use those missiles. and they barely use guns too, even if placed right behind a non-engaging red aircraft. they just kinda dance around wildly and never aim, then disengage, take a WIDE circle and do the same thing.  asf-30's however, they use their rear aspect missiles and guns PLENTY.  possible bug, or am i missing something in the editor?  if its a bug, i'll make a report tomorrow when my power is back on.
Yeah that sounds like a bug
I rarely touch Team A AI units

The bigger question is, how did you miss the pinned FAQ link?
you're right.
@Sypwn moderator colour change??

That renders mission base names useless, right? I was going to use it to change the name with ownership change in a campaign. It's not a huge deal. I'll just pick a name and stick with it.
how do i select multiple units at a time to copy them
you can't

Out of curiosity, why are you trying to copy a group of units?
The only time I would have found that particularly useful was before unit respawning was added.  Otherwise single unit copying covers most of what I need.
*Triggers, however...*

triggers and events can't be copied right?
Only by doing it manually in the vts file.
i’m making an old tech a2a battle cuz i can’t find any and have never made a mission so i thought it would be fun, but i want to copy a squadron and place them in a different location

Are the different members of the squadron different types of aircraft?
If not, copy one unit to the new location, change its group, then copy that unit to fill the rest of the squad
i’ll add more aircraft and different aircraft as you progress

this was supposed to work, right? but it keeps adding funds every 5 seconds even if the unit is alive, after the first entry.. c'mon i can't be that dumb can i?
if i put a friendly aircraft in my aircraft group (alpha, etc..) with they fly with me and follow my commands?
Only in singleplayer missions

if i put a friendly aircraft in my aircraft group (alpha, etc..) with they fly with me and follow my commands?
Only in singleplayer missions
doesnt necessarily needs to be in the same group. you choose "force player commands" in the unit

Which condition is that you're showing? I see two entry conditions
first one
what's the second one?

You said the trigger fires continually even if ASF-33 [19] was never killed?
after the first kill, it continues to fire repeatedly even after the unit respawn
Now I'm trying to remember how Alive checks work for respawning AI units...

is initial delay in seconds or minutes?
seconds
great thanks

Is it a SP standalone mission, SP campaign, or MP campaign?
hey how do you make someting spawn the same time as you
like you die right

an AI will spawn with you, how do you do that?
If you need to do it once, a conditional event
If you need to do it multiple times, a looping event sequence

can you post a screenshot of what you have now?
yeah just wait a sec
and the event sequence?

But what's this attached to? A conditional event?
i was ussing trigger events not sequence
ah

So the problem is you want the AI to spawn in when you spawn in (after 5 deaths), but instead it's spawning it when you die (after 5 deaths)?
yes
exactly

do I just put nothing in node 1?
Just an exit condition, nothing else
This FAQ answer may also be a helpful read: <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#sequenceorder>

did you disable or delete the old conditional trigger?
not when I spawned
yeahh

should I put start inmediatly?
yeah
didnt work

can you drop your player log?
how do I do that?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

If you start your MP3 player while mission BGM is playing, your MP3 player will override and stop the custom BGM (instead of playing both at the same time). If you then pause the MP3 player, it won't resume the BGM, so the result is nothing is playing anymore.

Can you make a radar seek an individual target, and ignore others?'
With AI? No I don't believe so

you tried commands via comms page?
yeah
cuz ive just tested this 5 min ago

Are they in a group?
I tried. Can you share how.
Check the "respawnable" box and then trigger the spawn action after they die

How do i tell the group to follow the path?
All i want them to do is keep moving.
There's an event action UnitGroup -> Name of group -> Follow path (or something like that)

Are there any plans to make the mission and map editors compatible with 4K displays? Right now the UI is scaled for 1080p resolution, and everything is almost frustratingly small to click on.
Not that I'm aware
Okay then, no worries.

Is it possible to display a message to only one player or selected players? It seems that you can either displayy a message for everyone on a team or to everyone in the game (on both teams)
Nope
Damn it!

But it shows that to everyone or everyone on the team right?
Shows to everyone
I will explain what I have made and maybe one of you brilliant minds can help me with the last puzzle piece: I have essentially create an Among Us game mode. There are 4 players, each game one of them is chosen at random to be the "alien". If the alien dies or If all 3 humans die the game ends. This is all working properly. However, I do not currently have a way to let the alien know that they are the alien while not telling the humans who the alien is.

they spawn in differente locations?
do they see each other on spawn?
They will show up on NAV. No way to prevent that

do they see each other on spawn?
They will show up on NAV. No way to prevent that
i don't know if it's the smartest solution, but the first thing that ocurred to me is use a 'flare' in front of the players blue for humans red for alien for example for 5 seconds

may i ask how u did it?
oh yeah, chances. ok
Yes using chances but I also had to make it to where there is a max limit of imposters and there is always that amount

How do you make a multiplayer mission?

ill link it in a bit, mission

in the objective editor if you set it to "final" for start does it not appear until all other objectives are complete?
Correct
Hi! I'm trying to figure out how to make your wingman land at whatever airbase the player is at, and then take off when the player doea something like start their engines. I've tried using a conditional event and a waypoint event to land the wingman. The problem is that the wingman won't take off again even if the takeoff event is triggered

How many points can a path handle, what would be recommended?
I have paths with hundreds of points
okay great

Is it possible for different vehicles to have different RTB way points at the same time?
afaik you can't, but you should be able to change the waypoint with triggers
Okay, thanks

Also, I have enemy planes on a carrier, and have the 'engage enemies' box checked, but when I engage the strike group, the planes don't launch to engage in the battle. Is there a way to make them engage?
Order them to take off with trigger actions
you can make it conditional on the player getting close

How could I do that?
You're lucky I have the editor open already (forgot to increase the radius to something reasonable)
But you should really try to figure things out yourself first

quick question regarding BGM: There is a "play bgm" event that I can use to play music, but how can I cycle between songs, instead of just looping the same song over and over?  wondering if im missing something
Does playing a different BGM not stop the previous one?
My guess is you just tell it to play a different BGM, but I haven't tried it myself.

<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ> Added: Q: How do I make a ground unit follow the road? Q: Can I despawn or teleport AI units?
Wow, after struggling for a bit I finally figured out everything needed to make it so you can have troops pre-spawned and perform a load/unload sequence.  Here's what you need along with the entry conditions needed for it to transition correctly. Without the first entry conditional, (is not landed), the aircraft will orbit its takeoff location. If the second conditional is excluded, the troops will not unload from the craft.
already figured it out but thanks

Does anyone know how to make a wingman land and take off with the player?
Can you RE-trigger a timed event? Or is it just objectives that can now be reset? Thanks.

Is there a way to track if someone has ejected in the mission editor? Having "ejected" as a trigger condition?  I'm working on mission with CSAR aspects, so that if you're shot down you have to go pick up your pilot before you can get back into the action. I'd like to be able to track if someone successfully ejected or not and give them different pickup objectives accordingly.
nope

Like how? Every time I use the land command, I can't get the wingman to take back off

Like how? Every time I use the land command, I can't get the wingman to take back off
Oh, not sure why they wouldn't take off when ordered to
I've tried using both conditional and proximity events. It seems that once a wingman has landed and powered down, they won't power back on

its not ideal but you could spawn in new ones?
ideally this should work tho
they should be able to take off again

@Sypwn even if I use the "player is not landed" condition?
I guess what I'm asking here is what defines the "landed" condition?
Wheels touching the ground

Same for wingmen?

I want to leave aircraft as props. I set their default behavior to parked and unchecked "engage enemies." Is that good?
Was late last night and didn't get to test it. I'm at work rn
Yeah. Just be aware that enemy units will still attack those "props" if they get the opportunity

Like, using attack target actions to force blue on blue? I planned to test that later.
yep, but it wont work if the aircraft has missile equiped, it will attempt to attack the target with missiles, but either the radar, the missile, or some part of the missile attack routine has a friendly fire check, so it will never launch
bummer

Is there any reason my tanks aren't moving?
I've been trying all day and they won't move
Switch from rail path to path

Is there any other change?
I had it set to path earlier and it wasn’t working, so I tried railpath
Try ordering the entire group to follow the path using a timed event

Wait... how do you give both teams in MP a KC49?
you can't
...oh

m
and we don't have a conditional inversion?

Wait, why can I only put down 1 enemy spawn for a pvp mission?  I thought each spawn was where each slot/vehicle would spawn?

Question guys. Is BGM in missions limited in volume? I really want to have loud bgm, but even at 100% volume in settings, it's really quiet, even if I amplify the absolute ass out of it in audacity.
The same goes for "sound effects," I can't find a viable way to make it sound like anything is loud enough to give it an actual meaningful affect in-game. If anybody has any tips lmk
You can't rely on BGM for anything serious to the mission. Many players have it turned off in the game options, either for preference, or so they can safely stream the game.

Quick question regarding the radar of the f-26 vs the asf-30...  the map im making is a 200x200km map, however the f-26 planes detect and engage planes that are more than 3/4rds of the map away. thats 3 times more than the asf-30 planes can even dream of detecting planes from... so its really impossible for me to isolate squadrons to certain parts of the map without events.  is that a bug?   cos right now, I need to figure out a way to force every single plane undetected for the f-26 AI, as well as make them get destroyed, ontop of the event that destroys them at 50 percent ehalth, cos they tank missiles, lol....  if this is a bug and not just me missing something, ill make a bug report tomorrow.
I should probably add: I flew in a f-26 in formation with the AI f-26... and they outranged my own radar by a looooot as well
the ASF-30s radar is about 20% worse than the 26b's (inverse square law prob means its *range* is less than 20% different, but thats output power), the AI 26b has an identical radar to the player radar

Are you sure they are getting targets on radar and aren't just turning to them via RWR?
we were waaayyyy out of RWR range as well (I got no RWR until we got way closer, like half the distance?).   when I flew on the red team with the asf-30's,, we (eventually) got within RWR range, but the asf-30's had zero response and even turned away from the very quickly approaching f-26's
so yeah, im... gonna play around tomorrow a bit and see just... what's going on. I could honestly just be making a mistake

Yeah just looking at their stats I don't see why they would behave differently

Question regarding non target lists.  If I add non-targets to a fighter group... does that persist through their death? meaning if I respawn the group - does that list persist or do I need to re-action that?
I think it does for a group. Not sure about individual units though
But you should test it

In a sequence - Does the delay happen before the entry condition.  Does the delay happen before the action? When one node finishes... does it immediately do the delay on the next node? or fire the node then delay? I'm just confused on where the delay takes place.

No, not without mods. You could always use SAMs but they arent the same

I'm building a mission and like to add a tunnel like in the first map, but I see no options in the map editor to do this . Is this possible?
it is not, the game uses height maps to generate it's terrain which don't allow holes to get poked into them
the original map "akutan" was made without the use of heightmaps

In one of the recent updates, the developer, stated that you can use loops in the sequence editor, has anyone figure how to do this?
Ive kinda confirmed its a bug. the moment I put a certain event in for the enemy group, the f 26 will spot the asf 30 at 129km out.  the moment I remove the event, the f-26 will detect normally.  the event in question is to just add "orbit point" and set it to "none" and leave the altitude and radius values as is. that, somehow, forces the asf-30 to be detected.  I took a video and I'll make a proper bug report in a few minutes.  Edit: now im just confused, as I test it more. cos it seems it isnt the orbit event, but rather the fact that the asf turned really hard that made the f 26 see it. but even so, that makes little sense cos there are zero RWR spikes....
Ok, yeah. it isnt a bug with radars or detection ranges or anything likt that. its literally just that the f-26 detects you way before you recieve an RWR warning, if you make hard turns.  asf-30 doesnt detect you at all, but the moment you have an rwr warning and you turn really hard/show your rear end, he detects you.  so yeah... F-26 radar range extends past its rwr range...? which doesnt quite make sense, but that does actually explain things

does it have to do with the fact that if you turn you expose more of your aircraft?

Is it possible to spawn in a player AV-42 with soldiers already inside?

Is it possible to spawn in a player AV-42 with soldiers already inside?
I think so?
Should be an option at the top of the AV42's properties window

is it possible to edit that in via the VTS file?
I wouldn't try it. If it's disabled in MP, that's probably for a reason.
I think I remember discussing this before, and Chase confirmed it wasn't synced or something.

put the infantry there to be picked up?
or put them wherever the player spawns
I think I'll just have the AV-42 spawn at the platform

where did you want it to spawn before?
it's possible to edit the VTS to spawn infantry on the deck of a carrier
Oh?

How would you go about spawning infantry on the deck of a carrier?
create waypoints where you want the infantry, then copy those waypoint positions into the infantry's positions
After you attach the AV-42 to the carrier deck, you can use that position as a reference point

does if matter if the carrier is moving?
you have to do it before the carrier starts moving
ok and to get the infantry to get into the player AV-42 it's just the same as as if they were on the ground?

ok and to get the infantry to get into the player AV-42 it's just the same as as if they were on the ground?

Is there a way to unlock a specific "weapon loadout" mid mission? (Ie: after unit x spawns --> allow agm 88 to be chosen in load out. )
You'd have to have a separate slot that starts with 0 lives, and add lives later to unlock the slot and the weapons it can access.
You can then lock out the old slots forcing the players to pick the new one at next respawn.

So I tried using system > sendwpt to gps as well as send path to gps neither of which show up in my GPS when I start the game. Does this maybe only work for single player?

the word "gps" dosen't show up there

When I reset objectives, then set another objective to "begin objective" the auto-set waypoint dosen't take effect. I'm assuming to make it like it was never started to begin with I would need to "cancel objective" first?
Other way around, reset, then cancle objective, then have something "begin" it does the trick
Did this end up working out?

Did this end up working out?
Yup it worked just fine from my testing
Just know that if you have multiple av42s it can be tricky to make sure that the specific infantry you want goes into the right plane. As there isn’t much room on the flight deck

Can you trigger an event of an objective being complete? I dont see it as a condition in the logic
Put the action inside the objective's completed event
Oh I see I was thinking backwards putting the objective in the event, ty

Just want to verify there is no way to change the budget in a multiplayer mission during the mission? I wanted to have a budget reward per kill/objective, but from what I am reading that does not work?

Question: how much health does the different planes have?  every single other plane dies when taking a direct missile hit (as you'd expect) except the f/a-26... if thats a bug, I have taken a recording of it and will make a report, but I wanna make sure if its intended before I actually do that.
> every single other plane dies when taking a direct missile hit (as you'd expect) except the f/a-26 Iv seen the F-45 tank missiles many more times than iv seen 26b's, unless you mean AI?
^ I've seen the F-45 tank multiple heaters 😄

for AI iv exported their relevent stats here https://canary.discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/1029607562598948965

In these stats, the f/a-26b has its "wingrightpart" health at 50, but its "wingleftpart" is at 1... why is that? just curious.  also, sorry if this discussion might need to go to the dev channel        "health": 50,       "minDamage": 0,       "name": "wingRightPart"
 and        "health": 1,       "minDamage": 0,       "name": "wingLeftPart"
> why is that Dunno maybe baha meant to update all of em but got sidetracked
I don't think its meant to be like that lol

ah, lol, fair, fair.  huh... Yeah, I guess im gonna have to use a workaround? but then again, the asf-30 has 40 health, same as the f26, according to the .json's

I've created about 10+ missions and having a blast. However I'm not trying to get enemies to spawn with a trigger. I set the enemy units on the spawn immediately not checked and then use a trigger to spawn unit.  It doesn't seem to be working. Amy I missing something? Is it just those two things? not spawn immediately and then use a trigger to spawn it?
You've got it. Can you send a screenshot of the trigger you're using.

Question: what triggers "auto rearm" in AI units?  Specifically, how low on ammunition does a unit need to get before they go rearm? because I have to add a few bombs to some AI units to bring their weight up, but those bombs will never get used. im afraid that since the plane will always have those bombs on it, that Auto rearm will not trigger
Also, during rearm, do ai units also refuel external fuel tanks, and re-equip them if jetissoned?  seems like an odd question, but heres my reasoning: Players have to manually re-equip stuff they jetissoned. if jetissoned, thyey are no longer "part of your loadout" due to the whole pylon being yeeted.  as for refueling external fuel tanks... if it is still on the plane and not "fired" like a regular missile (no empty, yet present, pylon) then does the AI actually have the knowledge to realize "hey-ho, the internal fuel is now refueled, now its the external tanks' turn!"
Currently there is a bug within the mission editor in which certain triggered events only show for the Host, while timed events show up for everyone in the server. I am using this bug to my advantage to be able to send messages to the host only during missions, but i fear that when the bug is fixed i will lose this mechanic.

Recommended weapon loadouts not saving in mp mission. Is this a known issue? Set up 4 FA26 with cruise missiles and and a 65' on pylon 1 and 10 - but it won't save the agm 65s only the cruise missiles. Tried padlocks open and closed and various combos.? Any one else had this. Thanks
"Won't save" meaning if you save, exit the editor, and open it back up, those slots show no overrides?
for some reason it skipped over the first node enitrely and immediatly played the second node, can i have a little help?

Best to test and find out.

Tried it on new missions/maps same issue - then (should have done this before...) checked game files integrity - 82 files with issues re-acquired. When 100% OK made a new vanilla map - v small island - one base - only way I could get the loadout on any aircraft type I placed as a mp spawn to show in briefing room was to lock the padlock on that slot. Any open slots with stuff I wanted to just recommend still didn't show in the briefing. I made sure all weapons were 'available' and  tried on a carrier (where I found the issue) and on land air bases - nothing sorted it. Got the green recommended loadout modal far left of loadout screen but nothing showing unless I padlocked it in the editor. I'm on stable branch. Appreciate you checking you don't have the same issue - not sure what to do next - other than just leave it. Does anyone else reading this have, or has had the same issue?
> Any open slots with stuff I wanted to just recommend still didn't show in the briefing You clicked "load recommended" and nothing happened?  Can you send me the .vts file?
@Hrallil when adding units, there is an option at the top to switch between Allied and Enemy units

I.. dont see any

oo... is there another editor for units ?
After you've created and saved the map, you then need to create a mission and select that map
ooooooo isee

Is there a way to make it so the allied ground units can’t kill enemy ground units but can still attack each other?
yeah just make them all invunerable
wont work if you need aircraft to take them out tho

It shows a lot of other things too. It's pinned for reference.
so this sequence is triggered by a completed objective, which also stops another sequence currently playing music. the stop music thing works properly but it instantly skips goes to peacekeeper loop and skips over peacekeeper initial. I've tried adding a delay to peacekeeper loop but it just plays peace keeper intial then instantly skips over it the momment the delay is over

I made a loop = true path type bezier for a formation of carriers, but everyone stops after a while.  How can I troubleshoot this?
So they follow the path for a while, then stop?
yes, I think it might be back at the start of the loop

Are you ordering them to follow it as a group using a trigger? Or are you using default behaviors?

they are assigned to a group and appear to hold formation

does mp vs single player make a difference?  How about sub-orbital mp spawn heights?
*sub-orbital?*
yeah, asking for a friend.  He wants to know if 100,000 - 200,000m spawn heights will break the path loop

Can you create a single player campaign then convert to multiplayer?
yes, requires some trickey after, sypwn knows how
Good to know, thanks

In what situation is this used, just wondering?
In case someone wants to act as an actual ATC (as a ground or tower controller)
Mainly developed due to a request from someone in a group I'm in, but decided to post it here in case anyone wants to use/modify them since no charts currently exist.

It doesn't seem relevant enough to pin here, but should be put somewhere that can be referenced. @Freedomplaza could this go in one of your manuals?
Or maybe on the wiki @AtrociousAmbition/Mr. Charisma ?
Maybe, if not I'll put it in the SOPs

How do i edit the max Player count in a scenario. It says i can only have 8 players but i want 12. is there any way to change it at all?

How do i edit the max Player count in a scenario. It says i can only have 8 players but i want 12. is there any way to change it at all?
Max players per team is limited by the number of player spawns on that team. Additionally, the max players total (both teams combined) is 16.
If you placed AH-94 spawns, they default to single seat. You have to change Slots to 2 for each one to allow a gunner.

that makes sense as to why i can only have 8 players per team.  can you change the total max of 16?
I will definitely steal the runway measurements tyvm 😊
I dunno what kind of awful diagrams you have seen with no runway length indicators

Are those the actual measurements?
Of course
I did ATC for far too long

Did you get the runway width too by any chance?
70 from memory

If you're trying to make it obvious that we won't get anywhere with text chat, you succeeded.

it could also have something to do with the nested sequences I had going on, too? 🤷‍♂️
Doubt it.
Yeah, probably triggered by copying a unit in a group, but the bug only occurs in specific unknown circumstances.

what is the best way to create a variable ticket system for lives? im trying to make a VTOL rushish gammode where each point taken adds more tickets to the attacking team. They only way i can think to do it is very brute force
I was hoping there would be some way to do it with global values, but then I need to run an "alive" or spawn check for each of the attackers to increment the counter. IK you can use score to keep track of deaths of the team, but the problem with this is that it makes the ticket integration a bit more clunky, especially if i want to add optional objectives that increase the ticket counter. Plus it makes it more difficult to tweak the values as I will have to dig into all of the conditionals for each stage.

Why not simply "Add Lives" to each slot on that team?

Why not simply "Add Lives" to each slot on that team?
I want to keep it a team wide pool, rather than just each slot.
Every time a player's life reaches 0, if there are any spare lives, it grants that player one additional life.

Question:  Can a mission run indefinitely if at the last objective, you just reset all other objectives?  It's a little more complicated than that, I'm just trying to figure out a way to run something that's similar to a headless server, just not quite headless.
Yes you can reset objectives to make a mission run forever. Just be sure that there is always at least one active objective at all times.

Immediately after attempting to launch the mission, upload your player log.  To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

I'd like to turn it into something like dynlib for some co-op fun
I can walk you through the trigger code, but the hard part is placing every possible unit, and giving them all alt-spawns.

So just making sure, if you host a round and ban someone, your not blocking them just stopping from a rejoin on that one match? Sounds viable with a no late rejoin set as well.
> stopping from a rejoin on that one match On that *one lobby*, so they are gone until you fully rehost the lobby
I kind of feel like they should be forced to killcam watch until everyone dies... lol

Do we know if the dynamic liberation creator is on here?
Yes?
Is there a way to have this 1 life option enabled for one of the modes or should we stick to the host and ban as they die route?

Also, love the work you put into that scenario.
The problem with adding new variations is that it's already a lot of work maintaining 9 versions. If I make the change to one, I have to propagate it to all of them.

I'm upload my first campaign to the steam workshop, but when I click upload it says "Invalid scenario". Does anyone have a fix?
Did you fill out the scenario name and description?
Yes I did.

Did you fill out the scenario name and description?
Yes I did.
Not in the campaign

Is there no option to set a target's detection mode via event sequence action?
nope
but if its stationary, you can despawn that object and spawn another in its place with a different detection setting

Are they ground units, and are they in a group?
yes and yes
Ground units in a group will ignore default behavior and individual orders. They must be ordered to move as a group using a UnitGroup trigger. Or you can remove them from the group.

just double-checking, does the "player" triggered by option work for all players or just the host?
You mean objectives and triggered events? Those look for any player.
thanks

I want to make a mission where if the player destroy the target spawned in the random location, another new enemy spawns in random location and endlesslyrepeats.   the core part of this mission is spawning the enemy in random location at start, and resetting the mission by spawning it again in another ramdom location after the enemy is destroyed.

but there's an issue with the mission completion. If I assign the objective like this picture abd destroy the enemy, the enemy immediately respawns in the exact same position instead of switching to one of the other alt spawn locations.  Is there a way to make the enemy respawn in other alt spawn positions upon mission reset ?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#rerollaltspawn>
thank you so much! it did not appear via googling

I have tried that method.  I have added text messages for each conditional action editor ifs, and it randomly displays numbers 1~10 so the RNG is working fine.  However, spawning the enemy in event sequence just ignores force alt spawn and keep spawning in the exact same spot.  I guess it's bugged or the FAQ is outdated ?  Using force alt spawn in trigger works.
Make sure the force alt spawn happens while the unit is dead. You may need to put the spawn action in a separate node after the force alt spawn action.
it did it like this, as FAQ site showed

can you show the contents of the conditional action?
it had the same result when I didn't added messages to see if RND is working.
as I said RND itself is working according to the message.

can you post your player.log after testing it?
Where can I see the log?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

this is the log from the latest test. I think you should mainly look around 'MAD-4 Radar [4] forcing altspawn'

is it really a bug then ?
yeah
got it, at least now I learned the reason. I think I should go for spawning initial random enemies and then replaying the mission, or constantly spawning in the same location.

I wonder how this mission made endless enemy waves.  Since vtol vr don't allow to edit other's missions unlike many other flight sims i'll probably never know.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913955345
Enemies can be respawned. Objectives can be restarted. What part are you confused about?
Spawning enemies randomly among alt spawn points

https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#rerollaltspawn

Only your specific implementation is bugged. I'm looking into why right now. Have you tried it with other types of units? It might be an issue unique to MAD-4 Radars
Then I'll try it again today.
With other units

Is there a document describing the ai behaviour ? Path and parked are self explanatory but I don't know how exactly stayinradius, follow, and railpath works
Nope, sorry
`stayinradius` doesn't seem to work properly when I tested it. The units all piled up in one place. I have no idea how to specify the leader for `follow` `railpath` is deprecated. It was an old workaround an old bug. Don't use it.

I have 2 more questions :  1. Is it possible to display a global value in the tutorial message or anywhere else ?  2. I want to make a smart FARP point to allow rearm and repair the helicopter. There's repair vehicle event but is reloading the weapons not possible ?
> 1. Is it possible to display a global value in the tutorial message or anywhere else ? Nope. Best you can do is create a conditional action that has a condition for every possible value of the GV, and displays a different popup for each one
> 2. I want to make a smart FARP point to allow rearm and repair the helicopter. There's repair vehicle event but is reloading the weapons not possible ? You mean in singleplayer? Have you tried the "reset vehicle" action?

Does reset vehicle also rearm all the weapons ?

I can't find a place to place them in the editor

New question : can pick up mission be done by any vehicles or AV-42C only ?
Only AV-42C can pick up infantry. (So far at least. Likely getting a blackhawk someday)
Got it, I wanted to make a pick up mission for dragonfly as well.

infantries not randomly roaming around is pretty fatal to me but OK. is Baha doing something about code optimization ?
AFAIK he's always optimizing code
this game is already impressively optimized for a flight sim, I can't appreciate him enough

Do you mean the "Dynamic Liberation Solo" challenge mission specifically? Or just hosting a private lobby?
just hosting private lobby
my goal is making singleplayer AH-94 dynamic mission / campaign

Is that intended or just bugged ?
Pretty sure it's a bug
And yeah I'd call that one catastrophic. Not sure why he hasn't fixed it.

Does anyone have info on sam launcher ranges?
I know people have spreadsheets for some stats
I have one for radar power, but their launch range apart from a max value is very dependent on the aircraft RCS

yo, for a mission I'm working on there are 4 helos and 2 jet slots for players. I want to make it so two allied ai aircraft will take off and assist helos in place of player jets if no players occupy the 2 MPspawn 'jet' slots. what conditions should I have my triggers check for to see if a player is in a player slot for a jet or not? I know the 'alive' condition will =true for ai units placed in missions but not spawned yet, does it behave differently for players? do they only trigger as alive once a player joins that slot? or is a player technically alive until dead even if not spawned into the world?
Player Alive checks are only true if a player is alive at that moment. They do behave differently from AI alive checks.  But you can't have AI form up on Players in MP.
that's fine, they don't need to form up. just float around the map hunting air targets to take some pressure off the helos when other players in jets aren't around

Oh is there an event to change the amount of fund ? I couldn't find it.
Pretty sure it's under Unit -> MP Spawn -> Add Funds
But it's singleplayer mission.

I’m trying to have unlimited spawns until a missions triggers then set lives to 3. Is this possible? Can’t figure it out
Can global values be transferred to the next mission in campaign ?
No

I've been having issues with the pop up text 'tutorial message' action not showing text for other players in my multiplayer missions lately. It seems to work with some messages but not others? Does anyone know anything about that, pop up text not displaying for players in mp?

Are they supposed to pop up right at the start of a mission?
No, i use that action to broadcast info throughout missions.

Well I've heard of it not firing for everyone in some situations, but I don't think I have a concrete example to investigate.

@Dutchy why did the tutorial message not show for everyone again?
we tested this, and for some it only shows for the host
So if you know of a specific mission where messages only show for certain people, I can look into it.

Having real trouble getting enemy ground units to move. I've tried infantry and the missile truck, I set them to 'path' and the 'defaultpath' is set to a path I made. I've tried making the starting node of the path the exact position of the unit, slightly ahead of the unit, slightly above the unit and same for the second point.   I made a friendly carrier move following a circle with no problems. Is there something different I have to do?
If ground units are in a group, they will ignore default behaviors and individual commands. They must be ordered to move as a group.
I'll try that, thanks

That was it, thanks! If I put them back in a group, how can I set path settings on the group?  Also, is there a way I can 'run' the mission from the editor without launching? It would be good if I could test that they move and see how long they take from the editor.
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#testwithoutvr>
Use a trigger action to order the whole group to move.

i have no experience with the mission editor but i kinda feel like trying to make a furball mission when i get home are there choosable levels of AI?
You can choose which aircraft they fly and what weapons they have equipped.
but AI behavior/difficulty is constant?

yes
damn

I'm looking to create a mission that encourages communication between two groups of aircraft. I'm currently thinking of doing this by having an F45 with an A2A loadout, and 1-2 AH94s. The F45 will be performing CAP and marking targets for the AH94(s). I want the AH94(s) to utilize firing from cover, using GPS points provided by the F45. I want being exposed for too long to be a threat for the AH94(s), without making things even more difficult for the F45, and I want the F45 to have a job to do that doesn't require the AH94(s) to engage in A2A combat. Any ideas?
My current ideas are having VTOL bombers take off, attempting to damage a friendly carrier group or something similar. I might add some enemy fighters, but only giving them FOX 2s to make missile evasion easier on the helis.
Make use of the "Gets Detected Now" triggers.  Enemy only has short range detection (SAAW, IRAPC, maybe GAVs?). F-45 have to run slick or stay distant. AH-94 have to stay behind cover, getting GPS targets from F-45s, or using their radar.

Haha yeah I'll do that

Is there a way to disable the SAAW missiles and have them only use their cannons? Night maps look amazing with all of the tracers flying into the air, but I'm trying to make it easier on the player by removing missiles
not that I'm aware
I learned to do things without trigger events

Is it normal that the in game GPS has green grass height map despite i made desert map ?
yeah
Any way for me to pass variables between missions within a campaign to check what side missions have been failed/completed in a previous mission and then apply their influence into the mission afterwards?

What are all the low tech missiles/bombs?
Im tryna make a low tech mission and make sure all the high tech stuff isnt included
AIM-7 and AIM-9e are the low tech missiles

my small mission somehow gets stuck on 100% loading, its the tiniest map so i doubt its a hardware issue. any1 know whats causing this?
This is the issue I mentioned a long time ago with the death sounds in rogue squadron. Why I had to make them all a sequence. https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/1069418114938323004
wait until it gets stuck, then post your player log

Oh, you hit the vehicle slots bug. Did you copy an AH-94 spawn point, then change it to a different vehicle?
https://tenor.com/view/awkward-black-kid-gif-4937950
yes

are you a programmer? ive checked out logs before but i cant make head or tail from 90% of what i read
Yeah. I'm not a developer for VTOL VR specifically, but indeed that skill does help understanding log outputs.

1. I start at the bottom of the log and scroll up looking for an Exception. Here we find an `IndexOutOfRangeException` right near the bottom. 2. The text right above the exception usually shows the last thing the game did before the exception occurred. In this case, it was setting up the player spawns and slots. 3. The part here says exactly where in the code the error occurred. In this instance, I'm already aware of a bug in the `GenerateSlotDesignation` function caused by copying an AH-94 slot with 2 seats, then changing it to a different vehicle.
That bug is already fixed in 1.6 btw

In the mission editor how would I detect if someone goes above a certain altitude?
With a condition?
nvm found it

Oh? What's the unit referred as?
disregard, I glanced over it because it's called a "Anti-Air Artillery". The "Artillery" made me think of the usual Howitzer/Mortar definition, i.e ground units vs grounds units
Yeah it's the only AA gun in the game

How far away can a SAAW target an aircraft?
Radar detection ranges vary wildly. They are unpredictable.
I can check the unity for that later.  Since I can inspect all the stats in unity I'd like to contribute on wiki page. The weapons and enemy infos are so lacking.

Is it possible to duplicate a mission you have created in order to make minor edits and make a different version. Example: Made a guns only PvP and I want to make the same thing but guns and heaters?
I dont want to go and place all the same mission assets though
im an idiot lol nvm, there is a save as... option haha

In my mission I want an objective to fail if a unit is detected by radar with manpads along the path. This is not possible is it?
In a future update it would be cool if instead of unit group  > alpha > detected > enemy you could have a list of units to choose from like other variables
I don't understand. Who is detecting who under what conditions?

I don't understand. Who is detecting who under what conditions?
So the objective fails when any mp unit is detected by enemy.  My intention is to only fail when MP unit detected by a radar. I want manpads to spawn along the path so you must kill them without being detected by radar. But obviously the objective fails when the MP unit is detected by the manpads.  So this logic is impossible currently correct?
Set it so when whatever radar sees you, it fails

Edit condition in sequence events?
I don't think this is an option
I meant like entry/exit conditions in sequences

Can you give more detail what you’re trying to do?
But off the top of my head Else/ Else If conditional is probably your best bet. System > system > fire conditional action
Can't select the radar unit and have it say "detects > [player]"?

Can't select the radar unit and have it say "detects > [player]"?
nah
SAM launcher is not the radar

You mean having different spawns?
Yeah,  so imagine an enemy plane takes off flys to a zone and then randomly searches in that zone so flys different patterns and altitudes then when it’s fuel is low it lands refuels takes off again, or a different way if as the player flys into a trigger then it spawns an enemy plane or heli that spawns somewhere in the zone and again searches at different heights and patterns
So is their a way to spawn an enemy at varying attitudes

How to update my uploaded mission ? I'm not sure steam -> upload will update it or just create newer one
It will update
Thanks

How the HELL does StayInRadius work in VTOL?
When I double click the new spawn it jumps to that spot but it’s only 1 unit their not a group , I have checked that I have sync group clicked which is but it still just moves one
You have to move one alt spawn at a time for each unit

@hijong park  Thankyou. With the stay in radius, what do you mean by cirulcar paths?  If I had an enemy heli and wanted it to spawn and randomly fly around how do I do that
Make a path with 4 points, and set path mode to smooth with loop checked. Then enemy will smoothly circle around 4 points
Is there a way to use the AH94 desert camo? I thought it would automatically apply with the biome

Is there a way to use the AH94 desert camo? I thought it would automatically apply with the biome
There's not a way to force it. The "desert camo" is just the REDFOR camo that's applied to everyone on Team B
I suppose if it's multiplayer you could make everyone on Team B

Assign? Are skins chosen by the mission maker?
taking from the steam workshop and what we have been told, yes
there will be proper skin support

Does sam launchers need to be in the same group with radar to operate or can radar automically help any sam launchers around it ?
When you go inside the SAM launcher, you select which RADARs feed it data
Thanks I should have inspect it further

Does anyone know that if you use the "fire conditional action" to destroy player vehicle, and then have another event that changes player spawn when they die, will the second event pick the vehicle getting destroyed by command as death or no?
@Sypwn
It should be considered 'is not alive'

So my "code" won't work?
As it is right now?
Can you upload your event screenshot, I can experiment that while making my mission

is there a way of adding custom wingman voicelines to missions? i know theres a mod that allows you to add new ones, but im wondering if you can add them to a mission afterwards
not without mods
I have almost finished tedious 'random encounter' feature in my mission.  I have done some tests and it had been really fun. This is THE mission I had been searching for since I started VTOL VR.  Now starting to add various random objectives.

Can I ask how many alt spawns do you put per enemies ?
4-6
Oh

@Sypwn how do u make the GAV 25 Bullshark take of vertically?
will the takeoff command in events be enough that it knows todo vertical takeoff or no?
It will always take off vertically, if possible. If the TWR is too low, it will either taxi to a runway (if on airbase), or do nothing (if not on airbase)

should I just manually set up a few waves and have them respawnable?
Depends on the specifics of how you want them to behave, but generally yeah just set them to respawn when destroyed. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#respawnunit>
In 1.6, we'll be getting a new action to re-roll alt spawns, so that part will be simpler.

My New questions  1. If i destroy av-42c via event, will its  corpse last forever on the map ? I know there's static object for that but static things can't have alt spawns.  2.there is a condition for the units getting detected by ally or enemy which will be useful for making dynamic BGM, that transforms between peaceful and combat BGM. does getting detected event only works once, or work again if the unit got hidden and then detected again later ?
> If i destroy av-42c via event, will its  corpse last forever on the map ? No  > does getting detected event only works once Yes. Once a unit gets detected, it's "Detected" forever
Except players have a special "Gets detected now" condition that only checks if they were detected *this frame.*

it possible to have radio message play only to a specific mpunit. say if mpunit0 within radius play message but only the mpunit0 pilot and gunner (AH94)?
no

any way i could cheese something to blow up its radar?
Spawn in an AI with optical AGMs set to only attack that radar
thats the only way?

Is the length of radius in near waypoint or land objective settings measured in meter or nm or anything  else ?
everything in the editor is in meters
or m/s

Setting lives to 0 here grants infinite lives, no?
no, it makes the slot unusable until lives are granted by a trigger
if you want unlimited lives, uncheck the "limited lives" box

One last thing regarding spawns. Allowed slots is how many people can use it as a spawnpoint?
I can't really launch into vr atm so there's no great way for me to test it
allowed slots is only for AH-94, and sets whether it can hold a gunner

yo does anyone know that if i tell an AV-42C to unload passenger's will it wait until it is on the ground?
dunno
alr i guess ill see then lol

should i upload it here?
first, search it yourself for that AV-42C
alr

i see it says something about not having an available parking spot and/or that parking spot not having a runway?
but it allowed landing in VTOL mode
My guess is still that the TWR is too low to vertical land

is that still too heavy?
no, that should be fine
ok, send the log

Anyone know why I can’t place spawn points on a carrier?
what kind of spawn points?
Friendly spawns

I want to force GAV-25 Bullshark always fly in hover mode so they would act like a psuedo-enemy attack helicopters.  At which velocity AI aircrafts stay in hover mode?
They don't
They only hover when taking off and landing, and that's done on rails

So I’m a fleet of aircraft, all in the same group, if one is on a path will all be or do I need to set them all to a path?
you need to order **the group** to follow the path using a Unit Group event action
How do I do that?

How do I do that?

I'm thinking the answer to this question is "no" but does anyone have a reliable method for having the player (or players, in coop) manually signal to the game to continue with events? ie: player needs to signal to av42s to drop their troops, up to player to determine when its clear or not, player needs to signal to the av42s manually to continue  Tried using a strobe light interaction event but that doesnt seem to work in MP
You have to be clever with the tools available. In the case of telling an AV-42 to drop off, you can check if a player is locking it with a TGP.

Use a program like Blender, Substance Painter, or Quixel Mixer to paint on the provided FBX files. Then export the texture, and import it into VTOL VR using the livery editor in the mission editor's main menu.
ok

in the player's 'Using weapon' property, is weapon safety mode or not arming any weapons considered to be blank or 'NO WEP' ?

You have to extract the game files with AssetRipper, then manually convert the base mission to vts format.
Damn ok thank you

Hello, I am sorry to bother and I bet this gets asked a lot. I just finished my mission, it isn't very big in fact it is very much a small quick mission. This is my first time trying to upload one of my missions to the steam workshop so I have no idea what I am doing. This leads me to my problem. When I try to upload it, all I get is an "ERROR LIMITE EXSEEDED". I have no idea what this means and I've tried to go online to see if someone else had the problem, but no one I could fine had the solution. Now I am here, what does this mean and how can I get passed it?
Is there any way to convert a workshop mission I made back into a mission editor file? I've formatted my hard drive and forgot I had all my mission editor stuff on there
Your campaign image is too big. It needs to be under 1MiB

Your campaign image is too big. It needs to be under 1MiB
and it should be a jpeg too

Are you sure all mission and campaign images are `.jpeg`s and are under 1MiB?
You need to convert the image, not just change the extension.
Yeah just checked

is there a way to edit the default missions? I want to change the T-55 BFM mission to have guns only rather than missiles and guns
Not easily. You'd have to use something like AssetRipper and extract the mission files.
why wont these enemies fire their radar missiles until im within 6 miles?

im trying to set up a simple 2v1 BVR mission but they wont engage me until im really close.
they have only fox 3s no fox 2s

Did you re-select the new image in the campaign editor?
I fixed it. For some reason if the name of the pic was longer than 6 characters it would not work
Try putting force detection. That worked for me.

How many units do you guys usually put in large scale missions ?
Is there a way to define or force a livery for an aircraft in a mission?
Force Detected only makes them show up on players' nav

For players, yes, unless the lobby host overrides it.

Would making many alt spawn hurt performance much ? I tested my mission myself but it had been running solid
No, more alt spawns shouldn't have an effect on performance. But they do have a significant effect on the size of the vts file
I want more replayability so I have put more click labors

folks..  question re quicksave/ quick load triggers.  Im building a training mission with voice instructions.  Ive set an action to quick save in certain places, and also a trigger action tied to a cockpit button at certain times to quick load last save point  (to alow repeat of the last training section in case someone gets stuck and needs to listen again instructions) But when I test it -  the quick load happens perfectly, but the voice files dont play again... what am I doing wrong?  any tips?    Cheers!
Haven’t touched the mission editor in a while, is it not possible anymore to disable certain weapons for certain vehicles in multiplayer or am I missing something?
Im having a random problem with my objectives.

Is it possible to convert an MP mission the SP without having to redo everything?
Yes, by editing the vts manually. But there is no tutorial, you'll have to figure it out. See the question from that FAQ about editing vts files.
Ok thanks

Thnaks. my training mission is a single player quickie already, are suggesting to test with completely new misssion? the other idea was what if I build a new replicated objective  / training section basically same as, that gets triggered instead of a quickload.. long way round, but..

When nobody have made a mission you want to play (single player randomized ah94 mission in my case) You are going to make a mission furiously.

yo, does the E-4 not communicate hostile aircraft info if it's set to 'engage enemies=true',  radar on, and it's set to orbit a waypoint? The E-4 in my mission won't broadcast any hostile ship info, even if you request bogie dope it just says 'negative'. which is weird because I don't ever remember having trouble getting the awac broadcast info to allied aircraft before in my previous missions. Is there some known bug regarding getting the awac to communicate or am I missing something I forgot to check?
I haven't messed with awacs much
Create an empty mission with just you, an awacs, and an enemy that spawns in after a few seconds. See if that works.

if i make a mission in the campaign mission editor i can still use it in mp right?
...what?
what is the "campaign mission editor"?

what is the "campaign mission editor"?
there is a mission editor, and a campaign editor
To make a multiplayer mission, you have to create a multiplayer campaign and put the mission in that.

really? i couldn't find the option when i was trying it in the standalone mission editor to set it as multiplayer, and when I googled it it said I had to create a mission in the campaign editor to do so instead
See the first question in the pinned FAQ, lol
ah i think then i misread

is there a reasonable do not exceed number of units for multiplayer?
mulitplayer one was set to av-42 and not f/a-26 so it wouldnt show the level id made
The performance impact is different depending on the types of units: Players > AI aircraft > Moving land/sea units > Stationary units  Dynamic Liberation usually has about 40-80 units active per sector, depending on intensity and dice roll.

Does having a bunch of Units on map but not spawned (not spawned until triggered) impact anything? I want to make a mission where someone can kill a unit at base and it will trigger a set amount of unit on the map. if they shoot a diff unit it spawns that set etc etc. would having all those units "on map" but not spawned in cause any stability issue? Also does the map size Have and impact? or can you go to max size and still be fine.
In my testing, unspawned units don't have any performance impact.

One is a high quality mission, the other is a base game mission

What's the "RailPath" mode for ground units?
To make your cursor a specific angle to place units, you can type a new cursor angle in the bottom right corner of the editor. To make things like path nodes, use the Measure tool from one of those drop down menus at the top.

I'm also trying to figure out a way in my scenario to make fighter escorts actually act as escorts only, and not fly completely across the map to engage targets. Any tips for doing so?
Maybe uncheck engage enemies
And set the path

If I force all AI aircraft to be undetected, will that make them essentially only target players?
The detected settings mean the unit will always be visiible in NAV, or not, or only when they are in your line of sight.

Is it possible to load up any of the official missions in the mission editor? It would be helpful to see how some of those were built/use them as a base for new missions.  Similarly, is it possible to load any of the official maps in the map editor apart from Akutan? I have been really enjoying the t55 border war map.
You have to use AssetRipper to extract the raw files, then manually convert them to vtm, vts, and vtc where appropriate. Others have done it, but there are no tutorials.

How can I trigger an event when a player voices a command over radio?
Sadly there's no way to take inputs from the player directly
The most common way is to have them do some obscure thing (like turning on their strobe lights or locking a specific unit with their TGP) in order to trigger an event

allied ground support has reaming stations with assets, or invisible. should be there as well for team B. i assume this is a SP mission?

how do i make it where some enemy air units will fly a path when the players on the other team pass a certain waypoint?
If passing that waypoint is an objective, you can put an action in the objective's complete actions section. If passing that waypoint is not an objective, you can create a triggered event.
yep i just figured out the triggered event, i was trying to do it with the timed event and didnt realize it was a timed event

Whenever I make a mission in a game, I tend to either make it either really easy and noob friendly, or seriously difficult where the average player has a tough time.  Is there any guides / tips on how to make sure a mission is balanced between fairness and difficulty? or can it only be known through making the mission playable?
There's a massive difficulty curve in being able to evade active radar missiles. If the mission has them, it's going to be hard for noobs (unless they throw themselves at the enemy endlessly). If you don't add them, then the mission is usually too easy for skilled players.  You just have to decide who your target audience is.
So is there a way to add a little intro text in the players view when starting a mission?

However, in practice, once the hill was entered and the team score began to increase, leaving the hill did not work properly. I can't really work out why unless trigger events cannot be reused.

I am creating a KOTH gamemode. Prompts pop up when things happen like a team controls the hill, it becomes contested, it is abandoned, etc. I would also like to play different music according to which team holds the hill at that time, however doing this requires that the song restarts everytime it is prompted making it very annoying lol, if it were to resume where it left of I think it would be a bit more palatable

The gamemode functions pretty well as is but this would offer more intel to each team as to who is holding the point if they missed the pop up promt or something

So you really just want it to remember where it left off after switching to a different track and back? That's a more reasonable request to me.
Yes, so instead of a STOP BGM command, i would use a PAUSE BGM command

it ahs to be individually? i can't make a group do it?
Group actions only exist for actions that are guaranteed to be available to that whole group. Not all ships are drone launchers, so the "launch drones" action is not available as a group action.
After realizing that 'Stayinradius' behaviour is not randomly roaming around but just moving to X 0 and Y 0 coordiates,  I have devided the map in 9 sectors, made 9 extremely twisted bezier paths, and applied these to those 'random encounter' enemies in each sectors to make random roaming.  Not only it makes pretty good 'roaming around' effect, their constant changes in moving direction makes shooting turrets from over 4 Km away completely waste of ammo which is great.

Hello, I have a question, im trying to make a custom scenario  map to play whit friends, and i cant make the multiplayer plane spawn, i can only have 1 player spawn, is there a mod or another method to fix this?
First question <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ>
oh, thank you

How would I go about Self - destructing drones that were launched from their respective ships after the carriers are destroyed? Like, carrier 1 is destroyed, so carrier 1 drones self destruct.  or is that not possible?
Nope. Launched drones cannot be controlled. Which is why I don't use them.
The one time I did have to use them

can I not, like, use a "kill all" command / event when the carriers die?
dont think so
They don't show up in the selection, because they don't exist in any form until they are launched

which also bring another question, how do I make it so when the carriers spawn in, they don't spawn in their drones?
Hold up, are we talking about drone carrier drones or NFP carrier aircraft?
drone carrier drones

Hold up, are we talking about drone carrier drones or NFP carrier aircraft?
drone carrier drones
that the AI use

So in the event's spawn menu, If i select all enemy's except for the drones, it still spawns them?
the drones don't show up in the System -> Units -> Spawn action list
unless Baha changed it and I missed that

with the multiplayer move spawn event. If its to start immediately, with the entry condition of a MP slot / player not being alive. When the mission starts, and a slot isn't taken up, will it immediately switch spawn points? Or does it only switch if that slot has been taken and has ejected / died at least once?
It will immediately move the spawn point. Even if the players have selected a spot and are spawning in at the start of the mission, it will still move them because of <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#eventatstart>
(You can use that to roll random player spawns for a mission)

So i need to set a timer? So when the timer is done, they will at least be in the air
You should normally attach it to an objective
All present players take off, or form up, or something like that.

Ok, so if I have the Spawn change activating at the beginning of an objective to destroy something, it will then change it? Like this?
I feel like I'm missing context here. Why are you starting another objective as part of the Start Event of an objective?
And what does the "Respawn" event do? Move the player spawns immediately?

And what does the "Respawn" event do? Move the player spawns immediately?
If you post screenshots of all relevant events and objectives, that will help a ton
For context, something weird which I've been doing is that whenever an objective starts, it's starting action is to begin itself. (this is prob a waste)  Also, yes, the "respawn" is the spawn change

Right now, the players will spawn with a locked loadout, but when the spawn changes, I want them to be able to change their loadout to their preferences.  is that possible?
you have to make separate slots, and unlock them later using lives
How fast do sea units move?

How fast do sea units move?
Depends on the ship. The wiki should list each one. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/DMS_Cruiser>
A sea group in formation will move at the speed of its slowest ship.

Is there a way to have it so when a player respawns in a multiplayer mission, they can spawn in a different location?   Like after Obj 1 is done, they spawn in the air closer so they dont have to fly 5 mins to get back to the fight

oh sweet, thx

Add max speed to drone carrier page plz? <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Drone_Carrier>

Tips on organizing things in the editor?
when using the Alt Spawn, if you wanted a building and 2 sams and radar to spawn in different locations how do link them so that whole groups spawns in the different spots,? with units you can link the squad but not with buildings and sams etc
Buildings (from the map editor) and static objects cannot change their location through logic.

Also is their a way to spawn enemy ah-94? will they add helis to the enemy and then allow players to jump into the enemy side to attack
But if you're talking about stationary units
have one of them spawn normally with an alt spawn. Put a waypoint at each possible spawn for it, then use a Conditional Action to check where it spawned, and Force Alt Spawn on the other units to match.

could you take a screen shot of the complete process? sorry new to creating missions thanks

Start with a sequence where you spawn only the first unit (Unit-1)  Then in the second sequence node, put a condition action. The FAQ explains Conditional Actions in the context of doing something random: <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#chanceaction> Instead of using Chance conditions, you use Unit-1 Near Waypoint Possible-Location-A/B/C conditions for each if. For the Do Thing action, you have it Force Alt Spawn for all the other units in the group to match Unit-1. Then you   Then in the third sequence node, you spawn all the other units.

im thinking about making an AC7 campaign, but i'm not sure if I'm allowed. does anyone know if that would be against the rules?
Why would that be against the rules?
maybe copyright, but youre not making a game or publishing something on steam for money

you are free to make anything

Is it possible to have it so, if a carrier's random spawn is in a group, it's Sea Group will become that fleets group? So like, if it spawns in the top group, it becomes sea group alpha, but if it spawns in the bottom, it's sea group becomes Bravo?
Are these 2 random spawn areas?
i'm about to set up an alternate spawn point for each

i'm about to set up an alternate spawn point for each
You could have an if-else sequence like so:  RANDOM(50%) - spawn group A Else, RANDOM (100%) - spawn group B

Is there a way to set a group speed for sea units? so they all move at like 15m/s or something?
wait, if a sea group moves as fast as it's slowest ship, then what if every enemy ship in each corner of the map is in the same group?
also, how di I fail a mission if an objective is failed? Does it happen when a required objective is failed?

If the ships are ordered to move with a unitgroup action, they will attempt to form up, then move at the speed of the slowest ship.  If the ships are ordered to move individually, they will move at their own speed.

Is it possible to check if the player has fired countermeasures for a conditional objective?
Not that I can see.
Me neither! Alright, I'll bodge it 🙂 Thanks

is there a way to select multiple units at once and move them or do i have to move them all one at a time?
I'm trying to make a recon mission where the player locks the target spawned in random area and let the artillery units to fire and destroy it.  But since artillery can only be assigned to use in the assigned waypoint instead of specific unit I can't find any simple way to achieve this.
Again, i am a moron.

question when i make a scenario on a custom map made for it and i update something on the map is there a way to add the updated map to the scenario because now i need to redo the hole scenario?
Can you delete the scenario from the campaign, then readd it?
@Mr.NoLife  There is a rebuild option to update the map in the scenario

yes
Oh. Yeah. I completely misread the question

question i have a patrol path setup for some enemy boats but it look like the are not moving and just staying and the same place as were the spawn any idea what the issue is ?
i dont believe it was ever necessary to accept it to access the editor?
or at least i remember someone saying that

yea i never had to and i started on it yesterday

i can't navigate with the mouse, right?
someone sended me a link to make a senario mp compatible but cant find the link anymore  anyone that has the link by any change google is bieng a B***h
yeah that doesnt sound sus

I am confused as to what Wiki says that...?

pretty sure the FANDOM isn't that inaccurate

@ierdna100 i see youre editing the docs a tip :  add the file directory to this so its easyer to find for people new to all of this  Q:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\VTOLVR_ModLoader\mods\Multiplayer  because it can be a pain to find if you dont know were to look  How do I make custom frequencies? Change the files named “freq.txt” and “freqlabels.txt”.
not everyone has a godamn q drive
yea well Q: C: A: i guess people know were the installed the game

All the ships are in the Lima group?
yes exept the jets on the dek
And you’ve given them a bit of time to get themselves sorted out? Takes a while to get up to speed

And you’ve given them a bit of time to get themselves sorted out? Takes a while to get up to speed
The wake can take 30s or so to appear
yea even tryed a delay of 10 befor start this gave me some time for start up the jet take off and fly to them

They’re not affected by any other events?
nope
I got nothing. Sorry. I can take a look if you want to send me the scenario, but it looks like you’ve ticked all the boxes

Does the plane start on the carrier?
If yes it need a take off order
Sorry didn't rode the question properly

Question what is the differences between the mission editor and the campain i know on is just for a single mission but the campaint is that for multiple missions in one ?
A campaign is a bundle of missions essentially
question, what was the process for creating multiple out comes for missions?

quick question - If you want to open mission editor do you have to have your headset connected to navigate in-game to it or can you launch it independent? Because everything you do is on flat screen, right? Can't check by myself rn because I'm at work but I will be grateful if someone would answer to my question
you can launch it without your HMD

Afternoon all. Loving the game. Recently found steamworkshop and downloading various maps/missions/etc. Is it fairly simple to create missions? There was one in particular I loved - heading in, blowing up gnd targets, then picking up teammates from the roof of a building. Then go and search for a downed craft and pickup the crew, before returning home.
Would be great to be able to make an expansion on this. Like 5 friendly jets all heading in to evac ground troops while under fire. The SAR was very good too, apart from you didn't find crew on your own - there were waypoint markers
Daunting at first, but definitely not that difficult.

Oh, an ingame workshop mission? I was off searching steam for "killbox"
yes
imagine not using ends after your ifs

wait Scratch has an IDE?
yes, its called scratch
like competent IDE that draws CPU ressources and RAM?

Can you start a map with an NPC ally aircraft orbiting above a waypoint (holding) while you setup, take off, and rendezvous? I seem to only be able to place the other aircraft on the ground
Hold shift + mouse wheel to change the height of the cursor
Ah ha. I saw this vertical moving before, but I needed to press enter/apply before it accepted the new position

There's also vehicle control - side doors is equal to 0. Is there a better boolean to check if the doors are open?
(side doors) (is equal to) (1.0) ?
that's the control...?

(side doors) (is equal to) (1.0) ?

what else do you wish to acquire from the doors?

There's no boolean for doors open/closed. Just door value is equal to certain value. So which value am I looking for to test when the doors are open?
should be that one

Like "call an airstrike at this location" type thing?
spawning the tanker and AWACS only in the last iteration
I made the entire thing time based at some point

Another quick Q. I can set infantry to "Board Aircraft" but only select an AI aircraft. Where's the option to board the player aircraft?
Use the Pickup objective
Ok, so I have objective "Extraction", Type: Pickup, Startmode: Triggered, Waypoint:LZ I also have an event "landed at troops", which is as above: (landed in radius of "LZ", parking brake set, doors open)

What objective type? They complete themselves under different criteria
Ah ha. I had "fly to" as the objective type but I can select "Conditional" and set them all in there. Ok, that works
Thanks for your help. That's worked really nicely

Do you think it's a bit too similar to the other chap's one to upload to the workshop? Or is there another way for you to test it
If you send the .vtm file, we should be able to load it and try it, but it'd be very easy for someone to plagiarise. So I'd only do it to people you trust
is that a actual worry in vtol?

is that a actual worry in vtol?
plagiarised maps?
has that happened before?

Ok. Would you need the VTS only then, or the whole folder structure?
I assume you have the map
Easiest way to share it is to stick it up on the workshop

how hard is it to make mission sin this game? I have some pretty cool ideas
I recently joined, and a made a 2-part mission in just a day. The UI is really intuitive.
Things all follow a logical flow, and you can make something playable very quickly

where do I access the mission maker? in game or in a special menue?
in game
theres a button on ur monitor, but i think you can also open it in vr

Hi all, I have a question if anyone has may have struggled with my same issue. I am having problem with sound loudness. So I record little clips in audicity and they sound fine through VLC or Windows Media (like they are loud enough) but when I got to play them in the game the noise is so quiet I can barely hear my words. Has anyone else seen this before? I have tried recording them thinking I did something wrong. Exported as OGG.
I am not hearing my intro clip and I am not sure if it is because with all the other game sounds I simply cannot hear when I started my mission or my trigger isn't firing. Having a hard time deducing which one it is at the moment. Thanks for any advice you might have.
It might be a steam vr issue

wait are you saying your playing audio clips through the game?
im confused
just my index during testing of my campaign

So you guys made a mod for this game then?
its not out yet
but there are a few other mods yeah

you guys do other games? normal stuff or VR stuff?
we only work together on vtol
maybe move to modding

I do have a question about unit management if someone might have an answer. I have Echo group of four planes supposed to be following my group (Sierra) to the objective but when the mission starts they just fly off path and go in circles. What did I do wrong?
Thought it would be as easy as make a path, tell plane group to follow that path to a large group of enemies and then engage enemies will kick in...was my thought...and hope.
You might need to use an event that starts at mission start to get them to follow the path. The initial stuff in the unit options is a little janky

When I try to upload my mission to Steam, it goes to 10% and then say Generic Failure. Any ideas what might be causing this?
too big of a mission maybe?
try uploading a small one

too big of a mission maybe?
try uploading a small one
then updating it to a big one

What other assets does it use? Sound files? Images in the briefing?
I have one image for the briefing and one as the mission thumbnail. Neither are very high-res or anything.
How big are they, file-size-wise?

How big are they, file-size-wise?
If you post the game log, there might be something in it that gives a hint why it’s failing
a few hundred kliobytes only

is that the player.log shortcut in the VTOL VR folder?
That should be fine. You get several megabytes
Is the file the shortcut points to

Did you have mods loaded when you created it?
I believe I might have had the Nuke mod loaded for testing, not 100% sure tho
Actually no, now that I think back to it, I'm pretty sure I had it loaded

Yeah, agreed, tht does seem like a likely cause. Any ideas how I might fix this?
@Ketkev wrt yesterday’s stifled rant, ^
Not a clue. I’ve no idea what oddness the mod has put in the mission file

Hi all, may I ask those here willing to help...to help? I want to make an awesome campaign to play, something big like 8 to 12 missions. Anyway, I am not a game developer and have never tried anything like this before. I just added a new campaign "The Shlabovian Conflict" with the intro mission so I can learn. Would anyone be willing to play it and give me feedback?
I want to know how big (and by big I mean grandiose in terms action and objects) and want to know how big is too big? Also what is too easy and conversely what is too hard? So before I go to the masses or design multiple missions I thought I might try to get a handle on these things...even if just a little.
Thanks for any support you are willing to give in helping me make an awesome campaign for the community to play.

So I am not sure what happened in your game but when I downloaded it from steam and tried it, it worked as it did in testing. Mission launch, greeted by some audio, fly towards air base (see dog fighting going on), echo and kilo kill enemies over air base, 8 incoming bogies arrive and more dog fighting ensues, Overload warns about 16 more incoming fighters (at this point combat usually shifts towards the city in the direction the enemy came from as well as the river and ravine running through the middle of the island) which cues up some epic music...more dog fighting, upon victory...message from actual and RTB (required to land at base (though I think I need to specifically set a way point or something that shows the player to return to the base on the map)). So seems to work as expected for me. Maybe your download got messed up somehow?
probably a problem on my side then

Hey dude, tried your campaign just now. Just the one mission for now, right? Nice map, straight in the action, and nice to see wingmen ready to go too. I found the briefing audio was a little quiet and hard to hear - same with some of the custom radio messages you recorded. Also I found that I loaded probably the wrong setup (I'm a noob) so I had a few AAM all used up quickly but also a few AGM which I then didn't use. Ended up reverting to cannon sparingly. Still, completed and good fun.
Was cool to land at the base to see it pretty destroyed - looks like it took a beating

Makes me want to add radio and music to my mission. Or, better yet, convert to a campaign

I think it's a good idea - however what is your aim of these videos? Who's your target audience? Other people who are new to VTEdit and need help learning about it, or do you want to tell a story of your own development?
I really like your mission though. It's made me want to expand on mine and make a campaign, adding some story, music, and perhaps some voice acting by @Quantify  😉
Hah, I'll take you up on that offer

"Right listen in chaps. We have multiple baddies coming from the north, and a few naughty bandits from the south. We need to... Pay attention Johnson.

Heyy mates, I'm creating missions atm, but how do you set player spawns, I can set one, but my friends spawn in the same place, how do you set spawns for player 2,3 etc?
PD: I'm not sure if this is the correct place, sorry if it isn't
you cant i think

Ahhhh I don't know how to do that (the play list thing...not really a youtuber...could you help?) and greeat point. I will add video numbers to the title.
Hey I really appreciate all the feedback. I am really trying to do the community a solid here. I am cranking out more of these bad boys as we speak. Just finished timed events.
I don't make youtube videos but have seen many authors have a variety of different playlists on their channel, for different themes/subjects etc. Then each playlist is ordered

hey, I'll hit y'all up for the shlabovian conflict if you are interested, more the merrier right?
oh yes!
what's the issue?

Also, thought/question about an idea. A community campaign? Something checked into git hub that multiple people contribute to? Or we have one person make each mission? Then we call it VTOL VR : Ace Combat...A Shared Experience (or like A Community Experience)
its dumb. its dumb right?
I'm quite new to this but I think the technology doesn't allow that. Missions are attached to your steam account and uploaded to the workshop from that, so I'm not sure you could "commit" code into github, then somehow "update" in the workshop

Is there a way to launch the game into the mission editor?
Just start the game from the Steam library and use the mouse to click the mission editor button in your desktop window.
Ahh thankyou

The third part of the mission (no spoilers) my wingmen seemed to stay behind. That intended?
they are told to flee as well so not sure what is happening there
They stayed engaged from what I could make out on the radar screen

Can you manually trigger all wingmen to disengage and form up on player?
yes
That way, if I don't flee fast enough, my wingmen are stuck with me and die

How are people adding flares/smoke/markers to the missions? I've seen loads before but in the mission editor I can't seem to find any
I'm trying to visually mark waypoints
add an event

Is it the best way? I just want fixed colour flares on the map
best/simplest
there is no other way to spawn flares

why would you want in feet?
everything in the editor is in metric BTW
because, europe, and stuff.

I think only Russia uses Metres?
I meant non-aviation related
Even flying in the US i seem to recall we all used FT

isn't russia switching to feet qnh too?
they are

Is there a way to edit the mission that come with the game? I want to do a Coop version of stealth strike.
you can steal them from the game files and dump them into your editor files
where can I find them I the game files?

where can I find them I the game files?
not sure to be honest
looked through the files, cant find them :/

When in development of a mission, you're often back and forth between mission editor on the pc, and headset ingame. If enabled, you will start at the loadout screen. Is there any other way to start at the Brief screen instead? We can only really see the briefing screen once uploaded to Steam
If you save the mission and go into VTOL normally, it will be in Editor Missions iirc
sorry Custom Missions

Are you DCS'ing or VTOL'ing tonight?
Not tonight I'm afraid, pretty late and I'm not feeling great.
No probs - no rush on the settings file at all. I won't be on it for a couple of days

Are you thinking about buying any modules?
Because otherwise the A-4E Skyhawk is a good dogfighter (free module)
Oh, not sure. DCS hasn't been running too smoothly for me, so I've been in VTOL and mission editing

Could I please ask for some advice/assistance. Had to uninstall and re-install VTOL VR due to an audio glitch and I have lost access to edit the two missions I recently created and uploaded to Steam Workshop (Fighter Pilot ZX Spectrum Mission and Black Buck One - Falklands) Is there some way of being able to retrieve my mission editor files? 🙏
No

Oh i see.   What i did for kill box is make every actual objective not required. However, upon completion of each objective, it adds 1 to "win" global value. The master required objective (provide cas in this case) completed once "win" global value = 5.    I would make do something similar here. It wont matter which objectives are completed or in what order.    If you dont want to make multiple objectives and dont need waypoints, you can bake the selection into condtional success argument using ANDs and ORs + global value linked to which spawn like so:  In the action that spawns group A, also set a global value "spawn" to 1. If spawn group B, set gv to 2. C, 3 etc.  In excel formula format, the success conditional logic would look like this OR(AND(A=dead,gv=1),AND(B=dead,gv=2),AND(C=dead,gv=3))  Also, always be sure to trigger the objective AFTER the spawn and gv actions are fired. (Sometimes i use a 1s timed event as a standoff)

Great thank you so much for the advice. 👍 I was not familiar with the whole global values concept but will try some experimentation with them. I did think that having so many objectives was the problem so will try a new approach. One other quick question.... I have downloaded a map from the workshop and am using for a campaign in compiling. I have renamed all the bases in my editor but in the game the comms base names revert to the original map names. Do you know if this can be fixed or am I stuck with the original names?
Just wondered if you would consider making a basic tutorial on using global values in the VTOL editor some time. I am not from a programming background so don't really get the concept of how they can be used. From what I understand though they could be another very useful tool in mission creation? Just some basic concepts would be great.
Yeah, absolutely. I can make one today...later on of course after work. I'd be glad to help.

Quick question, did you rename the bases before or after you referenced the map in your campaign? If you referenced it first, then changed the names, you have to update the map your campaign uses. This can be corrected by updating the map under C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\[name of campaign]\[name of mission]\[name of map directory] and in that directory you will see your map and some different height maps associated to it.Then you'll see the [mapname].vtm, this is the file with the base names in it. You could also probably just change them in that file in a text editor but be mindful of editing game files outside the game editor (you can more than likely break it).
For my Shlabovian Conflict map, this is my folder with the same data
and my path to MY file is this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\The Shlabovian Conflict\Outer Shlabovia - Summer Isle

I also just released two scenarios the first, Mt Everest FF, is just a free flight map of the mountain and it's surrounding area. Some of the highest peaks are marked as objective waypoints, so I gues it's also kinda educational. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385398 The second on is called Nuke the City, and as you might guess, you nuke a city. This naturally requires the Nuke mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385398
If anyone wants to test them out, please do!
Feedback is welcome.

did you make them public?
I did. The links don't seem to be working, but you can just search "Mount Everest Free Flight" and "Nuke the City" on the workshop I guess
You missed the "4" at the end of the link

I hope you like it. here it is, this time with a working link https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385398925

Does anyone have any ideas why my BGM music won't work in the mission editor. When I click the speaker to test the audio there is no sound and no music starts in the game when it is supposed to. I have custom radio messages working fine. I have tried MP3 and OGG files, short music clips, long music clips, nothing works. I uploaded some of the tracks into the main game audio files and can play them using the in built player so cannot understand why the mission editor won't play them?

Hmm, odd. Mine worked just fine. Simple MP3 file plays when you test it with the speaker icon. Is the file in the EditorResources folder?
@Judge_dredd Have you tried using a different file that you know plays, as the BGM? Like any other file (like your radio messages), just set as BGM as a test. If it works, it suggests there's an issue with the music MP3 file you're trying to use

Seems a bit odd that they would play in the music player but not in the editor. I can't imagine it having to different mechanisms for managing audio files. So it seems really weird for it to work in one but not the other. But I have never run into the issue before. I had an issue when trying to reference OGG files but that went away as soon as I started using MP3's.

The bug I found was when referencing an audio file...some times it break the save feature of the mission editor. Like I reference my MP3 audio file and when I go to save the mission nothing happens...it just sits there. I can't hit crtl + s either. Not sure why referencing an audio breaks saving but for me...this happens semi frequently. So I have adapted to setup my event the way I want it, save my mission, then try to reference the audio file. If it breaks, fully exit the game back to desktop and load back in.

is there a way to use downloaded  maps for custom missions?
Of course, once a map has been downloaded it should show up as an available map when starting the scenario or campaign
There could be a bug in the game regarding filename. Try shorting the filename and remove any spaces, symbols, etc. Just in case @Judge_dredd

Question: I'm running the public test branch. Do my uploaded missions only work on the same branch, or are they available to all?
!   QuantifyToday at 15:53 iirc it will display "INCOMPATIBLE GAME VERSION" if you are not on the same branch, yes it's backwards compatible - public testing branch users can play stable, but stable cannot play public testing

anyone know how to make a carrier follow its path with formation with other ships?
stick them in the same group
and make the group follow the path

and will they keep the same formation?
more or less
I recommend trying it

whats a good altitude/speed for a tanker and awacs?
very high very fast
20k ft @ 300m/s

so i have to look at this right?
Thanks for the advice, will take another look tonight
i've got a pattern up at 8000 feet

When making a mission, do you have any rules regarding copyright and using of other brand names - like Coca Cola Valley Run / Microsoft Defender / BMW Factory Berlin Tour (just random examples) ?
Those would fall under fair use, because you're not profiting
Perfect, cheers 👍

About just stealing Coke's IP for your own stuff?

Is that a banning?

Jammo was asking if it would land the developer in hot water, but the content is hosted by Steam isn't it?
Yeah
I'd be careful with it but it's a bit of a legal grey area in terms of what exactly you can use everything for. Since it's your own content I don't know why it'd be shifted to the dev since Steam is responsible for the content they host

Yeah, I'm sure
I am 100% sure that "I really want to" is insufficient reason to get a fair use exemption

So fair use doesn't apply to the above use anyway?
well, let me rephrase
the logos are covered by trademark and copyright law trademark doesn't have a fair use exemption because trademark protection is inherently limited to business uses -- it's for designating products copyright is more broad, but nonetheless has a fair use exemption carved out

How can I place bunkers? They are destructible, so I assume they're in the mission editor, but I can't find them under units or static objects.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385398925&searchtext=everest  Enjoy
They're a unit

With global vars in the mission editor, you can edit the numbers/variable counters, but are there any ways to make Timers?
There's the main mission timer, where you see the finish time, but it would be good to be able to have a custom timer that I can start/stop and edit too, like adding time to it
Not without wanting to die

Bear in mind, it'd be a series of several hundred steps, each waiting for 1 second, each incrementing a counter or something by 1, then... doing something with the counter afterwards? Horrible
ergh
maybe not then!

Plus a second question (2-for-1 special today): If a unit has multiple events/triggers/actions etc, is there a way to spawn an instance of this object (Object Oriented) so each class will inherit the same types/events/etc ?
No
Far less bodging room there

Anyone know of existing missions where enemy aircraft start out at a long distance?
Hey everyone! I'm making a fully voice-acted campaign for VTOL VR! Come check it out here:  https://discord.gg/tY4FH92rpJ
Damn I hate the sheer logic of the mission editor sometimes 😡

You hate boolean logic or how the VTEditor works?
Boolean logic!  it’s just too damn precise. You spend 2 hours putting together a complex mission, you’ve checked it thru several times. Then you launch and at first way point ‘mission complete’  .... i didn’t even get to shoot anything down  🥲 I know I only have myself to blame 🙄
Beautiful

What would you do with it? Apart from the one niche race/time trial case, I can't think of anything that couldn't be done with timer events
I have uploaded mission 2 of the Artemis campaign. Only 4 more missions to code 😰 ... currently 288 (random) mission objective combinations for missions 1 and 2.
still need somebody who natively speaks english to help me voice a campaign, its about 8 missions long and i could really use your help

Is there a way to make units engage only the ones you want? If I set them to do not engage then I set a designated target will they engage that?
You can set non-targets, and priority targets. If they’re not a non-target, they’re fair game, but they’ll go for priority targets first if they can see them. They’ll never attack non-targets
I see.

Is there a way to make an AI A/V-42C Hover at a certain point?
No
that sucks

are you flying the ASF towards the point towards where you expect the F45 to be?
using like, an orbit at waypoint command i think its called
Thing is, there’s no real way to know where the friendly wing is going to be, and waypoints can’t move to follow planes (afaik)

Wait, dumb question, but I expected RCS modeling to a swerling case 1 monostatic value. Is it actually modeled by angle and frequency?

Interesting! Thank you!

Hello! I was looking to setup a mission (on the F-26) that starts on a carrier, and I'd like to place the plane ready for takeoff, much like in the very first Over-G Fighters mission (gameplay starts at timestamp of video). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjlW1ptHPRk&t=60s Is it possible (yet)? The mission editor apparently only lets me place the player in parking spaces, and I'd like the mission to start with the plane flight-ready (which is simple) and ready to takeoff (having to just lower the launch bar could also work). By all means, tell me if I'm being a dummy and missing obvious buttons.
No
it is impossible to spawn the player on the deck or flying at 0 kn

Mh, thanks, I'll set it up so it's the closest parking to the cat - what is the default catapult, by the way?
default?
I don't see what you mean by default catapult

now that i think about it, are there any other missions with the independence day units on the workshop?
im pretty sure you can just modify the mission file to have the name of the J4 fighter instead of some asf aircraft to spawn it
If I have a group set to spawn due to a trigger but every unit in said group is **NOT** set to spawn immediately (as in they will not be active/spawned in the world on scenario start), will they still spawn just fine or must I have atleast **ONE** unit in the group active when the trigger is called for the rest to spawn?

If I understand you correctly, they'll spawn just fine
exkuse me guys how do make spawn mision edit

The mission is Complete when the last active objective is completed. What objectives do you have at the moment?
Hello, guys! I am currently planning my first mission, and I am wondering if there was a conditional to force the player's radar off
i mean, you could probably fail them if they turn it on i guess

Does anybody have any solutions or ideas?
It is not possible to force the radar off
If i place an aircraft carrier

how do i make it the player spawnpoint?
Place the player spawn on it :p
units - player iirc

i believe if you click on the carrier and go to its settings you can set it there?
i may be wrong, it has been a while
oh yes ur right

does navigate to waypoint with the aircraft carrier make it park at the waypoint have automatic collision avoidance?
i cannot remember, i am sorry
it should park at the wpt

do you know what these options mean?
force detected - visible to units no matter what
force undetected is ditto

Is there a way to see the radius??
like so that i can see the sphere
Force Detected has no effect on allies. Force Undetected has no effect on enemies

Force Undetected is for if you want a friendly unit to not appear on the Nav map till you detect them, like the lost pilot on The Island: Redirection(?)
Ships have no path finding or collisions. They will happily sail underground
How can i force an aircraft carrier landing on an aircraft carrier that has landed?

How can i force an aircraft carrier landing on an aircraft carrier that has landed?
like an objective
bc in my scenario the aircraft carrier moves

Not sure what you mean. Whilst playing the mission? No. In the editor, the radius often appears when adjusting it in the objective
I'm not going to say it always appears, but you'll see a coloured circle around the chosen waypoint whilst moving the slider
I've found the same, where adjusting the radius doesn't show the radius. Would be useful to see this

Also since my scenario is multiplayer, will an aircraft carrier spawn work? because i heard someone say me and my friend will spawn in each other
*shrug* Sounds like a #modding thing
I mean its kinda both

So when making a mission, is there any way to add custom voice lines to play at triggers or something?
Yup. Look in the System actions
Awesome

does that mean all the other objectives have to be completed?
Could someone explain how the start mode final works?
I think it triggers if all the other objectives are resolved, but I’m not sure if they need to be completed successfully or not

Could someone explain how the start mode final works?
I think it triggers if all the other objectives are resolved, but I’m not sure if they need to be completed successfully or not
because... it just didnt trigger and made my second to last objective have the popup with finish mission n stuff

How are you activating the second to last objective?
If at any point there’s not an active objective, the mission will complete
Even if of only for a single tick

Hey guys, i've noticed that if you restart a mission from the death screen, it doesn't appear to fully reset everything. Incoming fighters in my mission were where they were at when I died, and some events wouldn't trigger. Any Idea why?
I think it is because you crashed (plane) and you restarts your plane meaning you restart your mission
hey real quick when I try to upload a mission to the work shop it says I haven't accepted the workshop agreement... Even though I have. Anyone else had this?

hey real quick when I try to upload a mission to the work shop it says I haven't accepted the workshop agreement... Even though I have. Anyone else had this?
oh my vtol crashed lol
try going on Steam Workshop and accepting the Steam EULA

Have you been able to upload stuff recently?
bro now it says it's timing out
what is happening

is there a way I can manually upload a mission?
this just ain't workin
@BahKooJ go to %appdata% -> boundless dynamics -> savedata -> gameSettings.cfg

anyone know the height of the carrier and the difference between true bearing and BRC?
for the second one in my measurements its 9 degrees
is there anyway to manually upload missions to the workshop?

Hi People, looking at events in mission editor. I get triggered events and get timed events, I look at Sequence Events and can't fathom what you get different to timed events. There's Entry Condition and Exit Condition but not sure what these do/how they work. Anybody explain difference between Timed and Sequence Events and how Entry/Exit behave in sequences?
sequence events are a list of actions that will be triggered in order

the entry condition is all of the conditions required to be fullfilled for the specific event to start, and the exit is the same, but for the event to end and go to the next start condition

I'm having a problem with the "Take Off" command for an NPC AV-42C.  I have a long event sequence with several roof top landings and take-offs to simulate a troop assault on a building.  The first two times I use the "Take Off" command the AV-42C does a vertical take off.  But for some reason the last I use the "Take Off" command the AV-42C attempts a conventional take off from the roof, which doesn't work out well.  Is there a way to force the NPC to take off vertically?
it should automatically take off vertically if not at an airbase
thats probably a bug

Always a full load of passengers?
I reduced it to 3 passengers.  Was 5.  But fewer passengers didn't change the outcome.
It seems to be rotating the nacels way to soon.  Sometimes it starts with them vertical but I have watched them rotate to horizontal while its at full AB but before the wheels have left the ground.

is there anything that could potentially be "above" the aircraft?
Sequence is 9 nodes long.  Maybe 15 actions.  This is the last one.
by which i mean, structures

How do I do that in the editor?
It’s automatic when you gets a new objective
Huh

How do I get rid of the waypoint when the destroy interceptor objective activates?
In the new objective auto select a new waypoint. If  the previous waypoint was a gps point I think the player has to clear it manually
@Brady  In your Objective Editor: - Objective Type: Destroy - Start Mode: PreReqs (I use this to ensure all previous objectives are done first -> "This Objective has *prereq*uisites") - Waypoint (You can set a location, or allied/enemy unit) - Auto-Set Qaypoint: TICK this so your nav screen and HUD will guide you to the right area - Required: TICK

What if you don’t want the target waypointed? Or anything waypointed?
You could set nothing there? As long as you set the target in the right-hand menu (destroy these targets to complete objective)
And that gets rid of the current active waypoint for the player?

Ah I see the issue (I'm a bit slow today). So progressing onto the new objective, if no waypoint is set, it will keep the previous one?  - So this could be a feature request / bug, that when no waypoint is set, navigation and hud markers clear to *no* waypoint - Or you set a new waypoint which is indiciating the general area/vicinity for the objective. ("Fly to the north and finish off the enemy last seen around that area")

You can set "Waypoint: NONE" and perhaps if you "Autoset waypoint" too, this will clear the marker for the pilot

Perfect, that's good to know. So you set NONE and "auto-set waypoint " ?
yep

Anyone know how to get AI Aircraft to fly to a waypoint (preferably in formation with the flight lead or certain aircraft) below the hard deck of 1500?
Do planes have railpath? Because that sounds like a job for railpath
they dont have railpath, but they have path

Do planes have railpath? Because that sounds like a job for railpath
they dont have railpath, but they have path
i got the ai to fly through a tunnel before so uhh

Exactly. That list is empty for me. Is this a bug or is there a setting somewhere?
Do you have ASF 30s or ASF 33s already created?
I don't think  so.

Do you have ASF 30s or ASF 33s already created?
I don't think  so.
Should I have?

Also can a campaign include missions on multiple aircrafts? I want to include some objectives using anti-ship missiles using the F/A26B and some stealth missions using the F45A.
Campaigns are built for a specific aircraft, so no sadly.
Using the UI, no. I believe some people had some luck hacking the campaign files in a text editor, but I can't recommend it

hello, is there a tutorial somewhere for the conditional trigger system?
maybe even something about making stuff happen randomized
there is RNG, only for spawnpoints though

I guess it is not possible to restart a completed objective?
I kinda figured out how to "randomize" things, but I would have to do it in every completed objective again...
Nope. Pretty much everything is one-shot

but I need to do the "if then else" for 10 Objectives for every objective? there must be an easier way.... right?
nope
isnt there a way to "call" an event that does the "if then else" stuff? (the conditional action)

isnt there a way to "call" an event that does the "if then else" stuff? (the conditional action)
Sure. Once
It's not even going to be a pleasant if then else thing, because you've got to filter out the objectives that've already been done

Does anyone know some long fun (workshop) levels with the 45? im just tryna vibe for 1-2 hours
when a unit is set to cold start do they automatically start up once commanded to take-off?
Yes

Is there any way to make my joystick settings permanent when i load into the plane or for everytime i respawn? Having to change the joystick everytime i die or load in is really annoying...
joystick settings?
Also, this is #mission_editor

Is there an airport editor or something like that for the airports like there is with the aircraft carrier?  When my units are parked at an airport and I give the Take Off command, the AV-42 and F-45s always attempt a vertical take off.  I want to start them heavy and my F-45s are having a hard time getting off the ground.
If it is in the hangar or tent, it will horizontal take off.
If they’re too heavy to take off vertically, they’ll take off conventionally

Hey. I'm very new. I have a little question. Is there a way to start the mission editor without using the vrheadset?
Use the mouse to click the "Mission Editor" button in the desktop game window.
Oh, never saw this xD

Hey guys, i have one question, can someone explain me how the "fire conditional condition" works and quote one exemple of it? Not only the rng usage
In context?
Whatever context, because i guess i can use it instead of use some timed or triggered event but didnt mess with it yet

I mean where are you seeing it?
The mission editor is a big place, and I'm not sure what you're referring to
For exemple, if i Want To use only the if condition (if group tango is landed near waypoint because they are on a carrier in movement = new action is take off) Will it works? Or i have To put else if ou else

For exemple, if i Want To use only the if condition (if group tango is landed near waypoint because they are on a carrier in movement = new action is take off) Will it works? Or i have To put else if ou else
You mean "Fire Conditional Action", or is there a "Fire Conditional Condition" somewhere?
You don't need to fill in the else

You mean "Fire Conditional Action", or is there a "Fire Conditional Condition" somewhere?
You don't need to fill in the else
But you'll only be able to fire the action once, as you'll only be able to fire the event that fires it once

Yep sir, that the way i use it, with global value, so we cant use conditional condition To get the same result ?
You might be able to. I'm just not sure why you would
If you held a gun to my head and ordered me to do it, I'd put a Fire Conditional Action in the Complete actions of each of the three objectives, and each of those Fire Conditional Actions would be identical

Is there a limit to the number rearm/refuel points that can be active on a map?  I have multiple "rearm/refuel point A" spots on my map.  I landed at one, engines off and weapon arm off, but the rearm won't work.  Coms -> ground -> request rearm comes back with "negative, ground crew unavailable".
theres no limit other than like... you spawning 1 billion and it runs at 2fps
did you enable rearming in the mission settings?

did you enable rearming in the mission settings?
Maybe not.  How do I do that?  I was also running with Force Equips turned on, maybe that was the problem.
I unchecked "Force Equips" and I'll give that at try.  One more question, what's the "Bullseye" waypoint for?

@Quantify I dont know if you know anything about this but i downloaded your map and when i try to play it it says "Scenario not found" Any reason why not?
That isn't something I could have caused sadly. Unsubscribe, close game, resubscribe?
Yeah i already tried that, i dont know why it doesn't work

Odd. Others have reported no issues.

Is this an issue with missions/content being uploaded on the PublicTesting branch version of the code,  and then a user tries to download it on master/main branch?
No, that would display a message reading "Incompatible game version". I uploaded and created it on stable
Ah

**so, no one knows whats wrong?**
I ran into this error when I tried to upload my campaign: Upload Error!  Limit exceeded!  Is there a way around this?  My campaign is 4 missions long.  I don't think it is excessive in any way but maybe I'm wrong.  I spent quite a long time working on it, embarrassed to say how long.  Hoping other players can fly it.
Never mind, looks like the problem was the images were to large.  I think I read somewhere they need to be under 2MB.  I shrank them down and the upload worked.  Give the campaign a try and let me know what you think:  The Canyon War by Hard_Reset (sirmac5 is my son's discord user name.  The accounts are all messed up in our house).

Campaigns/scenarios have a maximum size. It’s easy to blow through it with one carelessly unresized image

Hey  I used to know how to do this, but what was the key to cycle through ai units when you're in a mission? Want to observe my scripted units to see if they're doing what I want
While in-game or the editor?
in-game, you can use the Insert Camera, and as it's name indicates, is triggered by the "Insert" button on your keyboard

Is there a trick to setting up the oil rigs so that they can be destroyed by enemy units?  I am trying to set up a protect objective for the player to protect the oil rigs, but can't figure out how to get the enemy units to target the rigs.  Thanks.
A janky way of doing it would be adding a bunker or two on top of it, and if it destroyed, the rig falls
@sirmac5 you can use the bomb waypoint command potentially

Hey, so when making a mission to be used with the multiplayer mod, is there anything in particular that needs to be done? Where do the additional players spawn in (do I just need to make sure there are enough spots or smthn)?
they spawn at airbases/carriers
So I just need to make sure there is a spare slot on a carrier?

So I just need to make sure there is a spare slot on a carrier?
i mean, im pretty sure the mod will spawn you inside an AI even if there isnt :Kek:
Hah nice. Thanks!

I have a question when you create a mission with combat operations how do you balance the enemy to the ally... I mean do you have an ally, one enemy jet or an ally against two enemy jets... ?
Play testing
I personally err on the side of easy, but it’s entirely up to you

Hey, trying to figure this out myself and I think the answer is no, but is there a way to trigger an event multiple times? Like could I have an event trigger every time the player is in proximity to a way point, and if the player enters and exits the radius it would retrigger if they reenter. So far I haven't been able to get it to work but thought I'd ask.
Trying to make SAM radars turn on and off based on proximity
not really

I have a question, so I'm trying to make my wing men takeoff with me at the beginning of the missions, I set the "start action" on my Takeoff objective to command the Unit Group to takeoff and it seems to work just (the lights and engines turn on) however instead of taking off from the airbase I have them parked at, they instead perform vertical takeoffs which take forever. How do I get them to takeoff from the runway?
they also fail spectacular and end up flipping over beacause of all the weapons they carry which is pretty funny to watch
nvm it turns out they have to be inside the tent not in on the assphault outside the tent

Hello just wanted to express my thanks to Baha for this game. I luckily stumbled across it after buying a VR setup and PC for microsoft flight simulator but now have far more hours on VTOL!   Please keep doing what you're doing, wishing you continued success.  I am now starting to experiment with the mission editor which is a great feature, I wondered is there anywhere that shows the ranges of the various radars and missiles (specifically I am looking to compare the different surface to air missiles)?  I couldn't find this info online but wondered if it was visible in a config file or something.    Secondly will it ever be possible to program allied aircraft or ships to launch cruise missiles against targets?  I couldn't find a way to equip it in the loadouts and looks like others have found the same.  Thanks!
allied aircraft can launch the cruise missiles to follow a gps route in a scripted event
i believe its only one of the cruise missiles tho

Can anyone explain to me how to get enemy tanks to move on the mission editor?
you can make paths for AI to follow, and then select the select tanks to follow that path
I don't really know how to explain it but it got something to do with paths

does anyone know how to change the measurement to nautical miles? I don't know meters very well lol
american type beat, ya know
...oh and can I change the alt to feet?

...oh and can I change the alt to feet?
I literally just spent the past two hours making a mission and my VTOL crashed
and saved

what happens if you command a non-vtol aircraft to take off and they are nowhere near an airbase?
im hoping they just try to take off in the direction they are facing
but i highly doubt it

I don't remember but isn't a mission somewhere in the game in vtol to land on a sort of road somewhere?
For like a sort of FARP I think?
I don't remember a mission like that, but with the AV you have to land in a field once and with the 45 you have to land at a small FOB

For like a sort of FARP I think?
I don't remember a mission like that, but with the AV you have to land in a field once and with the 45 you have to land at a small FOB
One of the f45s mission has you land at a farp. But that is only the player, not the AI

When its like this, the next objective starts at the same time as the radio message when the objective is completed. Any suggestions on how to create a delay?
nvm I figured it out
For future knowledge-seekers, you'll need to measure the length of your audio, and start the objective on a delay. Actions are non-blocking, and all action in the same trigger happen one after another on the same tick

Is there a way to force an AI controlled av42c to take off horizontally instead of vertically?
start it in a hanger, or somthing else obstructing it vertically
or give it a loadout that makes its TWR < 1

Would anyone know anything about radio transmissions? I'm trying to get them to play one after another but they either A. Cut each other off or B. Don't play at all
You’re either going to have to play all sounds in sequence in one transition, or play them all in an event sequence, where each one has a time delay
I'll give it a go in a bit. Thanks :greatstory:

Does anybody know how to get the troops to dismount the aircraft after it lands at a certain point?
I've never tried it, but its probably under units/AV42C in question/unload passengers
@Dinner Plate I'm sorry I should have been more clear. I have the AV42 as an AI aircraft part of a scenario that is off loading troops. It lands at the designated spot, but only one troop gets out and he just stands there lol

try selecting all of the individual units?
This is what I use for my AI dropoff in Securing Fjorway: Foothold, the best selling AV-42 campaign, available from all good Steam Workshops
The important point is that there's a Rally waypoint set, and I'm not immediately telling the AI plane to take off again

Question about Campaigns and Steam Workshop:  If I publish with just one mission (for feedback, etc) and then I add more missions and publish again, will everyone get the new missions automagically?
Missions and campaigns are two different things
You'd have to publish a campaign containing one mission

I'm really enjoying creating and testing missions.  I had a situation yesterday where after I refueled, enemy air craft just disappeared.  I'm assuming if I use the Objective type of "Refuel" and then start another Objective that spawns enemies afterward, that would fix it?
Enemy aircraft shouldn't just disappear. If you've got a mission where you can reproduce that, drop it in #public_testing for baha to fix
The disappearance was when the Objective type was Land - I don't know if that makes a difference to you.  I'll test again tonight.

And refueling/rearm stations should also not effect AI?
Assuming you mean the FARP structure things you can place down, they should not affect the AI
It was when I chose to refuel that the current Objective finished and I got the message in my left hand.  Then it went to the rearm/refuel screen and when I came back to the cockpit the AI aircraft was gone.

I assume "the message in my left hand" is the mission complete screen?
Yes
The objective complete requirement is the destruction of the AI aircraft

anyone know if I can make infantry units walk right into a bunker (so basically through the walls, since there are no usable doors afaik) using a path, and if yes, will they die if that bunker is destroyed?
Yes and probably. Paths let you do what ever you want, if you want to get sufficiently fiddly Land units don't block each other in any way. Bunkers require large weapons to die, and anything that can kill a bunker would also kill infantry nearby.
you might as well just remove the infantry once they are inside tho

so i'm completely new to VTOL VR editing, should I drop my link here to get tested and get feedback on?
You certainly can

Any pointers on paths for ground vehicles?  Do the path points need to be on the ground or within a certain distance of the ground?  Do vehicles have a maximum incline they can traverse?
there are literally no limitations
vehicles can fly using paths

Do they have to be very near the first point in the path?
I'm having trouble getting some tanks going along a path, I'll keep playing with it.
Thanks

sorry im back from birthday celebration :)) im glad you enjoyed it and now im thinking of what things i could do to make it a bit more interesting.. more things flying around? more difficult??
does anyone know how well objectives and trigger events work in MP?
to my knowledge, everything works as though the host is the singleplayer player

if I simulatenously tell a parked AI aircraft to take off and to do some other task, eg to attack a certain target, will the take off and then immediately go to doing that other task, or will it just bug out?
i believe if you tell them to do somthing that requires them to be flying, they will automatically take off
but i may be mistaken

has an update to mission editor occurred? and busted it. editor no longer responds to mouse clicks/scroll wheel. Similar in map editor. list boxes spilt over box edges
You stable or public_testing?
Reproduced in public_testing

There is a ground unit behavior called "follow".  How is that used?  I don't see a place to define something to follow.
Also, is there a random despawn mechanism for ground units if the player is far away?
And by despawn, I mean the unit will spontaneously get destroyed.

no

I've used Path because it has you set the path that you want the unit to follow.  If I set the behavior to Follow, it seems like I would select another unit to follow but I don't see that.  Maybe this is a future thing?
I suspect Follow makes the unit follow another unit in the same group in formation
Just checking now

How can I view triggers visually in the mission editor?

I've made a quick tutorial for the F/A-26B as I felt that the default in-game ones were a bit... lacking.

I've had random unit spawing issues as well.  I've found spawning them later fixes the issue. (spawning with timed event or proximity, etc)
Is there a way to run a mission from the editor in some form of freecam mode without having to go into VR so you can make sure the units are doing what they're supposed to etc?

push insert when you load into the aircraft
then i think its [] to switch aircraft

is it really that time again?
Just a straight timer? Would that even be useful?
idk i use the time sequence a lot for making mission.

i've often pondered time delays in mission editor. As an objective type you could have player wait. But i think better if the Trigger event actions (which fire all at once, when event is triggered) had time delays on them like Timed event actions. This would provide more flexibility. as it is I find a use a trigger event to fire a timed event to get a delay - seems cumbersone.   As Skumby says access to a game timer - starts at zero and counts time (say in seconds), then use conditionals to test timer value ... timer > 100, timer between 200 and 300 etc. and trigger events Conditional editor already exists, just need a timer.  with globals can do durations too  @BahamutoD suggestion for an easy add for a future release?

Russia must think I’m gonna invade or something

So I've got two opposing naval forces with carriers. They're both far from their waypoints. I've noticed there's no command like "navigate to unit/unit group" How should I get the aircraft to navigate to the other naval force wherever it is on the map and have them be free to engage the other side's aircraft?
set them to engage enemies
and set a path that interesects or stops them nearby (10-25km id say)

if you can't see the whites of the other navy's eyes is it even naval warfare?
exactly
if you're into that then sure

Problem: this fighter just sits there rather than taking off. It's got a command to take off. What might be the problem?
I've re-checked the logic of the mission. Is it that F-45s just can't take off horizontally from that position?
I think that might've been it. Swapped their starting locations with a couple of Kestrels and it's all working fine now

time for a dumb question! How do objectives fail? EG If have objective to fly to waypoint XXX, objective completes (successfully) when player is close to XXX. so objective is 'live' until player arrives. OR is it that scenario needs some other event to explicitly fail the objective (under whatever condition that tirggers the event)?
Well normally what you would do to fail an objective you would first create a trigger, timed, sequence event and select the action within it and select objective and click on the objective and fail it. But I have a feeling that you are trying to ask something else.
@Red Elite no not asking something else. was just looking at objective and registering (the obvious) how it completes successfully, but that made me think where's condition for fail. Its not in objective! So realised it must be elsewhere viz choose action to fail object in a separate trigger, timed, sequence event. Thks for confirming

What is the best way to put a KC tanker in the air for refueling practice? I tried placing one in the editor in the air with decent enough height (I THINK) and speed but it seems to just crash straight down into the water. Can this be done or does it have to start from an airbase and takeoff?
Send a picture of the stats of the aircraft in the editor
Not near the computer right now. Is there something particular you are looking for?

Not near the computer right now. Is there something particular you are looking for?
Maybe, I have never heard of it literally falling out of the sky, but you might have not done something properly
Ah, wait, I have it following a path!! Is path maybe only for naval and/or ground units? Perhaps it dove down to the path. Its hard to debug things while mission editing cause there is no way to spectate things.

Ah, wait, I have it following a path!! Is path maybe only for naval and/or ground units? Perhaps it dove down to the path. Its hard to debug things while mission editing cause there is no way to spectate things.
Or at least not easily
Paths can be followed by anything

Is the altitude for the path set properly?
Remember that a path overrides the altitude
which is how you can make units fly when they are not supposed to (RailPath)

Oh, what is a path really for?
it will aim for ASL 0
Maybe I'm using it incorrectly.

On a new event there is a "start immediately" or something but then a timer value. So is that like trigger at mission start plus x seconds?
No
start immediately starts the event as soon as the mission loads

Ok, then what is the timer on the actions? Is that between each action or something?
And is it before the first action or after the first action?
The timer is independent for each event

And is it before the first action or after the first action?
The timer is independent for each event
it is relative to the load of the mission

Does anyone have a good explanation of how to put a tanker into a nice orbit for refueling? I used an orbit point but that didn’t work out too well plus the tanker did not adhere to the speeds I put in.
I’d have it orbit a waypoint, but with a really huge radius so you’re not having to pull 3G just to hook up
The speeds in the editor are all in m/s, so you’ll have to do conversion if you’re used to thinking in knots

Do you know of a good radius?
Nope. You’ll need to play with it to find a decent value
Thanks, will play around!!

Have you tried just reattaching them to the carrier again?
Are you actually attaching them to the carrier?

Post the player.log file. There’s a shortcut to it in the VtolVR program directory
@Skumby

Can you restart the game, try to to change the image, then quit, and post the log, so there's less other stuff to sift through?
Ive tried that many times...including resizing and using an entirely different image and format
did you modify the file directly via notepad or something?

Oh i see what youre saying, standby

are you telling the ai to bomb a waypoint without assigned a waypoint?

Regarding "Form on Pilot": I used this to have an AI pilot (wingman) form up on another AI pilot (leader).  Later in the mission I tell the wingman to go orbit a waypoint and I send the flight leader elsewhere.  The wingman does neither and just kinda flys around.  I've tried also setting the Form on Pilot to none but I get the same behavior.  Thoughts?
Is there a way to influence future missions in campaigns? For example if a carrier is sunk in the present mission it does not get put into the next mission?

hey quick question in for the mission editor, what is detection mode?
it says whether you need to see/look a unit to know where it is, or its just always shown on your nav map
i think theres a third option, dont remember

How does that work with the shiny new detection code?
I don't think the new method handles the force modes yet
I'm struggling to get these 4 units to move along a path in a convoy. I set them down in the marked order in a line on the road, add them to a group and tell the group to navigate a path (via a Event), however the launchers pull to the side and the radar truck closes the gap.

What formation have you told them to use?
i haven't found such an option yet, i might be blind

Do example scenarios work?
Only the fa26 and example scenarios work

@BahamutoD above log - new radio knob breaking the game loading in some way? Mission editor stuff, followed by a load of multiplayer stuff
Long shot - if you're able to fly the fa-26 in other scenarios, try giving all the radio knobs a good twiddle, then exit the mission and try your mission editor scenario again
My theory is that their state is messed up in your pilot config, and changing it will hopefully fix it

how does one make aircrafts placed on carrier deck in editor take off in sequence when mission starts?
go to editor events
go to the carrier

Does anyone know if there's a way to use triggers or something to turn on and off various aircraft functions? For example, turn off engines from a waypoint proximity trigger?
I don't think you can tell aircraft to go cold mid-air
but you can use a trigger event for everything else

Building a scenario where I have 2 bombers taking off from airbase as player approaches for landing. Player requests ATC for landing and bombers go to crap. Player log says they're holding short of runway - what's seen is first bomber sitting on end of runway (not lined up for takeoff) , and other bomber sitting on grass adjacent to taxiway. Player lands and once clear of runway, first bomber taxi's across the grass and crashes into a hanger.   Take off events for bombers triggered by player proximity to airbase. I think player ATC request for landing is 'blocking' bombers taking off (conflict for runway).  Is there a way to force AI bombers take off to have priority  over player ATC request to land? Ie player gets told "can't land yet" or similar?
sadly i don't think you can change ATC Priority.
Which map's this on?

Maybe you can ask the player to request clearance if the second bomber is above 30 knots?
players always have priority unless the ai is already on aproach or on the runway
Skumby - my own map.  derbryler - nice suggestion but players are notoriously independent.  Overlord - I suspected as much, but you've got my solution. instead of having the ai parked on apron waiting for player approach, i'll park them on the runway just after player departs.  Thanks all

Is there a way to look at Workshop scenarios/campaigns in the editor?  Just want to learn about the different capabilities and honestly help beat a mission by understanding all the parameters.
it'd be cool to be able to "remix" campaigns
You can't open up a scenario again. It spills the magic juice back into the air and mission won't work anymore

can you put people on boats?
I have confirmed, you cannot put people on boats
I've tried this too (put people on boats) ... it doesn't work. I wanted to have the 42C fly from land base to carrier, pick up people, and fly them to some where else. But you can't have people on boats. I tried taking people to boat and have them get out - they don't don't get out.  It all goes to what Bahamuto thinks the game is about - people on boats is a long way from flying!

I thought this was just about the editor thought?
Well I guess the more you know.
And no that doesn’t work some times. But I don’t want to get into it.

So, I'm new to this, and I wanted to figure out how to create a mission where the parameters were, you infiltrate a enemy-held airspace to sneak in and shoot down a bomber (In-universe holding a high-ranking official), that's escorted by 2 fighters. Is that doable and if so what are the steps?
First I would lay out the map you imagine. Then I would add the bomber with the escorts. You should put them in the same group and let them follow a Path you designate so you can decide if it flies close to your airspace or deep inside their own.
Then you should add SAM sites. With a radar and launchers on high positions. Then you have to decide if you want a wingman or go solo. And you need to add an Objective and set it to destroy, set the bomber as target. But I think you should do how you feel. Just add some things, play the mission and add stuff you felt was missing.

I'm looking to use a way point proximity trigger to spawn in an enemy aircraft, and each time you fly through the way point a craft will spawn so long as there are no enemy aircraft still alive. does anyone know a way to repeatedly spawn in aircraft like that without having to place tons of them, basically just using one asset to respawn it over and over again?
sadly i don't think you can do that.
There are custom missions where the bandit respawns when you fly to at least 9100m ASL so I think there may be some way to do it though

Alright, welp.. Do un-spawned units have a noticeable impact on performance while un-spawned? I'm about ready to put in this work lol
It does have some impact as far as I am aware
its negligible

Can trigger sequence nodes be activated repeatedly? Or do they just trigger once and they're done?  For example, I'd like to use the radio knob to set a global value based on it's volume output, 10% = 1, 20% = 2, etc. Then when global values equal a number and your landing lights value = 1, spawn a set type of craft based on it's corresponding global value. I can get the dial to set global values once, but then when I come back to those volume based values nothing seems to happen. Trying to make a volume knob selector switch that changes global values associated with different types of craft to spawn in using landing lights as the trigger to select your choice from the knob. Basically in plane ai spawn controls, but I'm not sure a trigger sequence will work the way I'd like it to. Any ideas on a work around, or if this is even possible?
triggers can only work once
nothing repeats

I also work with global values and so far I use seperate events. That means I have a buttload of triggers. Maybe you could set up multiple triggers and increase the value each time you activate it. So group one activates with global value 1, group two with global value 2 and so on?
That might just work, I'll see what I can come up with later today. Thanks for the help guys!
Once I upload a Campaign to the Workshop, if I need to make a change, how does that change get to the Workshop?

Once I upload a Campaign to the Workshop, if I need to make a change, how does that change get to the Workshop?
If I upload from the Mission Editor, it creates a separate version in the Workshop, which isn't what I want.
If I upload from the Campaign selection screen, it doesn't seem to update what's in the Workshop.

Wait do you mean public testing?
Yeah.  My install of VTOL VR was the public testing version and I created the Campaign in that version.  Then I reverted to the stable version and tried to update the Campaign.
oh yeah i highly suggest you don't do that because there is no frame rate limit for me so it just maxes out my GPU and CPU and i get like 1132+ fps.

No
Sorry I was just doing something

arent there steamvr plugins that do that as well?

Anyone know how to get units to follow each other in the editor?
I don’t believe you can
If they’re in the same group, they’ll move in formation, but that’s it

what does 'getting take off path async mean'?
sorry didn't mean to paste/post all this detail
Where did you place the bomber.

Does 9 have a path?
no. log seems to indicate  inbuilt path being used - 'AirbaseNavTaxiRoutine' just to complete description bombers are not spawned on apron, they're spawned on a taxi way and have separate event at start up to taxi to apron - this occurs OK. later another event triggers take off. I previously had taxi paths for bombers to take them onto runway with subsequent event to takeoff - same thing happened - didn't take off. I didn't check log previously to see what was happening.
So have you set the bombers as take off on default

how can i set a waypoint or path with my carriers? Image
You’ve not posted an image, so I’m going to use my imagination
Once you’ve created the path, the most reliable way to get units to file it is to create a Timed Event that Starts Immediately with an action for the unit/unit group to move to waypoint or follow path

how do you make an entire group do something?
I have a sea group that I want to move in circles
I'd probably use an event trigger sequence and add a ton of nodes that tell the ship group to go to the next waypoint in a circle of waypoints. the entry and exit conditions between actions being their proximity to the waypoints, and the event actions having the group always navigate to the next waypoint in the circle. do that over an over again until they circle as long as you need them to.

Question, I've made a path for this bomber to follow (For a mission where you're supposed to take down the bomber before they land), and don't see a way to get them to land from the path tools?
Or really, slow down or anything?
You need to use events to make them land. They will contact air traffic control to request landing. If there are unoccupied parking spots, they will be allowed to land and park.

Put a waypoint along the path at a reasonable distance from the airfield, then set up a triggered event, on the bomber’s proximity to the waypoint to give it the land action

How do I make a mission available to all planes?
You don't

Yeah, and then the player could override with the Mod menu when they are ready to start the Campaign?
yeah if you load a plane it pops up in the vehicle select for scenarios in the editor.

I'm struggling to get MBTs to follow a path over a bridge.  Is there a secret to this?
Several of them will drop into the water below.
Ground units are completely free of path finding. The group leader will follow the path, and the rest will form up in formation around them

Regarding a ground unit being "detected": what does that mean and what are the mechanics for it?
is it shown on the navigation map
if its always discovered, you can always see it on the nav map, otherwise you have to get close enough or lock it to "discover" it

Can I begin an Objective, complete it, and then begin it again later?  This is via a triggered objective.  I might want to use the objective repeatedly in a mission.
Nope
Skumby - I've seen meanjeans' question multiple times. I can understand why you might not want to repeat an objective (given conditions around objectives, prerequisites etc). But the same answer applies to events - why can't an event be reused/retriggered, IE if there's something that allows event to be made active again. Things like trigger conditions can simply re-occur and the actions re-actioned if possible (same as when event is first triggered).   I guess I'm asking is there technical / Unity issue that prevents this or is it just Baha hasn't coded that way?  Just curious!

No technical reason. It's just the way it works currently
Having events and things repeating makes things more complicated than they need to be for the vast majority of situations

Ta! Doesn't seem more complicated to me (I'm a novice Unity user).  Simply 're-enable' event (ie make it available again), and if trigger conditions re-occur,  just redo actions. What am I missing?
The edge cases
The complications needed for the UI to make it usable

I’m trying to fix an issue with Op Restore (AV42-C). The blue infantry will not board Player’s AV42-C so objective will not complete. Player’s AV42-C was somehow removed from BoardableAircraftFilter. Any one had this issue or have a suggestion?
yeah sometimes that just happens I don't know why but I think it might be something to do with the path finding.
Thanks. I’ll revisit the path to see what I can change.

Are you giving the infantry any other actions to perform, even if you think it can't possibly trigger?
@BahamutoD Are the floating waypoint hoops used in the Hover AP tutorial something that can be produced in the mission editor? Same question, but for the video playback and the control-anchored video playback?

If there is no other bases available and I have an allied carrier in the ocean, will the player default spawn on that carrier?

you have to put the player on the carrier manually through the carrier selection.
Thank

Im there, and for some reason theres not a player select?
Oh I see
click on one

Can I have that play asset in some random spot on the map and as long as his spawn is set to the AC were good?
yes
setting the carrier spawn moves the player spawn to the deck

Heres another question, if another guy joins and spawns what happens to him?
like in mp?
Yes

Is anyone aware of any co-op cas missions that are out there that would suit 2-3 players in A10's ?

Yeah i've played that one before, just wondering if there might be any others :Thonk:

does anybody know why my mic commands wont work in custom missions? they work in all the dev made carrier practices but whenever I try and use them ingame it never works.
in game meaning in a custom mission^^ im talking about like requesting landing at carriers and such, hate having to use the MFD
What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?

What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?
Request landing/takeoff and calling the ball. I read the wiki so I know you have to preface it by saying the name of the carrier but still, only works in dev made missions. never works in my own customs.
What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?

What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?
"Aircraft Carrier Two, Requesting Landing"
Hull num is 2 name is Aircraft Carrier and its unit 0

is Aircraft Carrier Two the exact name?
or is it zero two?
I can double check but its just named Aircraft Carrier, the unit number assigned to it by the game is 0 and i changed the hull number to two

or is it zero two?
I can double check but its just named Aircraft Carrier, the unit number assigned to it by the game is 0 and i changed the hull number to two
you have to use the name of the airport

So try leaving off the two and just saying the rest?
Thank you btw

As far as official multiplayer goes, no one knows, as it’s not possible yet
^, I assumed MP mod then

Question, is there a way to force F45s to land with wires on the carrier vs them landing vertically? Don't think so but just curios if anybody's found a way
They’ll land conventionally if they’re fat
Thank you

anybody know a way to make friendly/enemy icons disappear? referring to the red / blue indicators around units

so in the mp mod could you have one player in the F-16 and one player in the A-10? also how do you create multiple spawns for players in the mp mod do you just put a couple player spawns or
yeah if you both have the mods loaded
sick ty ty

Thinking about trying to make a mission for a friend and I to play together (using the Multiplayer mod), are there any limitations to what you can in a singleplayer mission compared to making a mission for the multiplayer mod?
yes
objectives can only be completed by the host, unless its something like "kill x" or maybe going to a waypoint

How do you make player spawns for people other than the host?
you can't
Then how do other people spawn in?

Then how do other people spawn in?

Is there a way to force enemy planes to maintain a speed until they've done a bombing run? The idea is that a bomber squadron appears to attack the player's carrier and they must intercept and destroy them before they reach the carrier. But they're flying super fast so it's hard to catch them
And can you make them fly in formation until they spot any hostiles?
If you create the flight path of the enemies to fly in formation, but keep the engage enemies box checked in their settings then they will break off and engage once they detect you on radar

And can you make them fly in formation until they spot any hostiles?
If you create the flight path of the enemies to fly in formation, but keep the engage enemies box checked in their settings then they will break off and engage once they detect you on radar
Unless they’re incapable of engaging you, like a bomber

Do I have to path each one individually or will they fly formation on one path?
If you have them in a unit group, and tell the unit group to follow the path, they’ll move in formation
Awesome, cheers guys

This guy won't attack the F45 on the carrier deck (5km right in front of it). Anyone know why?
Set a timed event that starts immediately and tells him to attack it and for the F45 to take off as well
What weapons does the ASF33 have equipped?

Is the carrier allowed to attack enemies?

No, I want it to be kind of a cinematic start where a stray fighter kills the F45 onboard and then buzzes the carrier before retreating to it's base.  So I disable 'engage enemies' until 40s has passed

I would hope they'd not use the bombs, but that's a neat edgecase
laser bombs can still be dumb fired i think, possibly the AI will use them as unguided bombs

can you make av42s land on a crashed unit? Like if i shoot down an enemy unit, can I force the av42s to land where the crash site is? kinda hard to predict where ill shoot it down at

can you make av42s land on a crashed unit? Like if i shoot down an enemy unit, can I force the av42s to land where the crash site is? kinda hard to predict where ill shoot it down at
or id set them to land at waypoint
you can set a waypoint on a unit, then set up action for AV42 to land at that waypoint when unit is destroyed. (It might right on top of crashed plane). However, waypoint might not survive once the crashed unit 'disappears'. it might survive when unit is destroyed. Idk what will happen - never tried it.

Don’t know if I should put this in mods or not, but when I try and make a mission for the a10 wart hog mod I click on the a10 plane after I load the mod but it says I’m still using the av-42c. Am I actually using the a-10 or no?
Just set it to the fa-26b for modded planes
No

Where do I find my campagins in my vtol vr files? I see custom scenairos, editor resources, n stuff
wait
actually nvm found it

Geez @Skumby  why so caustic? I'm  not being malcious or trying to mislead,  was just trying to help. I never said "Land at Wpt" objective worked as I suggested. While you're pointing out a deep subtlety between waypoints (1) and (2), both defining fixed waypoints or setting waypoint fields in events and relevant objectives, both  lead to (2) NAV lines and HUD icons, so to flight experience seem to be the same thing.   But agree with you " there is no way to make a (1) waypoint (defined in editor) follow a unit. They’re fixed points set in the editor "
 The join objective says "If the objective does not have a waypoint set, it will automatically be set to the [Target Unit]." which what I think Yoboy was looking for - a way to put a 'waypoint' (type 2 to be sure) on a unit. Similarly why I showed screenshot of proximity event, where the 'waypoint' can be set to a unit. The screenshot I used (of Join objective) is from a mission I have. Once objective is triggered the waypoint icon appears in HUD and follows target unit, and NAV green line appears.  Which confirms what you said "Some objectives can have their (2) waypoint set to a (1) waypoint or a unit in the mission editor".
ok
@YoBoy further on my suggestion of setting (I hestiate to use word) waypoint to the unit that going to crash. I tried it, the waypoint continues to exist after the  AI plane is shot and is going down, but disappears once the unit hits the ground and is destroyed .... so is not a solution to your problem. Sorry if i mislead you.

dose this work with enimy units?
it should i dont really use it that much
ok

Does av42 land and take off OK? Might be too heavy once troops are loaded - check TWR.  To drop troops you need to specify a rally waypoint near the landing site where they assemble once they dismount the aircraft.  Not had problems with pick up troops using 'board aircraft' event. got to specify in event which aircraft to board. I guess troops need to be near aircraft and selected aircraft is on the ground.
have specify which troops to pick up as well.
Screenshot your events

Unload troop command. Then remove waypoint then add a reset way point of path?
OwO A-10 ground strike mission uploaded with a new idea I had?

But

Are you referring to the sound of the gun firing after the rounds impact? Because if so the reason those are delayed is due to the speed of sound and because of that, the pilot would not hear staggered firing sounds
pilot doesn't hear that, the first sound you hear in videos taken from the ground are the rounds impacting, then the sound of the gun firing because the rounds are supersonic.
damn here i was thinking that was a reload noise of some sort

Hey um, when making a mission how do I 1. Make wingman that Vertically take off and follow you, and  2. Make other aircraft take off then follow a path?
Using timed events

Hey um, when making a mission how do I 1. Make wingman that Vertically take off and follow you, and  2. Make other aircraft take off then follow a path?
Using timed events
Stack up a Take Off with a Form Up On, or a Follow Path (actual action names may vary)

Do I need to give them a taxi path too?
Nope. They'll handle that themselves assuming they're in a vaguely sane position
When you tell the wingmen to take off, they will automatically choose vertical or conventional, depending on their load weight.

Alright, and if I wanted a group of like, 7 26's to take off, would I have to time each individually or would their AI know to taxi automatically, when set at a base?
They'd handle it automatically
Queuing up on the taxiway, waiting for their turn

And another question, any way to get a bunch of friendly aircraft upon take off to fly in a formation towards their target, or like, for an assault context would it be better if they just scrambled?
Could just have them fly to a waypoint to start with, then give them the attack action when they got closer
They'll automatically break and engage if they see something to kill, or something attacks them

Is there a way to spawn the same units twice?
what like copy them?
The same ones

@Dinner Plate just curious - why do they need to be same unit and not a copy? a new spawn could be made identical except internal mission editor unit number - from player's point of view it will look the same.
I was trying to see if it was possible to make an infinite scenario
If I can’t respawn the same exact unit then the mission cannot be infinite

well, then why not use that?
I wanted to see if it was possible to effectively create Hoggit Georgia at war, while Cheeses mod would make it infinite, it wouldn’t be dynamic
You can make it to be dynamic

Can anyone tell me how to add modded aircraft to my custom scenario's? When I click scenario info all that shows available for player aircraft is the 3 default aircraft.
Most custom aircraft use the fa/26b missions
Just select fa/26b

i've set up a rearm/refuel point unit in a custom mission. but everytime I land on it and request rearm/refuel via comms, the voice response is request denied (in various phrases). I've got engine off and ARM is off too.   why don't work? Is there a trick to using these units (there are 4 varieties) ?
is there a bug with duping carriers that have stuff on them?
nvm about rearm/refuel point issue.  I worked it out. mission was a joy flight and so I didn't have  Equipment Configurable set in Scenario Info. So ground crew reseponse was correct - can't rearm/refuel (I only wanted fuel) if your plane is not configured for it. Was duh moment for me.

Hey, quick question about the mission editor. Say I got 4 AI planes in the same flight group and I want them to follow a path. Do I need to create a path for each or can I assign them all to one path and will they stay in formation? I am assuming it's the latter but I can't find any detailed info on this 🙂 Thanks!
You can use an event to give the unit group an action to follow the path
It's not something that the default behaviours can do

how can I change the player's vehicle?
im making my first mission
you change it in the mission info

Units have action 'Set Invincible' - can you later 'Reset Invincible' ie make them take damage? Can't see an action for that.
I just want to prolong the fight a bit
surely set invinciable has a true false argument? i haven't used it tho

surely set invinciable has a true false argument? i haven't used it tho
didn't think of that (and didn't look either). I set up dummy action and yes  ... that's how it works!  Set Invicible is the action and you set it ON (check box) or set it OFF (uncheck box). Thanks
does the ruler measure the radius or the diameter? I assume radius but i don't want to be wrong would be a big difference

well you assumed correct as it measure the radius

in some missions (eg in The Island) there's lot of radio chatter - pilots saying they're going after baddies, evading missiles, 'Fox Two', 'ejecting' etc, Is this generated by the AI air units, or must be set up with Radio Messages events/actions?  If done automatically by AI, is there some options on units required to be set?
Thats the AI wingmen telling you what they're doing
if they get shot down they"ll say theyre ejecting or if they shoot theyll say fox 3

Are units and unit groups considered 'All Alive' if they haven't yet been spawned? I have an action triggering with a test for Allied: Alpha Is All Alive when they haven't been spawnd yet!
@Quiggles Yeah I know but I'm getting no audio  from AI units - how do you get the audio? Do they have to be wingmen? In The Island, they're not wingmen (I think)!
i think they have to be in your group but im not sure

@Quiggles Yeah I know but I'm getting no audio  from AI units - how do you get the audio? Do they have to be wingmen? In The Island, they're not wingmen (I think)!

thks Quiggles I'm not sure either - in the preloaded missions The Island (preloaded with VTOL VR install) you join up with unit group of 3 x 26B 's, they shoot the shit out of the baddies and talk about it (on raidio) but I don't think  you (as Player) join their group.   Anybody else have understanding about audio behaviour of AI air units?

There’s an action you can use to hear other aircraft radio calls
thnk Skumby (good we over past shit). Is this the 'Set Radio Comms' action? How does it work - so if I enable 'Set Radio Comms' for unit X; I get (player gets) voice commentry from unit X - is that how it works?

seems like action only works for individual units, not unit groups!
if the ai aircraft are in the same group as you, they will call out by default

is there a way to change which aircraft a mission is using retroactively? just making a mission ahead of time for the helo and I was wondering if its a waste of time even trying ahead of time
yeah you can
hopefully this would work on the AH

yup

subtitling, why? I dont know
custom voice lines mod could be neat actually. anyway sorry for offtopic
i litterally did this for every single comm type already (except ground)

Could we also get new features for the basic editor? I find it useful if specific data from a unit can be read, like it's altitude, it's attitude, it's speed, etc.
or at least see who's talking
can we move this to like #vtolvrdev

I think those are only on completion, right?
Yes
Money being pooled with the team vs per player as an option would be nice

Because I can't say I have
i swear you never need to use it unless its really complicated

Also can you set a global variable to be equal to like, the amount of units currently in mission?

global variables can only be messed with directly

Also, in the naval strike wen interceptors are sent out every like 5 minutes, did he just spam place the units or is there a better way?

Multi plane spawners for continuous action. Waves of enemies every X number of minutes
Maybe it already exists, but circular logic that lets you return to previous objectives could be interesting. You could make objective-based tug-of-war pvp missions.

It could be added in later, right?
Possibly
Likely

Being able to change aircraft mid-mission. Might seem weird, but say you spawn in a AH-94, clear out the defenses, then someone can respawn in a f-35 with a strike package. It honestly might be possible out of the box just by hitting respawn when you think you're ready to change aircraft - so maybe a triggered event that can enable new spawn slots? (That can then lead to large MP battles with spawn spots being enabled/disabled based on captured bases, etc.)
Is there still no unit spawner in the mission editor? 😦
> Hi is their a way to have random selection so in other words have say 3 enemy fights all 3 are taken off spawn immediately and so that when the player enters and area that 1 of the 3 will spawn but randomly so different each time they played so it spawn the same all the time  Someone emailed me asking this. Does anyone know if its possible?

@. Marsh.Mello . So you want one of the three to spawn each time, but a random one?

@. Marsh.Mello . So you want one of the three to spawn each time, but a random one?
I took it as they had three possible spawns and wanted one of them to randomly be picked.
maybe he could use a trigger event using the chance % for spawning in the units

@Skumby I tired the alt spawn but couldn’t get it to work, do you have to change or add something in the alt spawn? And do you need a conditional % for unit to spawn?  With chance even with 2 enemy’s and 50% sometimes you get nothing spawning could you give more pics if you get it to work thanks
How do you edit the briefing slides in a custom mission. I can find the description and mission image but not the spot for the briefing
you should find it all in the edit tab

Is there a way to hide all the UI within the editor?
i don't think so
Ah dang

How Does the alt spawn percentage work ? So with spawn 1 that is their at the start it is set at 100, but I cannot change it , then if I set spawn 2 to say 50 and spawn 3 to 50 how does it work with spawn 1 at 100
those are weights. 100 is just an arbitrary standard.  if all alt spawns are 100, then they all have an equal chance of being selected. if 2 and 3 are 50, then there's a 50% chance spawn 1 will be selected, and a 25% chance for spawn 2, etc
Re creating missions using the helicopter - I don't have helicopter (yet) and when create mission in mission editor - helipcopter not available in Scenario info. Also there's no helicopter AI either. IDK if this changes when have DLC helicopter.

Is there a way to keep placing the same static object in the mission editor?
Copy it
Kinda annoying to have to go back into the menu

I don't see a Copy button anywhere? Is it supposed to be next to Move, Delete, ...?
Guess there's not a copy button then

Ok

When we get custom mission support for mp, how will skins work? Will there be like an option for the unit on what skin they have or something else?
When using the alt spawn, if I sync the group, it will add the spawns to the other members, which makes sense. However, it doesn't copy the other units' spawn options over to the new ones. I know I can work around it by defining them separately first, but I feel like this is an unintentional behavior.
Workshop support for skins would actually be cool.

Is there a hotkey for the move command or do I have to click it every time?
Awesome Thankyou
Im trying to set up a unit group to spawn after 3 other objectives are done and I am having trouble setting up the action for it.

Anybody know how to change your players callsign? I know changing unit group but what if i wanted to be Echo 2-4 instead of 1-4? If that makes sense
sadly no way to do that
this is pain

Got a big an94 mission coming out tomorrow's.  Anyone wanna do voice work? Hmu if u want in
I wouldn't mind
I, uh, don't have a voice reel handy but I'm sure you've heard my voice as the AWACS on the F-45 co-op

I see.  So there could be more than one objective going at the same time?
I've always done them in sequence.
Yeah, you can have as many objectives active as you want

Cool. And remember, if you come across other weird stuff breaking, always ask yourself, "how can I use global values to fix this?"
Global values saved my marriage
what

Do you have to shut the engines down on the 42 for infantry to board?
Nope
just open the doors while being relatively parked

Shouldn't I see all 42's in the mission as an option?
Can infantry ONLY board AI 42s?
no

Can infantry ONLY board AI 42s?
no
what does that even mean

In other words, how would I get the infantry into my 42?
Do I have to use Pick Up and Drop Off objective types in order to have infantry board and dismount?
Hey folks How would one go about scripting/modifying an RCS test mission like this one? https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763453407 I'm hoping to test the detection range for various AH-94 loadouts And against AI planes as well, if possible

Searching around the discord and found your reply, Can elaborate on how you got the AI AV-42C to properly unload infantry? I have mine setup with infantry in seats and with a sequence to land, unload, and return to orbit waypoint but it gets as far as landing and then immediately taking off again, and also straight into the ground rip.

This. The board aircraft action is only for AI. You need to use objectives for them to board and deboard the player vehicle

All actions under an event are executed at the same time. So if you’ve got an event that lands, disembarks, and takes off, the AI plane is going to get super confused

Just so I understand right, all nodes in a sequence are executed all at once if no enter/exit conditions are set? That is currently my setup.
Yeah. If you don’t have any conditions or times, it’ll do the whole thing at once
Understood, that makes sense, Last question from me is what the exit condition should be for unload? To make the AV42 wait for full disembark. I don't  see anything like "is Empty". Fallback idea is a simple timer but I generally like to avoid dead reckoning if I don't have to.

I use a proximity trigger for the infantry on their rally point that’s activated once the ai plane has landed
I figured there would be a better way than a dead timer :) great idea thanks

Why could it be? It's a smallish PNG.
There’s a possibility is putting an error message in the player.log file
I still havent a single clue on how to use global values

can I start the editor without going into VR?
Yes
If you start without a VR HMD plugged in

Is it possible to create multiplayer missions yet?
Nope
we're still waiting on them

and I believe the modded MP doesnt work anymore, is that correct?
nope
unless you revert to an old version, but I don't see a reason to

Hello, i've been trying to get an AV-42C to load up, take off, fly a path, land at a waypoint and unload. but the AV-42C gets as far as completing the flight path but doesnt attempt to land and just flies off. Is there something that i am missing to get it to land at a waypoint?
You don’t have any energy or exit conditions, so it’s doing all the steps of the sequence at once
I just had this exact question as well recently in history, check out the above for some more insight :) https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/930300229381681162

you dont put those on your maps?
Same lol
Anyway to make it so the av-42c uses vtol when it’s an AI instead of automatically doing regular flight speed?

No, to both

whats the best way to create a "wait" objective
like if i want the player to chill for like 1 min before giving the next objective

Doing some isolated AI experiments to learn about their behavior/functions... I have noticed that AI, when grouped, will stay with their group even when only one unit is given an instruction to move while the others are set to "parked" behavior. Is there any functional difference between this and using the UnitGroup Move Path? This then also asks the question what does the "follow" behavior do?
I think its kind of an escort for Plane
Groups used to automatically form up immediately even in park. Baha made a fix that they will stay in their original positiin until any move.. after which the group will form up.  I think follow is more there for following players.    Really no idea why group moves are a thing when any group unit causes the whole to move...

Hey.. question. How long does it take for MAD4 sites to deploy and what series of actions need to be ordered to transfer them from path to able to engage?
like 5, 10 seconds maybe?
"Stop" and "engage enemies" don't seem to do it. They stop and their radars go up, but no scanning.

that should be good enough

Trying to do some kind of IADS behaviour?
Eh, the point is you already destroyed the EW site and got a jump on them. I don't want it to be too hard.
👍

Can I launch the mission editor directly without going into VTOL VR or do I have to launch it from the VR menu then switch to pancake? 🙂
you can in pancake
I must be missing something 🤔

On that note, is there a launch param to skip right to mission or map editor? I noticed you don't need to keep steamVR running once you're in either. Can I skip the steamVR step?
yes
...and that is, please?

hey does anyone know how to upload missions to the workshop with custom audio included?
its that easy?
Yes

what do you not have you audio included?
BGM will save
And so will custom voice lines

i have no friends... can anyone tell me if the audio works in this? https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2717323816
well you can test it your self if you download it from the workshop
it's the same file.

Btw does anyone know when the ah-94 is coming to the mission editor?
AH-94 is already available in the editor
It was available when it launched

How do you "Set Disengage" after a "Set Engage" action?
LOL and a few more questions after that?
Well you could have classified that you meant AI helicopters because there has been no announcement on them other from “his working on it”

LOL and a few more questions after that?
Well you could have classified that you meant AI helicopters because there has been no announcement on them other from “his working on it”
I also meant “ability to fly custom helicopter missions” because it’s impossible to launch the ones from the steam workshop

Is you game on the right version?
Most recent update and I own the DLC. I can see them when I click on the workshop tab but there’s no option to launch them
I’ll try again today, haven’t had time since the weekend

Is there something broken with the mission editor when you go to launch your mission? I just started working with the mission editor today and it never loads my mission when I choose that option.  I have to completely restart the app and pick the mission from the custom missions manually.
Just tried it again and didn't have a problem this time.
I'm trying to do something that I think should be simple, I'm just trying to get some rocket artillery trucks to fire on a waypoint.  I've created a timed event, chosen "fire salvos on waypoint" after no delay.  I can tell the event is doing something, because the trucks "aim" at the waypoint, but no rockets are firing.    I've set the shots per salvo to 4, and the number of salvos as high as it will let me , 120.   I also set the reload time down really low, (5 seconds).  But I'm just not seeing any rockets launch.e

are you using allied or enemy bunkers? the enemy bunkers are destroyable but take a lot of damage
the allied bunkers seem more resilient than enemy bunkers but i have not tested it extensively
if you want to give more options to busting bunkers, you could place a soldier inside the bunker and make its death the trigger for the destruction of the bunker

could it be that the target is below a minimal range?
oh hey doombox, fancy seeing you here lol
Oh hi lol

So when you get into the vr headset does it just be a black screen for steam vr?
Or the app itself
Yeah it was a black screen and the monitor was stuck on a “darkened” version of what was on there before.

Are you using a link cable or no?
If you are using quest
No. RiftS.

how do you delete units in the editor?
Select them on the right, then click delete in the top right
ah! I'm so dumb. Was expecting to have such a button in the unit details panel. Or Del or Backspace keys to work.

wait alot of mission don't do that?
wait oh for mp
None of the MP missions do that.

I’m guessing there’s no way to right click and drag a box thing to select multiple units?
well you can use groups
True

Is there an easy way to update a map already on the workshop?
Just put it on the Workshop again
There isn't any more detailed docs than what's in the Wiki for the Mission Editor, is there?  I'm starting to make progress with my custom mission and running into some confusion over how units following paths should work, but the docs i've found are kind of lacking so i'm not sure how to make them do what I want them to do.

Mystery solved

I'm working on a mission where I want to have a "don't go there" zone.  And I'm looking for teh most effective way of killing the player (without just killing the player with an event)  In other words, how can I launch a whole boat load of missles at the player if they go into a forbidden area?     My initial attempts at this (multiple SAMs) in the area, etc, just isn't producing the "volume" of agression that I'm looking for.  Any advice?
you could use an event where if the player goes near a waypoint or unit the unit could engage the player.
that's basically what i'm trying, but I don't see the action to engage the player...

set engage enemies just toggles the engage enemies checkbox on the unit, right?  Which I already have checked.    I did get it to fire missles, but I'm looking for a very agressive, they all fire at once kind of thing, but it seems like when you tell the AI to engage it's smart about not wasting all it's ammo at once...
Thanks for your attention, by the way @Red Elite
sadly units can't use there entire arsenal at once.

but what's with the problem?
Only problem is I still need to figure out what I was just doing wrong with the SAMS just now  I was just testing with a single RADAR and SAM (hooked up to the RADAR), but it wasn't firing.
I got one to fire yesterday, but for now, the IRPACs will be good for my prototype.

is it set to engaged?
Yeah the units were set to engage enemies.
is the equip set to none?

is the equip set to none?
No, it was equipped with the FLKM-100
wierd

What is the difference between Path and Rail Path Unit Behavior?
There is no difference now
Before there was, but regular path was buggy so I made it just do the same behavior as rail path, but kept the old option to let old missions not break

Yeah I noticed that too.  Do ground units follow the path more precisely , is that how you get them to drive along roads?
Question about Proximity trigger, the checkbox for "Spherical radius" when unchecking that, does that imply **cylindrical ** radius instead of spherical?
yes

Thinking of trying out the mission editor, are there any decent tutorials for it? Also for the helicopter is it possible to do any type of pickup missions like the VTOL plane with the bay?

Where would the picked up people go?
Well I remember an oil rig mission where you take them back to the base and I did the derkaderkastan campaign and that have a few transport missions too

where would the people go?
Like on the aircraft
they'd have to sit outside on the wings

Either way though, are there any decent tutorials out there?
Although a nice compromise would be escorting another vehicle carrying troops. Just like the idea of some logistical missions to practice flying the heli

I am wondering if this Timed event will do what I'm expecting:   Here is what I'm hoping to accomplish,   I want the same unit (golf-rocket-1) to fire 1, 2 shot salvo at 3 different waypoints in sequence.     Are the actions inside of an event run in sequence?  Or is having 3 actions for the same unit in the same Event within an Event group going to do something weird, like only execute the last action?
ignore the "22" typo in shots per salvo for the second action...
is it activated by anything?

is it activated by anything?
Yes, It will be activated by another trigger, right now I'm testing by checking that box
Which brings me to another question... Anybody have any good tricks for testing without the headset...   I've Figured how how to go into debug mode (Ins).  But is there some setting I can apply to the player (Heli) so that it just hovers in one spot while I watch my event logic unfold?

you can always use the autopilot
I'm not sure what you mean by that, I looked for actions I could apply to the player, like "enable autopilot, hover, etc" but all I see is this.

Uhhh, what just happened here? (Video) Camera broke when I was adding an objective briefing 😮
did you accidently press INS
(the insert key)

Ha! I must have! Is that a feature? What does it do?
funny enough we were just talking about that. @_provector
LOL 😆 Ill read back some messages so

For the enemy bombers why is it that when you set them bombing location and have the right altitude.. why do they suddenly start dive bombing or just diving and they never drop their bombs?
Hmmm Tried to do a sequence event to get what I'm looking for and it is not working as expected. Notice that there are two Nodes, each with 3 actions.  What I'm expecting is that all the actions in the first node Will Occur at the same time, and then all the actions in the second node will occur.  But what is actually happening is that the last node is happening.  It's as if there really is no sequence to the sequence event, or the sequence is "give this asynchronous order" and move on to the next.   How can I stop a sequence event from progressing from one node to another until the Actions in that node are done executing?  I know I could try to hack it by adding in delays, but that defeats the point of using a sequence for me, since I don't know how long the actions are going to take, I'd have to tiral and error them.
I looked at entry and exit conditions, hoping that maybe I could put a "if unit is idle" entry or exit condition so that it only moves on once the units are done executing their orders, but I don't see anything like that.

Also anyone know the max range on enemy rocket artillery truck?
I think the wiki says 32km for that
So it can reach 24km..?

So it can reach 24km..?
Wait here I’ll check thank you!
there are no conditions for after a action is completed, you can only make a condition for the results of an action i.e. killing a target/group or getting in a position. if you're just shooting a waypoint you can place a dummy target which destruction triggers the next sequence or do it with timers as you said. also consult the https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor/Events for information about conditions and events.

Thanks @Mr_Crusoe , Ive definitely got that page open in my browser as I'm working on this.  For now I can use the delay between nodes approach, which is working OK, but not ideal.  Your suggestion of using a dummy target brings me to my next little stumbling block.  I've got the sequence running with the delays and now I want to be able to repeat the sequence.  I tried Begin(ing) the Event I'm already in to start it up again, but that didn't work.  So I tried Begin(ing) a different event that just begins my main event again and that didn't work either.  So now it makes me wonder whether any event types (timed trigger or sequence) are repeatable?  I don't see that limitation mentioned in the Wiki, but it would seem to me so far that I can't run an event more than once (from my experimentation)
Nothing is repeatable
I think it could be cool to have something where you have to use the A2G radar on the Heli without the eots

But theres no way to force turn it off right?
Issue is to employ weapons you still need the TADS (or I guess you can use GPS weapons)

Does anybody know what type of serialization the mission .vts file is in?   I can get around the "nothing is repeatable" issue I have with events by creating more complex events, but doing so with the GUI will not be fun, but it would be easy for me to edit the .vts file directly... Even easier if I could do it with some code.    I don't recognize the format at first glance but it looks like a cleaner version of JSON (no quotes).
Would'nt be suprised if it uses the custom format baha made

Yeah it is

Do you say that by just looking at it, or do you know for certain that the format being used is custom.  I ask, because even though we don't recognize it as a very common one (JSON, YAML, etc) it might still be something common with the toolchain that is used to develop the game?
Im fairly confident, iv used quite a few formats and never seen this, and looking at the game code I *think* its fully custom
Ok yeah it is custom

Educate me on this... Is the code for VTOLVR open?  Or do you have access to
im writing a vts2json just for the fun of it
No and no, but you can decompile the code and take a peak

What is it developed in?
All method names retain their original names, and the decompiler is quite good about guessing names to things
Unity/C#/mono

found some rando parser maybe? https://github.com/taniwha/cfgnode
But the config node class thats in vtol seems to be not as an external project
Yeah, maybe custom built by the KSP devs and then "borrowed" by BD?

@BahamutoD Any info about the VTS file format/how we could possible parse it and work with it?

@BahamutoD Any info about the VTS file format/how we could possible parse it and work with it?
Well, that worked like a charm.  Since I can't repeat the event, I just opened up the VTS and edited it by hand to "unroll the loop" and run my sequence 3 times instead of just once.  Worked nicely.  That will work for me for now.
Is there some sort of official place to make feature requests for the game and mission editor?  Being able to repeat an event, or have a sort of rudimentary "goto" capabilities within an event to allow for some repetition would be really nice.  But I suspect that the engine needs to support that sort of thing before you could add anything to the editor.

Repeating is something thats been asked for a lot recently, but suggestions are normally best in #vtolvrdev
are you asking about adding c# to it

Cities Skylines to .vts export wen?
@Red Elite nice detail there!  and as far as "amateur" i'd say "beginner" is more appropriate....
the maps in C:S are 18x18 km, they're incredibly small

Is anybody old enough to remember Sim Copter and how you could import SimCity (2k?) cities into it?
I would LOVE to be able to fly around in Cities Skylines maps...
uhh.  you understand there is no x shape building in the map editor

Anyone know max range on MPA-155?
~~their file format is more proprietary than actual Paradox content lol, good luck exporting them~~
the game was pretty shallow... a lot of "pick up this person", "hose down this building that's on fire" stuff. but was still fun.

Anyone have a topdown image of the vanilla campaign island? Or know how I can source it from files?
akutan?
Yup that's the one

nice... but shouldn't that be in #map_editor?
Oh whoops, thought I was in there 😄
anyway nice map

wouldn't it just be easier just to open it in notepad?
it is on the right
But, now I can translate VTS to JSON

Thinking about doing a mission where you either first scout out targets and mark GPS coordinates of stationary threats (airbases, FOBs, SAMs, etc) and then RTB and attack them from high speed and altitude. *Or,* you are assigned a scout taking and wingmen (/other players eventually) will attack. Is it possible to use GPS markers in missions this way for use in forwarding the mission? Like a specific marking, not simply just *target->is locked in TECAS/TGP/EOTS*
My thinking is realistically you only might know an area of movement of the enemy, not specific targeting locations
uhhh is dev talking about something else?

uhhh is dev talking about something else?
Yes red   want to give the AH a use in scouting as well, not just attacking but forward assistance and tactical aid
oh i though i was going crazy due to the time

can you change the detection mode in the editor events?
because i cant se it
I’m still unclear what that really does

“Is a target point set? Sent? Ok good we will hit it.”
It’s up to the players coordinates to be good if they want a kill or not
Buddy lazing would also be nice one day

Are they marked force undetected?
how the fuck do you know there is a road block in my mission

is it possible to play custom missions with friends?
not yet
What are the options for sharing a mission with someone to betatest?  I assume if I uplaod to steam workshop it's publicly accesible?  Or can I set it to friends only?  I'm getting close to having something worth sharing with a select few people to help me play test the mission, but I don't want to put on the steamworshop until I work out some kinks with it and record some real radio audio.

you can always upload it and set it to unlisted or friends only or just send the zip files over discord

Has anyone done the sneaky IR launchers in your terrain masked valley before? Just wondering how well it works
so, i made a mission for MP that had 88 MAD 4 units in total.      There will be more, run
how does 208 sound

Hey, ive been playing around with editor too, however it seems to just be for single player missions, how do i change to multiplayer and add the appropriate spawns?
mp missions have just released today in the public testing branch, expect nothing to work lol
Still too many

Out of curiosity, is there a way to force or restrict players to only one team? (I want to make PVE scenarios)  I would like to avoid the trouble of having players join by mistake the other side, since absolutely no considerations will be made for team B as team A is considered the default for PvE scenarios
Obviously i don't expect things (and features) to work yet, but i'd like to stress test things a bit and setup the foundations of the missions so to speak
I'm not sure I understand how the new mission editor for MP is supposed to work? We can still only spawn 1 player spawn and I am seeing 0 changes on the UI to help us place spawns or change their team

Someone mentioned a shortcut parameter that will launch VTOL VR straight into the mission editor, does anyone know what this is please?
I've checked the wiki to no avail.

I'm not aware of any such thing

is there an issue with the editor button on flat screen?
it launches VR and switches audio devices
Which is a minor inconvenience, but someone mentioned a shortcut parameter a few days ago. If it's not a thing, that's fine.

anyone else having a problem with mission not loading in the editor?
been here for like five minutes
The log'll likely have some errors in it

Is the 8 per team likely to change at all?
is there any way to respawn units apart from spamming copy/paste?
I hope not as that would be a lot of traffic to one computer

16 players factored in at the moment. If I can put all 16 on one side for a PVE mission I'll be happy.

Can you explain that further please? I know what the UI is but curious to see what the limitation might be.
inb4 the briefing room just isn't big enough 😄
There's no scroll bars

Can you launch a MP mission from the inside editor?
Nope
Mp isn’t in the editor yet

I may be just missing the obvious, how do you enable rearm on a carrier?
you don't?
should it be automatic? Was just watching a mission tester land on the carrier and get "rearm not available", Landed on the elevator.

should it be automatic? Was just watching a mission tester land on the carrier and get "rearm not available", Landed on the elevator.
Engine off?
It worked for me by just plonking a carrier down

Not sure. from the vanilla missions it would prompt you to turn your engines(or weapons) off, right? instead of the straight "rearm not available" text. But yeah sounds like it should just already be available, thanks, I'll play around with it.
:catshrug:
if it's for an mp mission, it could be possible that you have to go to your spawn to rearm

Alright I'm done converting one of my weird mission to MP, with kind of a complex logic, no issue so far as host. **The biggest grip is steam workshop not updating fast enough when you upload a version up**. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2723033273&searchtext=

it is in public testing

Hey I am trying to play a bmg but when I pick the clip it wont play, I checked the clip itself and it works fine
Also whenever I try and choose bgm it wont let me save the game for some reason. It makes me "Save game as new copy" or something

Define "works fine". Is it a mono or stereo audio file?
As in when I open it up in my files it plays fine. When I add it to the bmg it dosent play
Probably an issue with it being a mono file, then

So its the file thats the problem?
Just tested every other file I had and those dont work either
Open it up in a program like Audacity, if it looks like the top file then it's mono, if it looks like the bottom one then it's stereo

How is the 94's free flight map called?

needed quick updates from baha for some features

I am not sure then, @BahamutoD while you're here do you have any ideas? They are trying to play an audio track as BGM but it refuses to load (and I think messes up saving?)
They can play it as a music track though
What is the audio file?

What is the audio file?
Well I can play any audio clip thru radio but literally nothing works thru bmg

Did you turn off BGM volume in settings?

To get your player.log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows Key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log". 4. Upload this file into #public_testing, or whatever channel you are asked to do so in.

Is there a way to show players how much Global Value is left? I want it to appear on the objective MFD page. But if it cannot, I want it to show on system message.
You could print it every time a trigger condition is true

Is there a way to show players how much Global Value is left? I want it to appear on the objective MFD page. But if it cannot, I want it to show on system message.
You could print it every time a trigger condition is true
so for every value it can be:

Question.. what even is global value and how do you use it?
It is an arbitrary value that can be used to do literally anything you want
An event can increment or decrement it's value

How do you use them?
Wait do you have to know how to code?
Nope

Wait do you have to know how to code?
Nope
you just need to know conditions

thing a complete? increment or change value x
value x =/>/< y? trigger event b
perhaps you want to keep track of the number of objectives a player has completed

value x =/>/< y? trigger event b
perhaps you want to keep track of the number of objectives a player has completed
with each one, you increment a value by 1, thus keeping a count that can trigger other events or objectives

Through a redbull-fueled rampage and the help of you guys here in discord I created my first 3 missions involving the helicopter DLC over the last 14 hours non stop. Much thanks to my friends for actively testing (and still currently testing) as I developed. If anyone would like to help test that would be greatly appreciated, The third missions has yet to be tested, but the other two have been and are confirmed in a playable and apparently enjoyable(tm) state. I intend to improve these over time (better briefings, robust edge case logic, balance) but the baseline missions are done. Thanks again! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2722787658
What a champ.
hey guys. i asked in the steam forum if its possible to crteate a mp mission in the editor. they said in the public testing it is possible. so i went into that but i cant place more then one player spawn. is it rly possible to create a multiplayer mission and if so, what am i doing wrong there? 😄

You need to start it as a multiplayer mission
A mission can't be both single and multi

how do i start a mission in the editor for multiplayer? i havent seen a button or anything for that 😄
You need to create a campaign
There's a Multiplayer tickbox next to the aircraft selection button

so its not working in the standalone mission tab? that explains why i havnt seen that 😄
Does that mean we can only have one aircraft type for mp missions
No. It means you can't select aircraft type if the campaign is multiplayer

how can i trigger a mission complete thing for a mp mission?
I assume it works the same way as it does for single player missions. Complete the last active objective
ah allright 🙂

Is it possible to open existing non-user made mission in editor? I am curious about AH-94 "Surprise Attack" mission...
No
k

You making a single player mission?
If you're making an MP campaign, the launch button is non functional.
Because launching multiplayer missions from the editor doesn’t work

MP Mission Editor - is there a way to embark infantry onto a player VTOL that I'm missing at all please?
like form up?
or engage

Is that SP Mission Editor or MP?
yeah that might be a bug for mp then
That's fine 🙂

Is there a way to spawn units in the game or do I just have to have all the units placed but like, deactivated?
yeah turn spawn immediately off
Oh but I still have to have the unit in the game already? I can't dynamically spawn units?

Oh but I still have to have the unit in the game already? I can't dynamically spawn units?
then you spawn it using an action
correct

Do all helipads have a rearm function or do I have to add that somehow?
i think a rearming point is a unit? i cant remember
There is a Ground Support object  called "Rearm Refuel A / B / C/ D"

Ahh cool thanks

Can I not add funds to the player in a mission?
I did a sample objective which rewarded funds and it only rewarded part of it and only after I left the mission
I've created a very simple practice mission in a multiplayer coop campaign: * 2 x F/A-26B (player spawn) * 2 x AV-42C (player spawn) * 6 x Enemy Tank To try it out, do I have to upload it? (I believe "Launch Scenario" doesn't work for multiplayer yet). Thanks

The mission might not work, so I feel a bit bad about uploading it...

@Vampaca I saw your comment on my campaign and I'm sorry to hear that you had trouble. Would you be willing to help me test the missions at a later time, perhaps this weekend, for the new updates? I haven't updated them in almost a year and a half but I have recently realized I still have all the required files.
Is there a way to place more player spawns for a coop mission? or is there another way you place the spawns/etc?
You can only create an MP mission by creating an MP campaign, once you do this you should be able to place multiple MP spawns

Thats very helpful, I was in the standalone mission editor, Thanks!

How do you make a multiplayer campaign?
Mission editor > campaign > check the little box that says “mp” or “multiplayer” I forgot what it says exactly
ahh i figured it out, wasnt on the public testing build, thanks again!

Were you able to solve this issue?
lol spoilers
:blobaww:

Is there an allied ground unit that can swim? 🤔 thinking of an amphibious landing...
No 😦 I wanted mobile radar, but it seems broken. Actually their is a dirty work around, make them start in Engage : True, and order them individually (not the group) on start to Engage false and follow a path , the mad radar will stay deployed, but it will move. Then when you want re enable the Engage enemies on each unit.
Nice finding. Definitely seems bugged. In my tests if engage enemies was not checked in editor before mission start, It would simply never deploy in missions under any circumstance. Even with just a simple timer event without moving.   Do you know if the radar still function and ping the player while it's moving with that work around?

Yes  the radar is active  when up when the mad-4 radar move and ping you.
It really hope it get fixed

Or you can exploit the bug to have mobile radars giving info the SAM ?
Actually it be nice to have a Stop to Engage option on them, similar to tanks
Thats pretty mucj what I was trying to do when I discovered this bug lol. A MADs patrol group that would sort of stop to engage but otherwise was on a constant loop

Does a sequence simply not run more than once?
the alt spawn is only for individual unit too 😦 it be sweet for group
All events can only occur once

what does sync does tho, it spawn the whole group on the same spawn pos?
or it keep their position relative in the formation?
No

or it keep their position relative in the formation?
No
😛

What's the setup for the other members of the group?
sync group too
When you tick the box on the group leader, it creates an Alt Spawn entry for each member of the group for each alt spawn for the leader. You then need to assign each of those alt spawn entries a location

On a semi-related noob note. If I have 8x infantry dudes, and they are all in the same group, will they move in a formation by default/behave as a unit at all?
It'll be difficult to get them to NOT move in a unit
They'll move in whatever formation you tell them to

Thank you, is there a place to set that group formation behaviour?
Use an event
Think it's on the Unit Group

if i read properly, each alternate spawn has its own move order behavior ?
I don't bother with the default behaviours, so not a clue
let me try quick

Unless there is way to know on which alt spawn the group has spawned  to send the proper event?
Proximity events would be how I'd do it
and there is no triggered by Unitgroup 😦

Do funds earned from objectives only get added after the mission is finished?
dumb question, is there anything specific I need to do in order to flag a mission as multiplayer compatible? I have alternate spawns for the 'player' unit but idk if i'm supposed to do other stuff
MP mission must be in a new campaign that is checkboxed as multiplayer when initially created. MP spawn positions are their own type of unit. You must be on the public_testing branch currently to create a MP campaign. Note that you currently cannot make individual scenarios MP and it must be a campaign.

ah ok cool

do you know where the default missions and campaigns are saved?
They’re not openable or editable
ah alright

I’m going to try and make a COD mission for the AV-42, is it possible to have cargo in a mission in some form or just passengers ?
Someone else may have a better idea, but my solution to that would be using a global variable for "cargo loaded" and use waypoint triggers/timers to "load the cargo" at pickup location and "unload the cargo" at dropoff location.
That sounds good enough to model it

Heyo! Any way to get passengers to hop into multiplayer aircraft?
hey guys. is there a way to trigger the spawning of enemy aircrafts with the comms tab? so i have to get into comms in the MFD and then i can spawn them?
want to do that for a practice mission

using conditional

ah so when i turn on the strobe lights for example i can spawn them?
yup
ty 🙂

how do I remedy this?
what is the unit?
all of them

how do I place  a player spawn point?
sorry this is my first time using this, im just trying to build a mission so I can practice dodging missles because im struggling with that xD
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2189296631 this could help

Anyone know if it's possible to set wether respawns are allowed in multiplayer?
Not yet
you got multiplayer stat tho, so you could force finish the mission when too many player died

Anybody know if there is a way for steam workshop to force sync faster? (other than unsub/sub)
I was outlining a possible mission I might do later, does anyone have something to add as a vague objective possibility?

Question about multiplayer campaign editor (on public_testing branch) Is there a difference to "upload to steam workshop" in campaign overview or mission editor? From campaign, would it upload all the missions? Thanks
it should still upload all the missions and it would be uploaded under multiplayer campaigns
Thank you. I added a briefing image and the objective waypoint to the mission, but neither of them showed up. Do the subscribed campaigns/missions automatically update themselves? I couldn't see a way to check for any updates.

If you want to update a mission you just have to press the upload button again and it should automatically update it
Steam workshop is kind of slow. you better unsub/ resub your campaign every change :/

Does anyone know if funds rewards only matter after a mission?
Iirc they can be granted for completing objectives
I have them but it seems to only matter to campaigns. Like you only get them after the mission is completed

Off the cuff curious, other than funds, is there a system for structuring munition or fuel availability?
I have a great idea but I need to be able to reward funds in the same mission
MP coop campaign (public_testing) "Easy Missions"
 1st mission "Destroy the Tanks" works fine.  2nd mission "Intercept the Patrol" doesn't work as intended: * I was unable to make enemy planes start in the air * I created an enemy carrier and put 2 planes on the deck (with an orbit waypoint) but they didn't take off.  I'll see if I can fix it later today. I'll try setting the planes to "take off" (they are currently set to "orbit").

What did you set the airspawns to?
I've set their default behaviour to TakeOff. They have an orbit waypoint. Hopefully they'll fly there after taking off.
Not sure what you mean by "airspawns". I'll have a look when I'm next in the editor.

When selecting the mission... I see the mission image, but to the right is an "image missing". I see other missions sometimes have an image there (a terrain map?), but I can't see a way of adding an image there.
There is campaign image, Mission image, Briefing note image, if that help
Thank you. I've set images for all of them - campaign, mission and briefing (I'm using the same image for mission and briefing). There's still an "image missing" to the right of the mission image. I'll have another look after work to see if I've missed anything. I'm on public_testing. Campaign is "Easy Missions".

its a multiplier mission too, you are sure to have lastest workshop version of it?
what you mean latest workshop version? its my own i created 😄 everytime i upload it to test it, i get the newest 😄
you get it from the workshop manually?

Yesterday I found that uploading the *campaign* didn't update the missions (after a de-sub and re-sub too). Uploading the *mission* seemed to work. However, it could be that I hadn't allowed enough time for the *campaign* uploading to register.

So did you upload it on public testing?
Yes
Weird

Hey guys, i'm trying to make an online mission for the steam workshop and im trying to launch the scenario but it says im missing spawn points even if i have multiple. Any suggestions?
you cant launch a mp mission sadly
you have to upload it and play it through mp

is there an way to make a single player mission into an mp campagin?
well.....
well you could add this to the campaign file but thats a guess

quick question: If you set a trigger event to be enabled and conditional, can it only trigger once, or will it always trigger so long as it hasn't been deactivated and the conditions are met?
well i don't actually know but i think you can create loops as i accidently created a loop and after the game started my game crashed
Rip

you guys think this is enough air defense?
Your RWR is going to sound like an orchestra
Anyways I got this carrier in an MP public testing mission, with default behavior being navigate path, that path being the yellow line running under the carrier. However, for some reason the carrier refuses to move

is there anyway to make an AI AV42 or F45 hover in a mission?  The Nav Speed action seems to have floor setting  60m/s
No
there's a "CONVERT TO MP" button in the campaign edit window

Are you within 25m of the objective when you come to a halt?
yes
I'd jack it up to at least 200m to be sure

btw, is there a way to copy an entire mission to make the same mission again but with little tweaks?
Just copy the file/folder, if you're careful
You want to not copy the workshop info, so that it won't overwrite the other copy of it on the workshop

Missionathon? Lol that's pretty much what I did for Misc-Missions the day we got public testing MP. Thatd be a fun thing to try with a few people with a start to finish time and then play
"Mission jam"

How many aircraft can the assault carrier hold? Dosent say on wiki
6
Thank you!

Hi, anyone know the range (and conditions) at which infantry will shoot at each other?
I'm sure I had this working on previous MP missions (infantry were shooting at each other).
Now it seems to just be the tanks.

did their visual range change?
Maybe?
mk1 eyeballs

They can at least see armor, are you sure they won't *try* to shoot it?
hmm
they will attack then

it will not engage tanks with its gun?
Yeah it wont
Which seems almost like a bug...?

Here's a question: is LOS blocked by buildings? (for ground units)
Does anyone know where I can find the smoke effect object thing in the mission editor
System -> System -> Light Flare

How do you make an AWACS for Team B?
good question, they have one in Naval Strike coop mission
and the F-45 one as well

maybe the unit isnt avaible yet in the mission editor?
But thats kinda hard when I cant place a AWACS for Team B
I guess

the unit is here, maybe it was left out of the selector by accident?
baha pls
pls baha

Also, why are the External 120s in the 45 not the 120Ds?
I thought that was fixed :thonkery:
Atleast in the editor its the normal 120

I'm new to using the mission editor.  I noticed that some of you are experimenting with MP missions in the public_testing branch.    I'm trying to decide if I want to play around with that now, or wait for it to go GA.    So I'm just curious as to how long things usually sit in public testing before they get released?
like a couple of months or less
Baha has mentioned planning on making the PT -> Stable cycle quicker

Did they remove the drone launching cruiser?
no
What about in public testing?

What about in public testing?

When you add 3 radio messages like this will they que up from the top or play all at the same time?
They will queue
If you choose priority radio message, it will interrupt the previous message instead of queuing

So it wil start from the top down?
Yes
Thank you!

Rocket artillery are not firing. Target waypoint area is about 750m away. Could this be too low? Or could buildings be obstructing a clear shot? Thanks.
It's likely the arty's driver cab is blocking the shot
Try rotating them so they fire sideways

Interesting... The rocket artillery are now about 3km behind the front lines. They are each placed on top of a hill. Their rockets are landing way too far behind the waypoint target area (about 3km!). Could this be due to their high elevation?
On my next pass, I'll try setting the rocket artillery to just "Engage Enemies" rather than that plus "Fire at Waypoint Area". (Perhaps altitude of the area waypoint is taken as the altitude of the firing unit, and engaging enemies will take the altitude of targets into account).
If you want you can set each arty to a certain smaller waypoint. I recommend maybe put them on a semi flat elevation. If they are at too much of an angle they might not be able to aim properly.

hey. i want to have an E-4 Overloard in the air. i dont have a friendly airbase on the map. can i spawn it in mid air so its instnatly there and flying?

Is the campaign set to MP already?
if not, you have to make a new campaign and make sure to tick the "multiplayer" setting when creating it

Are you in the public testing branch?

please hold

Have you created the campaign?
yes
and converted to MP

what target group do i have to define to send a mission waypoint to the gps of the player? (singleplayer)
what?
wait i send a screenshot 😄

so putting the waypoints into sequence should fix my problem?
I’m still not sure what the problem even is
Or what you’re trying to do

You’re sure the event/objective is firing?
yers
yes

What does your GPS screen look like afterwards? Screenshot please
its just empty
hmm how do i get the mission to show up on my list once i saw it?

Multiplayer or single player?
What enemy units can attack the carriers ingame?

What enemy units can attack the carriers ingame?
like anti ship roles?
rocket boat

Oh, as in the enemy naval units?
Yo
Anyone know how to fix this issue ?

Anyone know how to fix this issue ?
I am not entirely sure, I think the LMSS ship can use its forward missiles to sink your ships
yo-yo

Looks like the only way to remove a unit from the map is to use a "kill" action. Is that true?
You can delete them
Unless you are in the mission you can setup a kill action to get rid of em

Seems strange for delete to not exist. You bring units to a waypoint next to a building. Maybe they go inside?
The bombers really need lot of clearance to land on airport :/ otherwise they just hit mountains on the alignment
I'm confused

Also, in the MP editor, is there a way to give command of AI units to only one player? Or is it for the entire team
Does anyone know how to launch mp custom games without uploading them
You can't

With the multiplayer officially coming out can we make multiplayer mission and campaigns in the editor yet? Also if we can make a mulitplayer mission in the editor can we make it so the players can fly more then one style of aircraft? Can I have say 2 Helos and 2 airplanes?
The multiplayer missions editor is in development. If you want custom multiplayer missions, check out the public testing branch
Ok thanks. Ill keep my eyes open then.

Timed Event Group  * Begin Immediately (check box) - if checked, the event triggers immediately when mission starts. * Intial Delay - if "Begin Immediately" is not checked, then this sets the delay until event triggers. * Time (s) - applied for individual actions? (added to the initial delay).  Have I got the above correct? Thanks
No
The initial delay is the delay from when it's triggered to when it starts trying to fire the sub events

Is "Time (sec)" applied per action? Is it the duration of the action?
After the event group has been triggered, it'll wait Initial Delay. After that, each sub event is entirely independent, and will wait Time (sec) before firing all the contained actions at the same time
In your screenshotted example, it'll Begin Immediately, wait 0s initial delay, then wait 0s Time(

Oo on that note, can you confirm what "is/is not destroyed" means for the rigs? I haven't gotten to really test it, you can destroy parts, you can also destroy the leg support and make the platform uneven. When is it actually considered "Destroyed"?
when the oilrig is tilted it is considered destroyed
awesome thanks, that means I have an issue elsewhere with my triggers not firing

How do you add in player spawns for the test branch multiplayer missions in the editor?
like in the normal version
you cant add in multiplayer player spawns in the normal version

do you have to do something special before it shows up?
i dont think so
A mission can’t be both single and multiplayer

What is the 'allowed slots' slider do on the ah94? is it for the copilot?
Not for sure, but I assume it's Allowed slots: 1 = only pilot appears as a slot in MP lobby. Available slots: 2 = both pilot and gunner appear as slots in MP Lobby.
yup

what will happen if i add more?
not supported (aka bug, unintented behaviors, and crashes)
i wish the player slots were not locked to a spesific vehicle

Does it still show the mission as 8 player in the list tho ? Like if you have 8 f45 + 8 FA26
ok so now i have a custom mp mission. how do i play it?
you have to upload it to the steam workshop and play it through the games mp function

ok so now i have a custom mp mission. how do i play it?
you have to upload it to the steam workshop and play it through the games mp function
oh

how do you play it? its uploaded, i have it downloaded but i cant select it. only can vote, uninstall, or view info
im idiot
Start a lobby, and choose it

What's it called? I'll load it and debug it
multiplayer testing or something like thhat, no icon. made by 16
i reload the game to see name

@74 It had separate briefings for each team right?
oh lol. yeah.
Ok, well temporary workaround until I fix it would be to make it only one briefing

did you use "copy" options on the mp spawns to make multiple mp spawn?
This is the bug that killed my "Land War" Mission. AH-94 pilot seat goes to F-45. I believe this is related to copy/pasting the MP spawn unit. Haven't been able to run it to ground yet, but that is my current assumption.
If a trigger sets a bomber to bomb a waypoint, will a nearby player cause the bomber to abort? Or will the bomber continue on its run?

If a trigger sets a bomber to bomb a waypoint, will a nearby player cause the bomber to abort? Or will the bomber continue on its run?
IIRC the AI will do its duty unless it is engaged (e.g. the player starts firing missiles at it), then it will evade
If they successfully evade they'll go back to whatever they were doing

@Hoizen  do you still have the mission with the glitch slot that put you in the wrong plane?
yup, haven't touched it since last tested broken. CO-08 Land War (1) in my coop mission pack.
how does it look int the vts file§

Does that unit instance ID show up anywhere else?
Negative. Only two helos: 215 and 216. Both unique IDs.
Can you reorder the spawn id to match the slot list or vice versa?

Can you reorder the spawn id to match the slot list or vice versa?
Currently matching, though I can test the reverse next upload.   215: AH-94 216: AH-94 217: F-26 218: F-26 219: F-45 220: F-45
I need to proof check all my mission slot now just to be sure 😄

so peaking at the vts now... spawnChance = 100, I'm assuming this is default for Alt Spawn 1, I know you can't change it in editor UI... if I changed it here... does it turn into a chance to spawn at all? Assuming not... but that would be very nice to have :P It would be nice to have a quick probability to spawn or not spawn an AI at all.
it s easy to test in sp 😄
just remember that if the mission has been loaded once; you need to reload the game to take the new .vts change

Anyone play around with budgets with MP campaigns? Is the system supported?
didn't tested
can someone help me im trying to make my mission multiplayer by putting it into the campaign editor but I made it on standalone mission and cant find how

Are custom static scenery models supported in the mission editor? (Or the map editor I guess)  I have an idea for something to add to my mission but it won’t work if I can’t make a simple custom model to add.
Btw I was super excited to see I went from about 20 subs to 200+ subs in the last couple days, so now I’ve got extra motivation to make it worth the players time for hitting that subscribe button!
When I launch my scenario in multiplayer it just loads an endless black screen, could someone help?

When I launch my scenario in multiplayer it just loads an endless black screen, could someone help?
No
Thanks @Skumby , are the any options for getting creative?  For instance, are there any models that can be placed by hand editing the map or mission files, that don't normally appear in the editor?

Not that I know of
Mission creators, please, for god's sakes, don't make 15 min straightline heli flights in your missions they're really not fun

anyone know where a guy can get a mission thats just the target practice mission with multiplayer like the freeflight/airshow mission?
I’ll be making one inside of a map wide city for ah-94
Performance be damned

Hi, when I try to test a multiplayer campaign mission in the editor I get the error, that I need to place a player spawn point, I am using the public_testing branch, is this a bug or do I need to place something other than a MP Spawn?
You cannot test MP missions in the editor. Only way is to upload it and test it in-game
ah okay, thanks!

Performance wise, does a ground unit is less expensive on the cpu than a air unit?
Good question. my hypothesis says yes. Sounds like a SP mission stress test time.
tried with 50 tank vs  50 aircraft, but i need better tool to check the perf change than cpu charge which show the same

what if you added another 0?
100 tanks on path
100 planes on orbit:

Does anyone have any documentation and or videos pertaining to making Multiplayer Missions from the basics ?
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor
Anyone know how to fix a blackscreen for when you start a mission?

Anyone know how to fix a blackscreen for when you start a mission?
Thanks.
v1.3.5p1 Multiplayer     - Fixed: black screen when trying to launch a multiplayer game with more than 8 slots on a team with separated briefings (added Separated Large room)

you got too many slot?
Ah
Yeah

what I mean is there's no need, that seems pretty conclusive, yeah?
its not trouble, and it be more accurate
with just 100 tanks vs. 100 jets, a difference of 1.4x is big

Ooi, what are the stats for a completely empty mission?
speaking of which, i think theres an issue with the KC-49, 75 KC-49s perform much worse than 75 MQ-31s
i will try and get profiler data some other time

How many aircraft is there in the mission Naval strike?
It be nice to have a performance cost in the editor , based of unit index and how many spawn from the start.
I'm trying to a make a multiplayer mission on the test branch, but I'm running into a problem uploading to steam. I've added 3 MP Spawns for each team, but it's giving me a 'No player spawn.' error.

or if there's something else I need to do?
can only test them after downloading them from the workshop
Yeah, but I can't figure out how to *upload* it

your campaign has been created with muptiplayer box checked?
That or maybe just get an initial spawn set
also editing .vts file might require game reboot to load  the change properly

Is the mission even inside a campaign?
no, it's a standalone
I don’t believe that’s allowed

There's no point in setting refuel points at airbases, correct?
They're usually meant for FARPS and places that AREN'T at airbases, no?
or tanker

but yes

Is there anyone here ever worked with the custom scenario assets mod? If so could someone tell me if it’s possible to upload workshop content with custom assets and how difficult it is to make custom units?
Also is it possible to make custom missions for multiplayer PvP yet?
Did you read the mod description?

For anyone also having this issue, I disabled the mod loader then revalidated the game files, and it fixed the issue.
Anyone know what 'StayInRadius' behavior for ground units does? I know what is sounds like it should do, but not seeing how to set what radius to stay in haha.

hello mission makers. does anyone have out a mission in which you go into an area and evac soldiers under fire? i've been practicing my j hook landings in the chopper and want to try it out in an evac mission. thanks in advance.
Is there an easy way to take photos for the briefing in the mission editor?

Check out the wiki page for the mission editor, the debug options like free cam and time manipulation might help.

Cheers, yeah just found something about that. Gonna see how to enable it now @bradtank44

I want to get some good screenshots for the image panel in the briefing notes to polish up my mission.  What is the best workflow for that?  I could just play through the mission and take screenshots of the s-cam, but is there a way to pause the game to enable better control over the s-cam for taking the screenshots?  What workflow do you guys use to get good screenshots for your missions?
lol!!!
Insert cam

are you talking about using debug mode instead of launching the mission in the headset?
You cannot launch a mission without a headset
well you kinda can

Do you have to do something specific?
From the mission editor, choose "launch->launch scenario" (CTRL-L)  Choose your pilot, etc. In the "locker room" Just hit the "R" key onyour keyboard and it will jump into the game without you putting on your headset.
then hit "Insert" to enable that debug cam you spoke of.  Then keys like [ and ] to switch units, etc are all active.

Anyone having trouble uploading to the Steam workshop?
When I upload nothing happens and no new mission was uploaded to Steam's workshop.
Tested it with the example mission and it worked. Don't know why mine doesn't even load the UI for uploading.

dang. so it wont let you put that as an objective and finish it with the ah94?
If you have a AV-42 and AH-94 in your mission that s fine
I think it can be simulated. I'll be doing just that to emulate the silly ladder pick-ups of Desert Strike in my Desert Strikes Back campaign. Can't wait to see if it works out :LUL:

can anyone clarify what is the difference between "path" and "railpath" for ground units? As far as I can tell, it seems to have something to do with getting things to move on roads?
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/931756308019945502
whoops, guess I should have searched first

Will only one of these events fire, or is there a chance to fire the first three?
Only one will fire, chosen at random, but it won’t be there even 4 way split I assume you’re expecting
Yes

So, for example, 33% would be 33% and 49.5?
33% for the first, 50% for the second
You are splitting a split cake

I'm doing mission edit, and when I select audio in the briefing screen, can I continue to play the music that was played in note1 in note2?
no, each note stop and play on each slide
hmmmm so sad

Can someone send me a link to instructions on how to add multiplayer spawns for players?
Step 1 is to be editing a multiplayer mission
Where is the option for that in game? Or do I need a mod?

Where is the option for that in game? Or do I need a mod?
You need to be on the public testing branch, and create a mission in a multiplayer campaign
ohhh. ok, i'll try that. Thankyou.

Did I cover all the bases?
If I set the detection mode to force undetected it should make enemy aircraft not detect it right?
Just made a co op mission in the public test branch. I was told you needed to make it in test branch so you can add multiplayer slots so I did. Now none of the aircraft slots can rearm. There are no weapons to choose from. Did I do something wrong or is there a specific work flow I need to follow? Love the game btw guys.

Force detected/undetected only applies to what the player can see on their NAV map

At the beginning of the mission.

Is there a NOT gate?
only "AND" and "OR"
we need nand and xor

Noob to the forum here. I'm having a problem with some enemy armor floating in the air when I load some of my custom missions. They float high, like 4000 AGL. They're still operational, the SAM shoots at me. And other units start driving randomly, either over the moutnains of Akutan or into the sea. Does anyone know how to stop all that from happening? I'm trying to finish off a campaign.
So I have to publish my milt-player mission before I can test it because it doesn't show up in the multiplayer  menu.
how do i make a mp campaign

On another note are unit movement speeds in the editor (for ground vehicles) in knots?
all in metric
POG

Thats a very beautiful map, I'm a VFX artist who has fallen upon this beautiful map and mission editor, I've got my first solid mission complete, and very short campaign planned, but for sure need to look into maps like yours. Did you use a height map for that, Saybro?
na i think that one comes with the game
Ahhh cool. At work, I use all kinds of amazing assets, and I am just dying to apply that to this.

Wow man, holy crap, Thank you, how nice is that of you? Dude, thanks. I used the Map editor to make my own and use a few sat map shots of Syria to create my own chunk for my first stab at using the Mission Editor to really tell a real life story to the player as a part of that story. I cant stop finding things in the mission editor that are surprising me, I've wanted something like this to use for a while. Thanks again, you are too cool, thank you.
There's one other thing I kind of find I need, and dont know how to make happen. I need a Reset - or Repeat node in the command tree. I really would like to be able to have a string Reset, and be able to be Tripped again, perhaps with a TIME delay box like many of the other nodes have. It would be beyond useful, to be able to have a message that could be tripped by Proximity alone, and display a message, or play a radio reply. Is that functionality there somewhere beyond my couple days work so far? I use nodal systems like this at work for years and years, so within a couple hours I had most things working, but couldnt find that functionality.
No. There is no way y to fire an event twice. There are no loops

Damn, thank you so much, I asked once before a few days ago, but it seemed like it might be there, thank you for the answer.

I wonder then, would there be a way to cascade the effect, have One, turn on another as it is tripped? So, you would stack the pile, with the top tripping the next, tripping the next, etc?
Kind of a Faked repeat
It would be so nice to just have a node at the end before Output and was a reset with delay, soooo useful

Ohhhh!!!!!!! Cool, ok, I'll try that today. So, you would have an Event, thats trigged by an event, but, is there a Delay to activate node so its not a line of firecrackers?
Check out the sequence event type
If I wanted a sound by proximity, but, the player would have to break the proximity barrier to make it happen, Each Time

any reason why im not able to test spawn?
can t test in editor
Nah this is base game, not gonna get into map editing. It's for one of the F/A-26B missions I believe in the campaign

I know shift is the fast button (faster movement, rotation, etc.) of the cursor but is there also a slow button? I tried alt and ctrl. Ctrl seems to prevent the cursor from moving
Does anyone know why units arent following paths?
can you elaborate? units should be able to follow paths

Does anyone know why units arent following paths?

I have a tanker drone set to a path with t points so it just flies back and forth over 20 miles. I have that set as it's default path and I have it's behavior set to follow path. All it does is circle the first point. The path is on a loop. And it's 10,000ft altitude

I created a campaign for stable branch, then adjusted it for MP on public testing. The file extension changed by having MP added to the end. Apparently, the campaign for stable branch still gets overridden by the PT one, even with the different file extension. Has any one else experienced this, or knows how to remedy it?

That would be how I'd expect it to work. You'd need to make a copy of the campaign and work on that copy, if you want a version of how it was before you changed stuff
Got it thanks

I am on public testing and making a multiplayer mission. Also could it be the I start the drone too close to the path?
Also I have changed the speeds to 200kn initial and 275kn default
i am running on stable, so it might be that. you could increase the distance from the path or maybe the overlapping path might be the issue. you could also try making it a slightly elliptical path

Do we still need to be on public testing to do multiplayer custom missions?
afaik you do
dang

did you try sending path via event?
No it seemed unnecessary since it was set as default behavior but I will
Is there any way to change a multiplayer spawn point based on the completion of an objective? I kinda wanna try to make a push gamemode

no
I have also had issues relying on default behavior and have taken to just keeping it default none,parked and using an "init" immediate timer event that fires all the pathing/movement. You can't set default formation anyway so I end up having to do the init event regardless.

@ChadGatling  are you on PTB or main build ? I cant repro, my drone is following my path
I'm doing it on a MP mission. Which requires PT
oh I missed that, let me retry on my MP playground

might sound stupid, but maybe try  to check game file integrity in steam?
I verified game files and some need fixing but it still refuses to follow a path
Dang, I dont know then :/

can you send me your mission file?
I can check locally
Its uploaded if thats what you mean

ok , what the name?
Team Carrier ops Training
What kind of path is expect from the tanker ? so I know if it work or not on my side?

What kind of path is expect from the tanker ? so I know if it work or not on my side?
Should be following a heading of 033 for 20 miles
Then loop

did you try adding a 3rd point to your path?
i knew of some different game code that didnt work with 2 point path
Why would they have a 500m orbit?

Why would they have a 500m orbit?
ill try a third point
Yes but why? they are set to path

Yes but why? they are set to path
not sure,  but this is super weird behavior
Uploading now with more points

Did you make their default behavior to follow the path?
IIRC there is some issue with default behavior, most people found that making a timed event that fires immediately with stuff like setting paths works better
Ok so the 2 points path was the issues, having more point fixed it. Good to know.

so how do i define players spawning on a carrier?
if i have a carrier and the mission set for a specific plane, can they just spawn on it whenever?
If it’s anything like single player, you do it on the carrier unit’s settings

if i have a carrier and the mission set for a specific plane, can they just spawn on it whenever?
If it’s anything like single player, you do it on the carrier unit’s settings
There’ll be a tab at the top to assign planes to spots

Right but I can only spawn one player spawn despite being in the beta branch, I thought beta lets you make multiplayer compatible missions?
you have to make a special multiplayer campaign i believe
Eh. Sadly there is almost no interesting scenarios for long flights like in DCS... So I'll try to make one xd

any way to make enemy air units spawn at airfields and actually use them to take off?
can place them there manually but it does not seem to treat it any different as spawning in air
you need to order them to take off

if i add helicopters to a multi-role mission, does that prevent people without the dlc from playing even if they select a plane?
no
awesome

Is it me or does the IsLanded conditional not work properly?
It works for me. You have to slow down under 50 knots I believe and be within the radius of the specified waypoint
And be landed 😛

Maybe it's broken for the MP editor?
Maybe its the negation of it? I use it to test for players having taken off. I use Player Is Not Landed
I believe players start a little in the air, so it’s possibly triggering immediately

That was one of the issues I was having in the past

Do individual player objectives work for MP? Or you just have to have the same objectives that everyone sees? Or like individual takeoff objectives?
… is there a Takeoff objective type?
Regardless, I believe all objectives are team-based

… is there a Takeoff objective type?
Regardless, I believe all objectives are team-based
I mostly work with conditionals so By takeoff objective I just mean one that I make that is a takeoff objective and not a specific type of objective for take off. It was just an example

Oh we can't compare 2 global values to each other?
Huh. No, I don’t believe so
damn

You can just port over to MP?
yup
copy your mission into your mp campaign, before loading the game, edit the .vts to make sure Multiplayer = True and IsConfigurable = True. Then in editor remove the Player spawn and add your MP spawn. Voila

I am moving a MP over to SP. I named my campaign the same name as the mission. What do I need to copy over?
I just compared it to the missions
Superb new feature in the new version

is mp mission creating in the public testing yet?
yes
do ai wingmen work?

Do event sequences run in order and the exit condition must pass before the next Entry condition will be checked?
Yes
Or at least “I can come up with a way to read that that is true”

Anyone want to help me test my spawn trigger? You just have to spawn
I hate to ask such a newbie question, but I've had a bunch of tries at it, and cant seem to get the passenger pickup/drop off working. I have units boarding the VTOL but its not taking off and dropping off at the destination waypoint. Just the basic pick up and drop off. TIA.
Every Tuesday steam has a maintenance

Did you gave them a rally waypoint ? and you selected the unit that need to be dropped off? on the drop off objective
If I do a conditional triggered by a player in a MP mission is that just the host?
I can't figure out how to detect when a unit has taken of in MP

nvm

Do triggers only fire once?
correct
what you could do

Do I have to reload the game?
yes mission editor data stay loaded in memory
Another great fix : Mad4 radar / launcher can now be deployed , undeployed, for maximum randomness SAM site

Does it work by enabling then checking and disabling?
I think it is checked each frame, if global value = x continue
As long it is enabled

Do your global value start at 0?
yes
Its a trigger that trigger on conditionnal?

Its a trigger that trigger on conditionnal?
@Hoizen  yes I did non required objective that I enable to let player know how much life they have (using MP death). But if we can manipulate team score a bit further I would also use that.
So I could just have the objective activate on conditionnal.

Hey how do I make a mission end when an airbase changes teams?
Airbases change teams when you tell them to, so end the mission at the same time, I guess
yes its checking for global variably equals 0

Does it Need to follow a Take Off with an Altitude to actually complete the action?
They’ll firm up in the order you placed them
First one down/assigned the the group will be lead

How do I put the player in an air group btw?
With NPCs
The same way you put npcs in a group

@Skumby any idea why it wouldn't show?
Multiplayer?
Yeah

fr? so no AI wingmen
Guess not
that sucks

Off the wall, has anyone had issues in MP where an event is shown differently between players? I have a rocket arty salvo hitting an area, i see the rounds go where they are supposed to, however, my friend sees them engaging us and hitting us (but i do not) The hits do register too (damage me and him)
hm I use Arty on shot waypoint but I never saw has a client perspective, so I dont know

Appreciate it. Made some changes and still seems to be an issue. As host, the arty does attack the players, but the other players see it attacking them and me (both get damaged) definitely strange. More messin around with it hopefully

Maybe baha wants a new aircraft for team B rather than reskinned team A's one?
Tho would be nice in general to put any unit on either team
MAD-4's for everyone!

does earning money during the mission from completing objectives not work when launching from the editor kind of like the base budget doesn't? i was trying to balance my mission out and wasn't seeing the rewards
Good question, is there a way to see available money in mission?
when you land and rearm

Good question, is there a way to see available money in mission?
when you land and rearm
I'm not even sure you get paid for completing objectives during the mission. It might only be applied to the campaign cap after you're done

.yes if you set the reward on kill right?
I'm not seeing it added when I land and rearm
ahhhhh

does the mission editor open outside of VR? I don't think I'd last long trying to make a whole mission in VR..
It’s not in vr
opens on my pc?

Another newbie question. Whats the trick to being able to REPAIR when landing at a refuel/repair pad? I land, it allows me to reload, refuel, but not repair. Oddly.
(And I learned the chopper is capable of limping home with 1 blade broken in half, and Another clipped off at tip! was shocked!
Repairing can be disabled by the scenario author, so it might be that

Where is that in the editor?
I didnt see a switch to allow / dsallow
Bottom right of the scenario options, iirc

Another question as I prepare my first campaign. When uploading to Steam, does it take Only the items used in the mission/Campaign, or, does it upload Everything in the work folder? Unused sounds etc?
It only uploads the stuff that the mission uses
Wicked, thats what I thought, just didnt want to upload a ton of junk. Thanks.

Is the wiki correct that carriers top out at 15 m/s?
seems about right
close to slow vehicle at 10 M/s

Is there anyway to make it so the allied cruiser uses its forward vertical launched missiles to target specific threats such as an infantry on the ground? Or is it possible to make it so it attacks specific air targets which are landed..?
You may be able to assign it as a Priority target?
Unit, then (pick the unit), then- Action - Assign Priority Target - Pick the target

Doesn't it fire a radar guided missile? I don't think it can track a ground target. The allied cruiser has a cannon on the bow though, might try using that. Not sure what kind of range it has

I don't think I can do this, but is there any way to create an event that will add fuel to the players vehicle?  Or is the only way the player can refuel is to go through the comms menu in their MFD?
To clarify, this is for the AH-94, not in air refueling.

I just tested out the mp mission editor in public_testing, published to steam workshop, etc...  If go back to the main branch for my game install I assume I just need to make sure I don't try to open up any of my mp/public_testing stuff in the old (stable) version of the game right?  There aren't any other gotchas that I need to worry about when switching back and forth are there?
Not sure what'd happen. You'd likely be fine even opening them, as long as you don't save. It'd possibly crash, but that wouldn't corrupt your content
If I host a MP game in the public_testing branch and I choose my custom MP mission from the steam workshop, will others that try to join my game automatically download the custom mission?  I want to do some beta testing with friends today and want to make sure I give them the right instructions/expectations.

Cool Thanks @Strikeeaglechase

Paolo, is there a Media Kit to be DL somewhere? I need the BD PNG logo for the briefing screens and cant find one on either website or off google (other than the 320 rez version) - got a link for that somewhere I'm missing?
what like this?
Ya, thats the lil one

How would I set a friendly air group to loiter until the player forms up on them? I have a part of my mission where the player is to escort a SEAD team to an enemy airbase, but I'm not sure how to prevent the SEAD team from moving toward the objective until the player is actually in the air. I currently have the player air group and SEAD air group separated.
Order them to circle a waypoint where you want them to wait
and when the player enters a radius nearby, they go to their next objective/form up on the player/whatnot

Is that something I would add through the event tab? I tried to add a sequenced event where they orbit until the flight group meets up with them, but they would always fly straight to the objective. Although, it could be that my radius is too large.
did you set up the conditions properly?
mind sending a screenshot?

did you set up the conditions properly?

I'm not sure haha. I'm very new to the editor.

Is the first picture the entry or exit conditional?
Let me double check real quick
It’s the exit condition

Ok cool, thanks! And in the unit configuration tab for the SEAD group, should I set default behavior to orbit to prevent them from going to the path right off the bat?
Then set an event group for following the path after the exit condition is met?
one moment

Then set an event group for following the path after the exit condition is met?

spawn them as TakeOff

Can you spawn a unit or group at a specific waypoint with an event? Or is the only option random with the alt spawns?
You could just have a lot of duplicates of those craft at all the possible spawn points
Yeah I thought about that but assumed it would be resource intensive. Also, a pain in the ass

On that same topic, what about an unspawned ship containing a player spawn point. Or a ship containing a spawn point getting destroyed. What happens? Will the slot selection in the briefing room appear/ disappear to reflect availability?
maybe? That's a good question
I recommend you test it, and update us too please

Do events that trigger radio message actions work in the public_testing MP stuff yet?  I tried to set one up and it wasn't working.  Just wondering if I need to do something special to get those to work, or just wait.
it works
Hmmm I got no audio in my MP mission with this.  And I've succsssfully done radio messages in other non MP missions I have worked on.

@BahamutoD just so i know i'm not going crazy, are radio messages supported yet for MP missions in public_testing?  I've tried both play message and play team message actions and I'm just not getting any of them to play
@Steakfest  add a 7 sec delay before playing your audio
the event start immediatly even tho you might not be yet in the world yet (after you press enter)

I've tried every possible combination I can think of.  Timed Events, Sequence Events, Objectives, I can not for the life of me get an audio file to play over the radio in this MP mission.  @L etranger can you confirm that you have successfully gotten a radio message to play in the public testing branch on a multiplayer enabled mission?  In these screenshots,  I have an event sequence "Intro Sequence" that is triggered by an initial timed event.  I know the timed event is working, because the objective gets started as expected.  I even tried to play the audio as events from the objective start and that wouldn't play either.
I do have audio working properly.
if you preview your file it does play in editor; correct?

if you preview your file it does play in editor; correct?
your scripting looks good
Yep, plays just fine, and I don't have problems with audio on the main branch of the editor with my single player stuff.  Only seem to be having trouble here on public_testing with multiplayer

did you converted your mission into mp?
I ran into an issue where a ressource audio was missing from my .vts file, and it was making any radio to fail to play.
one ogg missing from the mission ressources would make none of them play

@Steakfest  nor host or client can hear the radio; correct?
I was only testing on the host.
did you try with a different ogg file?

how do you mark a mission as multiplayer?
is it on the workshop or in the editor

how do you mark a mission as multiplayer?
is it on the workshop or in the editor
you first have to be on public testing and then select a campaign and you should see the tick box

is it only for campaigns?
sadly yes
The "campaign" is really just a folder you lump all the missions you want into. So players selecting missions when they make a lobby dont have to scroll through a long list.

Was your radio volume in the cockpit turned up?
Yes. Volume was maxed out for all dials.
@Baconism  I have a technique where if you’re firing at a line of targets you can fire a dozen rockets, then slew the laser across the line right before impact to hit all of the targets

would you mind sharing your mission folder? I could test on my end
Anyone know how many hits of each munition type it takes to sink carriers and cruisers (both teams)?  And does hitting a component such as radar or cwis count against the ship?
I think 4 /5 agm65?  but that a good question for the wiki

Sea groups seem to always make an arrowhead formation. Is there any determinate way to know which position each ship will take in the formation? It doesn't seem to correlate to the order units are added to the group.
check actions in events there might be a formation for ships
Actually, it might be ordering them from right to left. Have to run it a few times to see.

@L etranger FYI, I tried other ogg files that have worked just fine, and still no audio.  I also added some tutorial text to the same events so I could be certain my events were all firing and i'm seeing the tutorial text, but something is preventing these radio messages from playing...    Did you happen to attempt to load the mission and see if you heard anything?
To try to debug this audio issue i'm having, I have a question...  When I download from the steam workshop a campaign that I created and uploaded, where does the downloaded version of the campaign go?  I assume those files end up in a different spot than the ones I'm editing with the editor.  So where can I go to see the files after they've made the round trip up and down from steam so I can see if there is something missing, (like an ogg file)
Found this I think...   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\...........

So, even found the downloaded steam workshop files and all the audio files are there, they just won't play in the mission...

I think radio volume on the cockpit knob also impact mission comm?
All volumes knobs are all the way up…. Hearing all multiplayer comms.

dunno man this is weird

When I started up the game I expected to have to create a new pilot, since the save data was gone, etc, (along with the other settings)  but I did not have to do that.  (must use steam cloud to recover that stuff?)  Anyway, when I started my mission from the steam workshop, it worked as expected...
Saves are in app data/roaming
Glad to hear man

Or the game ogg reader got busted? If that can be a thing?
except i would think that would have gotten fixed by previous reinstall/verify ops I had done...
so now my install is very clean, none of my custom maps, scenarios, campaigns are in those folders, as expected but I can move those back in from my backup.   But what's weird is the "SaveData" folder that had those gameSettings, inputbinding, etc...   are no longer there.  maybe there is a difference with public testing where those are now in appdata but they weren't before?  Because I haven't tried installing the older version.  Maybe @BahamutoD moved SaveData from the "install dir" to the "AppDir/Roaming" in this public_testing branch, and maybe something I did caused some jank between them and somehow broke audio.  I can think of one thing I might have done to my pilots.cfg file by hand, and that would have been to swap the order of the pilots, because my primary pilot wasn't the firset one in the list anymore and I was getting tired of constantly clicking through the list to get to it during my testing.   I don't know for sure if I made that change right before testing the audio in my mission or not though, so certainly not a smoking gun, but definitely a lead.  And I don't know where I made that change either, because I never saw that file in two different places until just now so I couldn't tell you where I first found it.

going to now switch to main branch, test, and then switch back to see if it all still works.
then carefully put my custom content back into the directories so I can go into the editor.

how does capturing work? destroying all enemies in an area?
Correct
If Im in the TADS using the targeting sight what is that - RADAR - TGP - TSD or ARAD? I want to flip a event when the player targets something, but not sure which is which here. TIA

is TSD the targeting sight display on screen in the cockpit? The TADS display? That would be my optimal choice.
TGP is the only thing that would make sense. I wonder if ground radar = radar for that purpose

For anyone who cares, sea groups do actually form up based on the order units are added to the group.  Examples:  If you have a sea group of 5 units, `A B C D E`  They will form up like so: ``` |   |   | A |   |   | |   | B |   | C |   | | D |   |   |   | E |```  This group of 5, `C B D A E`  Will make this formation: ``` |   |   | C |   |   | |   | B |   | D |   | | A |   |   |   | E |```

I've set the player to spawn on a cruiser, cold start, but their landing gear is up? Watup wit dat
┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)
😔

Did you place the player on the cruiser, or did you assign the player to the cruiser?
I placed it just over it
lol, that explains it

Ohh thanks, it wont lock on a dead unit will it? I've mastered flying, not the targeting yet hahah
(RedElite, thanks, I wasnt sure which it was in the selection menu)
Pretty sure you can’t lock dead targets

If I have a Campaign and a single Scenario under that Campaign, If I wanted to create a clone of the Scenario in the same Campaign I would think I would do the following:  * Duplicate the directory * change the directory name to something different * Change the name of the .vts file to match the new directory name * Change the Scenarioid in the .vts file to match * Open in Editor  I did all that and got this dialog, so what step might I be missing?
Maybe I need to change campaignOrderIdx too?
I think that was it, Not getting the dialog anymore

What does Detection Mode =  Force Undected do?    Does it stop units from getting the red and blue indicators around them when they're seen?

What does Detection Mode =  Force Undected do?    Does it stop units from getting the red and blue indicators around them when they're seen?
It prevents the craft from being able to be seen by enemies
so if the enemy is a human player, it doesn't really have an effect?

so if the enemy is a human player, it doesn't really have an effect?
force undetected is for example hidding an Allied AI unit from showing on the map
for search and rescure or surprise mf scenario

If a unit diverts from a path, is it because it's engaging something?
Certainly a possibility
They’re also not a fan of flying into the ground

Rail paths or regular paths?
Ground units will always follow paths
reg paths

Does Rail Path circumvent the group behavior? And if so, do path events work if they're set to that behavior? This would save me sooooo much time
Nothing circumvents group behaviour
Not even waypoint events?

Is there a trick to getting Ground units to follow a path? I have paths laid out, both on the surface level and a foot above(Just in case the surface was a factor in them not working), I have Soldiers, set to Path, or Railpath, or Follow, and then set to the selected path, and nada. Set it as an action in an event, nothing, its odd. I can get them to move to waypoints, but not just walk a patrol path. Happy Friday, thanks for all the help this week, almost got things to 100%
using an event is the "correct" way
or rather, the way that should work

Is it in a group?
Yes
it is, in a large group that Isnt on the path

How is the Leader designated?
that fits to the Follow function Im sure
first spawned in the group.

is there a way to play custom missions using multiplayer?
oh ok
are you on public testing

I don't suppose there is any way to do a comparison in the conditional editor to a global value, or some other variable is there?  I want to do some conditional logic that doesn't compare itself to just a constant value if possible...
I don't see how that compares team a kills to a global value.
It only triggers if both the kill count and the variable are equal

Can you only use visual scripting?
For the mission editor? Yeah
Is there any plans to change that

For the mission editor? Yeah
Is there any plans to change that
No public ones

wdym? Its all visual based
what interprets the blocks
The underlying logic is written in C#

so if typescript bad, then C# bad?
Typescript isn't javascript
take a step back and write it in C

does brainfuck count as high level?
no
I have no experience with brainfuck, but if it exists and is well documented...

so about as good as whitespace?
yep
you only need an 2 incrementors, RAM and a comparison engine

wait you can write mission scripting in notepad??
You can edit the .VTS files to Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V parts that would be too repetitive to do in the editor
^

then you'd just directly edit the VTS no?
If I was doing it manually yeah
no

Looking at events and actions, is there a way to end the mission?  Or do I need to complete an objective that's marked as final to do that?
You need to complete all objective that are marked mandatory for completion
if none are present, the moment the scenario is loaded, it counts as won (not sure how it's handled in MP)

maybe the host skipped the mission without you knowing?
or everyone just pressed respawn
That too

How come some older missions on workshop complete at a seemingly arbitrary objective?
*shrug*
There may be other ways to complete a mission, but that's the way I know

Tropical? Where do you find this? I just checked in PT too and only found Boreal, Desert and Arctic. Am I missing someting?
Decompiling revealed it, hand editing the map file used it
Sick! let me test it.

The scenario editor for MP shows the same tooltip for "score/kill" and "score/death" that it shows for "Budget".  Does that mean that the points earned for kills / deaths is added to the budget, or is that just a copy/paste bug?   I want to use kills/deaths to come up with a scoring system for a multiplayer map, but not if it just ads to the budget that each team has.  (I don't want to limit rearming costs)
I suspect it’s a copy/paste bug
Yeah it is

And followup question.  if I wanted to award 20 points for a kill and subtract 10 points for a death, do i have to put in -10?  or is it already implied that the deaths are a negative.
Thanks @Skumby and @Strikeeaglechase
Thanks again!

If someone drops from the game, I assume their score is retained, so using score vs. kills makes for a better winning condition if you're worried about someone losing 1/2 their team late in the game to dropped connections, or just having to leave in general?
Thanks for the Pathing Info yesterday guys, got it all working last night.
Everyone here has been super cool and super helpful, just straight up answers, and its let me keep building and tightening up my campaign. Still trying to figure out the "TADS Target on the ground to flip a switch, but almost there. The node for the LockTarget can be left at None...so Ill try to get that to cause a positive, perhaps just Using the TGP is enough, or, I was thinking perhaps if its targeted and then the "Using Weapon" tag might be enough to lock it and flip it? If so, whats the "short hand" for a Hellfire? AGM-114?

Here's a question thats on my mind. What is the green Ring that locks onto a target called? When you actual pull the trigger to "Lock ON" with a missile? but have not let the missile loose yet...when you get the tone to fire...what is that called? Id like a trigger when That happens, not when the targeting reticlue first snaps to it on the TADS display. Does that have a different name? Is that function the TSD? Hope everyones having a great weekend, Thank you for the info on how to run the complete mission Including the briefing, was my first time after a few weeks learning and work, really cool to see it all as one piece.
I don’t believe that’s an option either
Huh! Dang! Interesting tho. Thanks, there are a few selections in that drop down, I know RADAR and TGD, the other 2 I dont know yet

IF I wanted to re-use a map, for a new Mission, within a Campaign, do I need to re-save the map or something other than just deleting all the actions and such and Save As with the new missions name?
Map or scenario?
Ummm Scenario, I want to re-use the map, with the towns and roads Ive made. Thats where I am a lil comfused. Last night then I loaded thru the Custom Scenarios, I was all of them, versions and such, all under the map I made, I expect that will be a no no when uploading it, and hence I thought to ask

When I am in the Mission editor, the name in the upper right is the Map in use?
Yes, and I made that in the map editor
The scenario has all the units and events and objectives

can I do that and have it be used as the next mission base?
Sure. Use Save As.
Ok killer

@L etranger did the single scenario have the exact same id/name/foldername as the one within the campaign?
just the same foldername as the one in the campaign
I restored the single scenario from the bin to double check, and yes the radio is gone

stupid question: hows a fella make a multiplayer mission. do i need a mod? ive made single missions before but i don't see how to make it multiplayer
You have to be in the public testing branch right now. Make a campaign and check the multiplayer box
got it, is there a way to let players select which airframe they want to fly? as opposed to just forcing everyone into one airframe per mission?

Using public testing branch v1.3.6p2 using multiplayer lobby, any time I ask my wingmen to form up, the KC-49 and E-4 Overlord decide to form up as well.  The larger planes seem to lack the property of "set player commands" within triggers and in their own settings in the mission editor, unless I'm missing something i can change elsewhere?
They're not really meant to be used as wingmen. Nor do I think wingmen are even supported in multiplayer atm
wait your telling me I can fly in formation wih the E4 and KC-49 :risitas:

Make sure in the vets file it's not set to a campaign

What's the condition to finish that objective? It might be getting completed immediately, or not have an objective, or be completed before it's even triggered
The mission ends when the player completes the last active objective. I suspect you’re starting an objective in the On Complete actions of a previous objective.  There’s going to be the briefest of moments between the two when there’s no active objective, so the mission completes
Use the PreReq start type to chain objectives like that

And the follow behaviour whats that?

or triggers must start it?

or triggers must start it?
All refuelling are blind and deaf
Yeah, triggers

Is there a way to complete an objective where the condition is no enemy unit alive in a certain radius?
Unitlist > not any near waypoint
oh nice thanks

ok, something i'm confused about.  Does the game have any collision detection between players in multiplayer?  obvioiusly we've seen no collisions in our free-flight and air show missions.  But is that something that can be changed?  Or does the multiplayer engine just not support that yet?
trying to test a multiplayer map. says tat it cant because theres no player spawn, i have 8 player spawn points, any advice?
only in SP afaik

Need MP spawn; not player. Make sure the .vts is multiplayer =true, Also you can't test MP mission in editor, only from steamworkshop

Will every body get the Message Displayed or is this the way to display the message locally?  I would like that if a new player, who could not read the briefing, gets a small info, as soon as he turns on the battery. The question is whether everyone gets the message or only the one who just flipped the battery switch.
everybody will get it
sad

Is there a feature request channel? I think the ability to read the briefing as someone who joins late is a feature that benefits a large percentage of players.
public  testing or vtorldev
yeah this would be very useful for custom missions when people start joining new ones in the middle of a match

There’s no button to request to control briefing when the mission is in progress?
Sounds like it’s useful
Once the mission starts the screen switches to the scoreboard and wont go back

Do some units have more of a performance hit? E.g radars have more complex logic load  Mostly wondering cos I've played a few missions with not great performance but in my own messing around I can place quite a lot of units without issue  Is it certain units? Other game logic/scripting etc? Or is it to do with projectiles in the air etc

Did you compare to 0 vehicles?
Or was it just frame rate of planes /frame rate of tanks?
fps diff, same ratio with 200 tanks vs 200 planes

Was the tank frame rate different when you doubled them?

How do you convert a singleplayer mission to MP and add it to a campaign?
multiplayer = True in the vts file
then copy your mission into your campaign

how do I do the second bit?
just find your campaign folder here
that's what I was looking for, I overlooked the campaign folder

stupid question, how do you start a AH-94 multiplayer mission?
click multiplayer, host a game, choose a mission that has the AH-94 in it
i meant when creating a mission. like making my own

how would one do that?
in steam, right click VTOL VR, click properties
click the Betas tab

Okay cool! now to play it with friends do they need to be in the testbranch aswell?
yes
cool

Now how do i convert the mission to multiplayer?
I believe there's multiplayer spawn points you set
i've yet to get around to making a MP mission myself yet, so I'm afraid that's about as far as I can help you, lol beyond what I've seen discussed in the channel already

how do I move actions in nodes?
I need to move an action to the top
@Ethans there is a gray box that you can grab onto to drag things, but I think there are some contexts where the order you place things can't be changed, or maybe doesn't matter.

Was it ever addressed if MP missions actually support multi-vehicle missions, like the Air Show missions currently do?
like 2 AH-94s, some F/A-26s and F-45s?
throw in an AV-42C for the fun of it

like 2 AH-94s, some F/A-26s and F-45s?
throw in an AV-42C for the fun of it
yea this is possible, you can put any vehicle you want as a MP spawn, it even lets you select the amount of slots per AH-94 if you just don't want a gunner

Is there a way to preset a list of gps points or nav points so they are populated in the gps on mission start? I'm wanting the player to be able to select any point on the list at any time to be able to activate navigation to it. I know I could do it with a bunch of generic objectives and waypoints but that will get confusing with regular objectives.
Yup. You can send gps points in an action. Think it’s in the system category
I created a PlayBGM event on the editor screen when I was creating a multi-mission. I selected a song and clicked on the speaker symbol to test, but the background music does not play. Is this test function broken now?

mp3 or ogg?
tbh it was always kind broken, restart the game and try again

@L etranger @Freedomplaza  I saved the game, restarted it, and tried both mp3 and ogg, but the test play button for background music doesn't seem to work... Is there any other way I can try?
double check your audio is set right
it may have switched to your vr headset

does anyone know how to add a smoke grenade effect in the mission editor?
I also can't get an AI tank to follow a path. I set it to path, follow and railpath (and honestly have no clue what the difference between them, the wiki has no information about these settings). I have the default path set to the path I made and it still refuses to move
Is it part of a group?

Is it part of a group?
Well there aren’t any smoke grenades but you can always use a flare using action
I feel incredibly stupid, lol. I searched this channel to see if I could find the issue and I was pretty sure I never assigned the tank a group, and I guess I did

Is there a way to giv e the player an ability to trigger a trigger from the comms page?
LIke, where I create a custom comms group like "support" and have a command in comms for them to call in arty or whatever
Well you could use the “mfd-bottom-1” as a condition

Is the "reward" a monetary reward that gets added to their budget for buying future weapons?
I believe it's only at the end of the mission, or at least that's how it works in single player
Thanks!

Like, pull the map from GTA San Andreas, and import it into VTOL VR?
yes someone can, and that someone should be you
the map editor is free to be used by all

I might be missunderstanding something im reading, but it looks like they should be able to kill bunkers?
I thought so, too.
Bunkers have a minimum damage of 150, tanks deal 151 damage

Where are you getting those numbers?
yeah should be able to then
"naughty methods"

okay so how many hps does a bunker have?
150
150

unless min damage is subtracted?
Well, I let some tanks have a go at it for a while and they didn't make any progress.
what's the min damage for the allied bunker?

what's the min damage for the allied bunker?
no?
iv heard recent reports that bunkers might be a bit buggy with when they take damage

Wanna report that chase, or should I?
you can
500lb will

is this table of damage values and stuff posted anywhere?
None exists rn
I'd be a big help for map making to know what kind of performance to expect from what units

is it possible to launch a mission from the editor without headset and with a dev camera? I just wanna see if far away units are doing what I think
you can have dev camera, im not sure if you need a headset for it tho
how do you use dev camera?

how do you use dev camera?
press insert on your keyboard
then use brackets

does it include modded weapons?
temperz I bet literally every weapon in nbda can kill bunkers because boris told you to give it a lot of damage
aim280 cannot

ummm wat? Hydras can't kill bunkers. That's why I didn't list them
oh
your list is confusing

anyone know the ranges on the radars? wiki says 55k range on the S/A but im pretty sure i was being picked up at around 65k over open water
hmm.. anyone know if i could take screenshots inside mission editor without all those overlays, like it would be in-game.. ?
could just crop em in MS paint

hmm.. anyone know if i could take screenshots inside mission editor without all those overlays, like it would be in-game.. ?
could just crop em in MS paint
i mean, the cursor, the 'ghost' buildings and names etc

What aircraft are you flying?
Oh god imagine if the enemy military was willing to destroy buildings in order to win
Level the city with you in it

If you want to be scrubby, you can launch a 145 from 45nm away if you climb to 55k ft and exceed mach? I forget the speed, but quite fast
Cruise missiles would 100% be my solution to the MAD-4 on an oil platform problem. XD
On flat ground you'd have a very tough time. Your only chance would be to get the missile to climb up then get under and notch it once it pitbulls

So if you topple the platform the units on top will float there and still be active?
*Can* you actually topple an oil platform in VTOL VR?
Yes

*Can* you actually topple an oil platform in VTOL VR?
Yes
Hit any 2 legs with an agm or bomb

My rockets just arent launching, what am I doing wrong? I have a proxy trigger thats going off, the rockets are standing up, I have a list of Added Priority targets, but, no launching. theres a Radar selected thats active and has Engage enemies selected as well. Very odd, Ive tried a few ways to Sunday on it, and have to return to ask. TIA.
if its rocket artillery, you have to give a fire order on a waypoint, and it wont need a radar if its a SAM site, please stop calling them rockets, its confusing
MAD-4

I am stumped. I created a mission in the public testing for multiplayer. I did a small play test with some friends. I hosted it, we all joined like normal. We started it, it would go solid for 1 min. Then whoever hosted (we rotated after it happened the first time) would crash. Full crash, game would end, doesn’t even end with a bit responding. I have no idea what’s happening, anyone have any idea? (It’s a standard 16 player mission)
I would recommend sending your player.log
To get your player.log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows Key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: %appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log". 4. Upload this file into #public_testing, or whatever channel you are asked to do so in.

Im sure this has been asked, is there a way to make multiple aircraft available to be chosen in the editor?
Yes
the MP editor allows you to do that

Do airbases come with free refuel/rearm spots?  Or do I have to place all of the spots individually?
And for pathing, do units always go to the first path node? Can I put the AI anywhere along a loop and they will follow it?
Airbases come with refuel/rearm points in all the hangars and the landing pads

And for pathing, do units always go to the first path node? Can I put the AI anywhere along a loop and they will follow it?

The AI will start following the path at the closest point to where they spawn

i started making a mission on a workshop map, is it possible to convert it to MP? I can't load it after moving it i guess because I don't have unencrypted map files
okay I think I just needed to copy the map folder up a level
If a player is detected, are they always detected? Or can a player go back to undetected if they manage to evade sensors for sometime? can you hide from the AI i guess lol

If a player is detected, are they always detected? Or can a player go back to undetected if they manage to evade sensors for sometime? can you hide from the AI i guess lol
In the past, the answer was “yes”, but it’s become more nuanced with the rise of multiplayer and respawning
we can ignore respawns for the moment  I was making a mission where the objective is to capture multiple airbases, I've been forgiving with radar placement so that there is ways to the fields avoiding detection. I've got planes that launch when the player is detected and within in range, but I suppose after knocking the first field, the plane takeoff event will always fire I did try have a look see if I could do detected by [unit] but couldn't see it

Can you do repeatable missions?   I am thinking of an RTS style system where you have trucks go to a "resource location" and back to the base, providing some money each trip
s t o n k s
the answer is no, yukari from touhou project

CFTs push it up to what like 13k?
CFTs do refuel as its counted as "internal"
I want to say 20 000L

6400 + 4200 + 4200 + 4200 right?
wait no
I dunno

why is the AGM 89 more expensive than the AGM 161?
@ baha game breaking bug here
does the entire team have a budget in vtol?

does the entire team have a budget in vtol?
no lol
i want 4 a side competitive refueling

so whos making it? I will if no one will in 4 days exactly
how many refuel planes do we allow tho? one per team?
yes

how many refuel planes do we allow tho? one per team?
yes
161 technically has a TFR so its more advanced than a regular AGM but still not as complex as the 89

also do we do bedwars rules?
i will play this mission with you when its complete
wat

whats the min altitude for the tanker?
With what weapons
Lmao

@ierdna100 is the ASF carrier functional now?
can enemy player rearm on it
VTOL RTS also sounds great but I need to find a way to implement it  Resource obtaining workers  Ability to buy new units, like a mission with a -15000 reward that spawns a ground unit

any changes to be made?
1 u s d
no, perfect

Is hit by an AGM 89 a condition?
it could be
it is not

you can tell SAMs not to engage missiles right?
only in Unity
ah

can you sell starting fuel?
huh
I thought we could stop that

cant we just spawn them with very low fuel?
I assumed we could, never had a reason to
We could

Is there a respawn delay we could use?
noe
Make it more efficient by far to just fly to the tanker

Can you sell fuel in ext tanks?
only in CFTs
I think

how tf are you even going to die?
no more spawns
I guess running out of fuel but thats on you

(Much of discussion went into a group chat)  In any case, how can I give both sides equal carriers?
It seems allied and enemy have different carriers
Would be nice to be able to set a fuel consumption rate for a mission. Fuel is a useless mechanic since it never runs low in the course of a normal mission.

what about F/A-26B Naval Strike?
I'm not sure if I have done that one off the top of my head. I have done all the included missions tho
baha comms > tanker > call tanker to current position

Query of the day gents. If I had a Convoy of trucks, as a Objective, is there a way to take the waypoint location of the entire group? So, if one was killed, the way point would just shift to another in the group? Thanks as always.
just guessing, but you MIGHT be able to set a bunch of triggered events? start the waypoint on the first. if he's killed, set waypoint to 2nd one. dunno if it'll work if the 2nd one is killed, THEN the 1sts.
Not that I know of

Can someone make a Ghost of Kyiv campaign?  I would make it but I don’t know how.
Too soon imo
Feels a bit disrespectful

you want to fly on this map?
lol wow the actual twin towers
fuck no

just gonna say how sick would it be to have a "ghost of kyiv" mission? first ace in the 21st century if the story is real.
first ace in a day since ww2
It's a bit early for that kind of stuff

is it wrong for wanting to get handed the vr stick to a drone in this conflict? sounds like some good irl fun without the conequence of dying.
seriously tho, imagine if a country produed so many drones that it could afford to just let random untraind citiens that have basic simulator experience, fly them from their home computers
talk about chaos

The fuck is wrong with you?
lmao sorry but id love to vr control an armed drone for ukraine rn
Russian, Ukrainian or whatever, these are real people with real lives

ok may i reinterperate drones as UAV's?
That's the same thing
"Global Hawk is a high-altitude, long-endurance, unmanned aerial reconnaissance system.” High-resolution sensors, including visible and infrared electro-optical systems and synthetic aperture radar, will conduct surveillance over an area of 40,000nm² to an altitude of 65,000ft"

soyou think when im talking ARMED DRONES that it isnt a combat aircraft?
An armed drone could be a DJI Mini 2 with a firework launcher attached to it
and if its armed i assume you dont give a fuck about rules

you realie iwe wouldnt be shootinging at people, just UAVs, right? lol
Maybe that’s what you are saying now, that’s not what you said
Maybe get to know some of the peoples who lives have been permanently destroyed or ruined due to the things they’ve witnessed or experienced and you’ll be a little more stable

Is there any way to set the event radius to be a plane or 0alt? I would like an event to trigger when the player lands to pick up some homies
use conditional trigger with 'player has landed' AND 'player inside x metres of waypoint' does that work, or i'm missing something
that works, thanks

Does the action "Destroy" remove a unit instantly or just set-it-on-fire destroy it?
the second one
Awesome, that's what I need

Is it possibly to develop missions using 2 different computers? I e working on on pc then picking up on a laptop when I’m away from the pc?
Yup. You'll need to work out some way to transfer the mission folder across
Possible? Sure. Giant pain in the ass? Yes.

Possible? Sure. Giant pain in the ass? Yes.
Thanks for the replies. I could end up damaging/corrupting  the mission files one way or the other that’s the risk I suppose.
Just create a copy or back up and put it in another folder.

Is the campaign file bigger than 100mb?
hey guys, I'm getting the issue of where the player spawns in with the gear up at the air base. Doesn't matter if its set to cold start or flight ready. anyone know how to fix this?
are you 100% sure they are on the ground?

I was almost certain

what do events do? compared to objectives
They can both cause Actions to happen. Events don’t have entries in the OBJ mfd page, and have varied triggering criteria. Never really thought about it this way tbh, but they’re pretty similar
Events are used to make stuff happen that’s not directly tied to an objective

I guess what I really want to know is, if I want to make aircraft spawn after I take off, can that be done with an objective?
Probably, but depending on the context, I’d possibly use a triggered event
alright

Can I just check (I'm an experienced mission editor prior to MP) to make a MP scenario, all I have to do is make it part of a multiplayer campaign and then in each scenario I need to create multiple "MP spawn" units for each side, nothing else unique to an MP scenario over a SP one, right?
The "player" object is largely useless now I assume; do I need to include it somewhere anyway or can I leave it out? And if I leave enemy MP spawn points out am I effectively creating a PvE (collaborative) mission or *must* I include them?
correct

except if you reference player in any conditional to replace it via multiple mp spawns you need for

Tell us about this function. How does ''AI SPAWNS'' function with respect to the player's spawn position? Also, is it possible to set a respawn position separate from the initial spawn position if, for example, the situation changes and the respawn position needs to be changed?
Huh, never seen that used for a player spawn before. Only with AI. I don't think player spawns can be changed mid-mission though, no. I haven't gone through all the options in the events though, so I might be wrong.
It is not possible to change the location of a spawnpoint mid-mission, but the alternate spawn feature allows you to assign a weight to multiple positions of the same spawn, so let's say you have 3 spawns in 3 locations over an airfield so the player never respawns at the same spot with the following settings:  ``` MP Spawn 1:   - Position 1, weight: 50   - Position 2, weight: 150   - Position 3, weight: 150 ```  The player is most likely to spawn at position 2 and 3, given the weight is the biggest (at 43% (150 / (150 + 150 + 50)) while he only has a chance of 14% to spawn at position 1

can you destroy  bridges?
No
I assume when you add the spawn points to a carrier that has alternative spawns, regardless of which it chooses, the spawns follow it?

I assume when you add the spawn points to a carrier that has alternative spawns, regardless of which it chooses, the spawns follow it?
I didn't test it yet, just curious if anyone has tried it
Quick question, if a trigger event fails a required objective, Will the mission fail completely?

Quick question, if a trigger event fails a required objective, Will the mission fail completely?
Yes.
I've seen missions that simulate it by placing things like storage tents or bunkers ON the bridge, or right at the legs. blow those up and you've blown up the bridge

if I fine tune a map, what will happen to the missions using that map? will it get updated?
Not unless you update them
There’s a Repack Map option in the mission editor menus

fine adjustments in some mountains wont crash the mission right?
Nope
mountains look very weird.. also some water edges are very squared

In the public testing branch: how do you create an AWACS for the red team?
I'm not seeing a way to spawn one in the editor.
You can do it by modifying the VTS file but im not sure if thats a good idea

that's what the dev did for the coop missions?
theres prob a reason its hidden in the editor
ok, thanks.

Does anyone know if i can make a mission today and later convert it to a multiplayer mission once we are able to make those? Or will i have to start all over again on release?
well you can make a mission and convert it into a multiplayer mission through the vts files.
Also we can already make multiplayer missions in public_test beta so you could just start off with a mp mission to begin with.

Is there an easier way to test mp missions than uploading, subscribing, leaving the editor, then hosting the game (possibly with a game reboot if the upload was an update)?
i dont think there is yet
make your mission in SP then when it works convert to MP

aight, so due to the need to upload to the workshop to test a mp mission, theres a lot of missions that are broken or WIP, anyone got a few reccomendations for co op MP missions?
if you want to test an mp mission sadly you have to upload it. but you can always unlist or private it.
How many pilots?

unrelated, anyone know how the "is detected" conditional works? im trying to have a bunch of fighters launch after the player is detected and i cant get them to work right
is it a problem with the condition or a problem with the launching? I tend to have trouble getting AI fighters to launch from the ground, so a lot of times I just spawn them right into the air if it's not right in front of the player
theyre launching from the ground and a carrier. i don't think its a problem with them launching but to trigger the event itself

its either launching them right at the very beiginning of the mission, or not at all

What methods are you using to detect the player? What's around that will see them?
i want it to literally just be any radar
do i need to specify which radars?

do i need to specify which radars?
shouldn't. are the radars on?
yup

shouldn't. are the radars on?
yup
hang on imma go fuck with it

Questions about AI fighters. ''PlayerCommands''. ・UnitGroupOnly ・ForceAllow ・ForceDisallow and ''DetectionMode'' settings, what actions are performed when they are set?
Player commands determines who responds to the player's wingman orders
DetectionMode determines who appears on the NAV map

ForceDetected is like the supply tents in the second (?) OpCobra mission
ForceDetected is the default for friendlies. ForceUndetected is the default for enemies
i swear to god i can never find that pilot

... I actually know what mission you're talking about (A/V-42 campaign) but who are you responding to?
oh i get it now
lost pilot

Is it possible to have an infinitely respawning group in the editor? Looking to make a range map for a couple of friends and would rather not restart the whole lobby every time we deplete the range.
sadly loops can't be used in the editor 😦
but you probably could copy and paste and group in the vts files and set them off using events.

did he set PLAYER spawns or MULTIPLAYER spawns?
they are different, lol
Is there a way to make ships in a sea group snap to their formation positions so they don't move on launch?

Is there a way to make ships in a sea group snap to their formation positions so they don't move on launch?
well you can always use actions to make them move to a path
They do move along a path, but because they don't spawn in perfect formation they have to move around a bit. It's not a functional problem, it just looks goofy

Well this raises the question: How do I exit a mission from the desktop?
you can press either the "del" or "end" key i forgot which one it was.

Is there any way to copy/paste whole groups of units?

Why do some missions in the workshop require you to download the map as a separate mod? While others just include the map just fine?
the map is always baked into the mission
i guess its to credit whoever made the map

Am I being dumb or it is what it is?
You *could* have them all spawn and destroy excess units, but that only adds kills and doesn't change the total required amount
Alternatively, you could make the objective conditional and make your own logic

I am unable to test my MP mission that im working on, when I hit launch it says that I need to place a spawn point, but i have multiple MP spawn points placed already. Any one have an idea why it wouldn't be working?
MP missions can only be tested by publishing them to the workshop, subscribing, and then playing them
In other words: "Doing it live"

Is there a way to move the MP spawn during the mission? For example, after capturing an airfield, you can use it as a spawn point.
Nope.
you either need to centrally locate your spawn, or actually do a whole new mission

might be a dumb question but ive spawned in some units and they auto spawn as allies, cant seem to find the option to switch teams?
disregard i'm a dingus
You have to choose enemy units to spawn. it's a different tab

I recently had a hard drive failure. Is there any way I can edit the maps/missions I uploaded to the workshop?
not that i know of, iirc .vts files are encrypted
Drat! thanks

Can spawn points for multiplayer missions be disabled or moved?
What happens to spawn points on a carrier if it is sunk?
you can use alt spawns

What happens to spawn points on a carrier if it is sunk?
you can use alt spawns

hmmm i wonder, if you set the weight for an alt spawn to 0, and the regular spawn on the carrier, then destroy or delete the carrier, does that force all spawns to the alt spawn which is normally weighted 0? interesting.
might be an interesting workaround for the non-movable spawn points
You can't set alt-spawns for carriers apprerntly

Another Q for you guys; I take it there's no way of persisting data from one scenario in a campaign to the next? I'd like to make a campaign where repercussions of failures earlier on in the campaign might not necessarily FAIL the scenario, but will result in differences later on. For example, persistent loss of units - say you lose a support ship early on, that won't be there defending your fleet later on in the campaign. Is there currently any way to do this, or is it on a roadmap? That actually bring me on to another thought - do BD keep a feature/wishlist/roadmap published anywhere so I can not re-raise stuff that's already on their radar 😄 ?
sadly you cant do that but you can use money rewards.
Might see if I can work that into it, maybe so you can't afford certain aircraft. I forgot to mention, I'm thinking Multiplayer here - I've not seen the same campaign options for multiplayer (PvE/co-op). Is there a list of unit/weapon prices anywhere or have I got to go work it out myself 😄 😉

Okay, I think I’m doing this the right way. I want AWACS to take off and follow a path after a certain objective is completed.  I have the path set up and I set up a conditional trigger event that unit group Charlie which is AWACS will take off after the objective is complete.  How do I set it to take off and follow the path.  The trigger will make them take off and I have them all individually set to follow the path. Is that all that needs to be done or am I missing something?
I hope this mission is good 😅 this takes a lot longer than I thought
There is an takeoff order and followpath order

@Strikeeaglechase yo you home yet?
Is there a way to move MP spawns during the course of a mission?
Like, if I have alternate spawns on a carrier and an airbase, will sinking the carrier or changing the airbase faction disable those spawns?

Oh, you can't have alt spawns with a carrier, lol.

i had a bug after i added alt spawn points... ive tried this: regular spawn cold at hangar, first alt spawn holding short of runway flight ready, and second alt spawn in flight AP... but 2 problems ocurred in my tests.. 1. always spawn at regular spawn. 2. it spawns with gears retracted (cold but like if it was on flight)

How do I make a mission for multiplayer training?  Do I just make a normal mission with multiple player spawns?
Oh I see, it's an option for campaign only
Just make a campaign with 1 mission. :P

and how was that? did he beat it?
What is the unit type for red AWACS I would put into the VTS file?

Quick q: has anyone been able to get the friendly aircraft carrier to move in the pt mission editor?

Quick q: has anyone been able to get the friendly aircraft carrier to move in the pt mission editor?
if so how, I know i'm telling it to move right, since I do the exact same thing to make the carrier move in stable, but it sits put in public testing
i did same way

Any ideas why it has no effect?
Is the boat spawned at the start of the level?
you might have to call the event sequence via an objective

Also the "is not" "alive" trigger has always been very fucky for me. I don't use it anymore.  What i do instead is use the NumAlive trigger and set it for "less than" "1". Equals 0 is also sometimes not reliable.  You may have to use UnitList instead of Unit.

Wait what type of event is that?
sequence
says at the top

Do you mean I should set an objective "kill the boat", and it should trigger the SetEngage stat?
No
You should enable trigger on start for the event sequence

Oh fuck, that's what that "start immediately" checkbox does?
It starts it as the mission loads
given you already have a condition on the first box

Alright, thanks! I don't get the checkbox tho - how would the sequence trigger if I don't have the box checked?
You'd have another event that starts this Sequence Event
it never runs anything in it until it receives an external signal to do it (system -> run event)

Have you set it to engage enemies?
Oh I didn't, but now it is - let's try that
Does the MAD4 radar just suck (or have a high min altitude?)  I literally flew over it before it got a lock on me, no terrain in the way

Does the MAD4 radar just suck (or have a high min altitude?)  I literally flew over it before it got a lock on me, no terrain in the way
It got a lock on me and then lost it a few seconds later
it has a minimum range

What is the expected range of the radar itself getting a lock on you?
depends on the aircraft you're in and what's your aspect to it. Your Radar Cross-Section (RCS) determines if the radar will get enough bounce back to detect you
Oh yeah I was flying nose-on in a clean 45

How do I 'join' conditions and logic nodes in the conditional editor? Apologies if I am missing something really obvious but tried every mouse button etc hovering over orange nodes and can't connect them.
like a sequence or like an IF, Else statment?
Sorry just sorted it by clicking on the arrow symbol - I'm trying to work out how to force the mission being failed if the player dies e.g. no respawns allowed. Think I can use conditional objective?

Just set a Failure condition in all of your required objectives

Team A Deaths equals 1

can you just do an event?
Thank you for the screen shot 👍 clicking the arrow seems to be hit and miss for me to join the nodes - no longer working...
You could, but there's already a failure condition option in all the objectives afaik

why make the extra event if you could just do it in the objectives? well I guess if you have a ton of objectives and don't want to set failure for them all
though you'll still have to set the event to fail each objective individually. less work than dealing with the visual scripting
Clicking on the arrow in any condition box in the conditional editor  to get the join line isn't working consistently for me  - is it a known  bug in public branch editor?

Don't think so, I didn't have any problems when I made my stupid AH-94 mission in the public beta
OK thanks - just quitted and restarted and it worked - I'll do that in future as a fix.

As you where speaking about no respawns allowed... How do I do limited respawns.. i didnt figure out how to count deathes.. is it in MP stats node?
I still don't Undestand the usage of sequences.. but probably using this would fix my issues of triggering the wrong events hehe
I haven't specifically looked into it, but the game itself tracks deaths, so you can just fail objectives once Team A has reached 5 deaths for instance. AAS uses a ticket system where you can actually gain more respawn tickets when you capture sectors, so I'm *guessing* that the target number for failure is actually a global variable, and successful sector captures adds 5 to that variable.

U know anything about alt spawns?
Cuz im having some weird stuff happening
I use them sometimes

Set up 3 alt spawn with 100 weight, should be equal chances for all of them right? 1 at ground cold 2 at ground flightready 3 airborne  But it always spawns at 1, cold, but no brakes, no gear, kind if it was in flight.
yeah weight isn't done using 100% the best example i can give is, if you are trying to make a 50/50 chance of spawn you would have to put them both at 100
is this player spawns?

If I put some vehicles into a group they will no longer follow a path and just sit there. Is this supposed to happen?
Are you commanding the individual vehicles to move or the group itself?
I believe if you group them together then you have to command the entire group

Are you commanding the individual vehicles to move or the group itself?

Ok, where do you tell the group to do something? I see the group window and it shows the units in the group

Ok, where do you tell the group to do something? I see the group window and it shows the units in the group
Units in a group will mindlessly do what the group leader does
Who is the group leader?

Who is the group leader?
If the group leader starts moving, they’ll form up on him, then follow in formation
It’s the first unit to be added to the group

what does the "follow" behaviour for units actually do?
Id guess its for making things like wingmen or other planes follow another unit or the player
It would be funny to set a sam to just follow the player all over the map. Just set it as invincible, itd be like the slow unrelenting monster in a horror movie

Limited my spawned f45's in mp to mk83 and guns - set a helipad (vtol start and finish) and attached refuel/rearm unit to each helipad. But it won't allow rearm/refuel - says it is unavailable. Can't you rearm in game once out of briefing room if you limit loadout? Any tips on how to limit loadout but still enable ground refuel of limited weapons appreciated
If you don't allow configuration, then I'm pretty sure rearm isn't allowed
Allow configuration, but each spawn point you can set the allowed weapons in the configuration

Thanks for the response - I'm limiting the loadout per spawn point as you suggest - can't find an option to allow configuration though - all I'm doing is picking mk83 and guns by checking boxes in mp  spawn unit options. Apologies if I am missing an obvious tick box somewhere?
Scenario Info
Edit -> Scenario Info

how can I convert a map to multiplayer? for PvP ?
If its a map then run the public testing version of vtol and start a new campaign - select your map and tick multiplayer option. If its a scenario not a map I think you convert /import but that has not gone well for me. If just your map then set up allies and enemy player mp spawn points using units. I'm still learning the editor so others might have better tips/advice.
OK that might work. I could not place the enemy player in the map editor and I am not finished putting strategic units in place but wanted to test the map with another player to get a feel for the size and scope of the battle field.

How can I create multiplayer missions ?
I found it !
:q_pepedriving:

Any idea in how to implement limited spawns?
ive been thinking for an hour and couldn't figure this
yeh i know, MP Status counts deaths.. but how do i use that..

just a trigger? if mp stats death > X ?
if(teamDeats > x) { fail mission }
why i thought this wouldn't work?  whole mission is base on this logic hahaha, why would it be different? man, i'm so dumb

*facepalm*
You were right - started from scratch and the refuel/rearm worked thank you 👍

Can't get infantry - single or group - to follow a path in mp  editor - do I need to in use way points for infantry units?  - just wanted them to patrol around a base in the desert - but setting them to path then selecting a path doesn't work. Clean start with mp mission in public test branch.
send a picture of the setup
Thank you - will do tomorrow just not on my pc now 👍 + how do you attach a picture!

Have two issues if anyone can help please.  1. Found in mp campaign editor  screen that if you just change the campaign description text and nothing else after pressing save and exiting it won't save the description text change. If anyone can check this is the case for them what # do I report it to the dev... Unless it's a known issue in public test branch editor?
2. Edit - Solved. If I use F12 in campaign editor screens I get a pop up bottom  right to say Vtol screen shot saved - but it doesnt appear in the screenshot folder in steam apps / vtol e.t.c.... I am using the desktop 2D version of the editor - is this a known issue or does anyone know how to fix please.
Pressing F12 directs Steam to take a screenshot

how *do* you make MP missions? Do you have to do it via the MP mod or is there something in the base game?
Be on the public test beta branch, create a multiplayer campaign. Create missions in that multiplayer campaign
I can't find a way to get the editor to save changes to the main campaign description and name - it will upload changes to steam workshop but then in the editor when I go back in its reverted to the original desc and name I put in when I first created the campaign - anyone else have that issue / know if it's a known bug?

Try making a timed event that starts 1 second late and assings the units to move along the path
I cant see anything wrong from here

Have you ever had any issues with saving changes to mp campaign description / and or name. Save goes green then greyed when clicked on and changes upload to steam wkshop but when I reload campaign the desc and title have reverted to the very first text I put in when setting up the campaign originally..... is this a known issue?
No
OK thank you - I'll try a new test  campaign and see if I get the same thing.

thank you! will my friends have to opt in to the public beta to be able to play the mission?
yup
dunno if im being mega dense here, do you opt into the public beta on steam? i've done that but it doesnt seem to have changed anything in the editor, i dont see any MP options

You right click on the vtol logo click on properties and go into betas and you should find a selection menu for all the different versions.

public unstable build testing? is that the one?
Yes
It should be the top one.

you cant just do scenarios then? has to be via the campaign menu?
It has to be in a campaign
The campaign can have just one mission, and the missions it contains don't have to be related at all

and im getting from some of the previous posts in here if you've started making a mission in SP it doesnt convert over very well to MP?
I'm not even sure if there's an in-game way to do it tbh. Hand editing the files is inherently sketchy
Also save your description somewhere and be prepared to change it every time you update the mission/campaign

Since loops aren't available yet, has anyone created a tool to automate cloning triggers?
uhh no but you could do it yourself
not directly, but you can edit the VTS file or convert it to JSON then edit it there

Has Baha confirmed if looping triggers will ever be added?
He hasn't said its planned
but also hasn't said itll never come so we cna have hope

See if what's possible? Looping? As far as I can tell a trigger will only ever resolve once.

Gah you've already done so much here. I've been putting off learning JS/TS and writing webapps for way too long. Might as well throw myself into it. You know of any good tutorials for an otherwise experienced programmer?
Uhhh not sure to be honest, I picked up JS as my first language so I don't know a lot about how to jump into it from an already experienced perspective
I could probably write a python version in a little bit

what are you trying to do?
chase jumping from the high language to the even higher language
Currently, custom missions do not support looping/repeatable triggers. Once a trigger fires once, it will never ever fire again. The workaround is to clone the trigger, making as many copies of it as could be reasonably fired during a single playthrough. I want to make a mod that adds a "Copies" counter to the conditional trigger UI so it saves that many copies of the trigger in the VTS file instead of just one.

what kind of trigger actions are you trying to loop?
The first one off the top of my head is to spawn hostile craft every time a player spawns.
units can only be spawned once though

I don't play with the mission editor a lot but maybe you could add an event to revive/repair a unit? That way you can reuse it without needing to mess with spawning more ones each time
Shoot down some targets, then hide them, repair them, and teleport them back to their starting location in a loop
No way to resurrect or repair destroyed units that I know

i'm pretty sure it's already been askep a lot but what the hell 🙂 : Do we have any insight on when it will be possible to implement comuniy missions/maps/campaings in multiplayer?
It already is on the public testing branch. It'll be pushed to the main branch when it's working well
oh cool so i just have to switch to public test on steam to have a look right?

I'm trying to create a multiplayer campaign. I changed to the Public Test branch, I verified the game files. I'm not seeing the Multiplayer checkbox you were talking about. Am I looking in the wrong place?
You're not on the public test branch
this one, right?

will "force undetected" work against AI?
i.e. if i set a friendly unit to "force undetected" enemies wont detect/engage
or do i need to add non-targets for the enemies

Is there a way to play an audio file specifically to one or more players in mp - eg two planes from a 6 plane flight wander into a proximity area and only they hear the audio track? Just thinking about mp user specific messages - so alpha 1-2 for instance flys into a proximity area on their own and rather than triggering a generic msg everyone hears only they hear 'you are in the vicinity of the enemy base e.t.c.' as that message would be confusing to the rest of the mp flight.
@besp09 I don't think there's one for a certain player for the jets but there is one for a specific team and if the player is in the helo.  I checked for the same thing awhile ago.
@besp09 Should be "Radio Message Team" and "Copilot Radio Message" in the Event Action Browser.

Is there a max amount of missions you can add to a campaign?
i don't think so but the max would probably be the amount of storage it takes up.
Ah okey! And what about max amount of objectives in a single mission? If there is one?

Ah okey! And what about max amount of objectives in a single mission? If there is one?
well i would doubt that as well
i find briefing images take up the most storage.

Also does baha blast make all the missions in the multiplayer?
like on the workshop?
No for the like pre made missions for the not public testing missions

Also has there been any chances for missions that a person has made to be added to the game? Like a competition or something?
That sounds fun tbh
Likie best overall missions might get added

Does Force Undetected mean that a unit can't be detected?
no, it just means it s not showing on navmap at the beginning , useful to hide ally on start, like missing para
Is there a way to swap units teams mid game I think it would be cool for AV's to drop troops to "capture an airfield" and then 1 team could land and resupply

Does anyone know if there is a unit cap or not?
Well you could test
I dont think there is a limit per se but your framerate will begin to suffer at some point. Where that point is is depends on your PC.

Hmm... I set an objective checked as start immediatly and use the 'start event' to send wpt to gps.. but gps shows nothing when in game... Was this supposed to happen?
Another question as you were talking about unit cap... not spawned units will affect fps?
not really

Another question as you were talking about unit cap... not spawned units will affect fps?
not really
there's like 3 servers

Did you set the waypoint in the event? I don't think it will send the objective's waypoint, you have to tell the event what waypoint you want (which can be the objective's, but you need to set it manually)
There's like 10 at peak times
Plus you could like get friends

Has this ever been answered? I also would like to know if you can reorder the events by dragging them around or something other than going into text file.
I suspect the answer is "no"
Props for using the search functionality, though

Is this a multiplayer mission or something?
Yes editor event > send to GPS doesnt work in mp AFAIK
can confirm did not work in mp

Even if you’re spawned and flying around?
yeah, but that was before the last update
What's the easiest way to make tanks patrol a city?

What's the easiest way to make tanks patrol a city?
Make a path through the city, tell the tanks to follow the path
Make sure to shove them all in the same group

The path has to follow the roads, right? Should I put the nodes in intersections?
it does not
The tanks can go up 90 degree slopes

Mod please pin this? @Shadowtail?
Turn off the equipment selection through the mission info and open insert cam.
this is already pinned somewhere

Also, is there a trick to spawn a group of units with alt-spawns together?
Like, if I want a full squad of tanks to spawn in 1 of 4 possible locations
If I just give them all alt spawns I assume they will be separated

I don't quite understand the reason for Entry *and* Exit conditions in Event Sequences. Shouldn't it just be a single "Continue" condition to advance to the next sequence node?
you have a delay at the begining of each node
after the delay the condition is check. So you for example exit condition, unit is dead, then wait 20 sec before going to next node.

What's the difference between adding an exit condition to Node 1, vs adding it as an entry condition to Node 2?
realization
Let say, you want to play a radio after the last tank is dead, then complete the objective once the radio is completed.

Maybe it's just because I'm looking at this from a programmer perspective? I already understand how to use a state machine intuitively.
Again, every entry condition can be substituted by adding empty node above with an exit condition
but its more click doing so :p

Hey this has probably already been asked but why are my bases are roads being erased when I load the map in missions editor?
Did you manually copy the map and rename the folder without renaming the .vtm file inside?
No I just saved it in game

Did you manually copy the map and rename the folder without renaming the .vtm file inside?
No I just saved it in game
I’ve tried twice and the bases keep getting deleted

Did you change the map after you originally created the mission?
No I’ve made new missions each time
odd

Specifically on one map or did you try more?
I’ll try another
Height and city changes are saved to the .png files, which have static names. Bases and roads are saved to the .vtm file, which has a dynamic name. This is why I think it's a problem with the .vtm file.

Do you have any antivirus software running?
No
This is a bit out of scope

I think I know how to make a specific tank or group of tanks patrol a city following a path, but what's the best way to have many units patrol separately? Can I have units start at different points within the path? Do I have to create a separate path for each separate patrol?
Units will start following a path at the point closest to them
Oh, that's perfect

just to make sure, not spawned units are accounted as 'not alive' in conditionals right?
Units are alive until they're killed
Unspawned units are thus alive

if more than 3 players AND those units destroyed? 😛
why i can't think without writing it here. i feel so dumb every time haha
talking out problems is the greatest way to solve them sometimes

omg youre about to show me something that will change my life?
WOW
it's a bit of a joke/meme, but at the same time there's a truth to it

that should cover both cases.. right?
oh, last node is wrong
imagine as num alive equal 0

Do I need to speak or read portuguese? XP
otherwise yeah I'm happy to help test
well.. mission briefing and objectives are in portuguese, as well as some audio hehe.. but u could just take down every enemies.. thats what is meant to be done in the missions haha

How do you change the missile type on the launcher?
When looking in the launcher's settings there is a tab for equips just like air units
It was hiding from me for the longest time

What's the maximum reasonable altitude to have an enemy AEW-50 AWACS orbit at?
> BSM-66 - "Standard radar-guided missile." The standard Surface-to-Air Missile. Attempts to intercept the target, dealing major damage on impact. >  > BSM-66LR - "Standard radar-guided missile. Equipped with [a] first-stage booster for extended range." A regular SAM missile with an extra booster stage, giving it much longer range and making it harder to outrun or outmaneuver. >  > FLKM-100 - "Dual stage long range radar-guided missile that deploys a field of explosive munitions." Essentially a BSM-66LR that functions as an aerial cluster bomb. Intercepts the target and deploys a small field of cluster bomblets in front of them. The spread-out damage makes it excellent for dealing with bandits in close formation. from the wiki
30k, 40 at the very most

I think you're off by exactly one order of magnitude there. I assume the original poster meant 32,800 ft?
meters are bigger than feet, so the number for meters should never be bigger than the number for feet
Ahh, the power of editing. Sneeky breeky

All the fixed wings are 40k right?
Heli is like 12 somthin
I think the 42 default is 30-35

What's to prevent the AH-94s from just lobbing AGM-145s over the mountain to LOAL? Or are you just restricting their weapons to prevent that?
I remember for a time there was a hard limit to the game at 40k ft
Was it not 10000m?

yeah, you could just ban them. feels like a cop-out though, y'know? A heavy-handed way of escaping poor mission design
Ehh, at least for the AH94 banning 145s is a great way to add a bit more challenge
True. 145s OP

Speaking of, anyone have a writeup of good mission design? (Or bad things to avoid?)
Most effective Sam on my first mission was a launcher tucked deep as you say with 3 radar on the crest... Great idea about triggering support radars
RWR just *lights up.* "Oh.... fuck."

....why couldn't I just spawn 30nm closer if literally nothing happens and there's no threat in the first 30nm?
same with making objectives really far apart, with nothing interesting or challenging in between for huge stretches
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2569449610

also, you can make checkpoints make quicksaves in missions right?
why does noone do that
you can also limit the number of quicksaves in a mission. I found that out the hard way

to prevent quicksave spamming? The RPG player trope of quicksave after every 10 steps, every item picked up, every enemy killed
tho quicksaves sorta buggy now anyways, so..... probably better to not rely on them
Maintain your weapons and they will rarely, if ever, jam.

so I can go past 196km?
Yes
O-O

is it a things where you just have to edit the file?
Yes
ah

do you happen to know how that effects performance?
It's bad if you add a lot of things to it, same as normal missions
the terrain itself doens't seem to lag the game the bigger it is, but he didn't go *too* big

To play devil's advocate, what would you think of a game like Euro Truck Simulator where the majority of the gameplay *is* realistically driving a truck across Europe for hours at a time?
also DCS: Exists
to add on, spawning in 10-20 miles away puts you directly into sam range when you take off

I am, yes, what about you?

i thought stupidMap was ketkev?
no no that was ketkev
That's relatively niche gaming though. While some people find it fun, most don't. We're talking about general principles here. Like ArmA is generally pretty realistic, but it's too much so for most people. Designing for simmers is different from designing for the general gaming population.

Like, a realistic mission would be jet transfer. Make a huge map. Take off from one corner. Fly straight line to the other corner. Land. Mission complete. Would some people find that fun? There's probably a few. The vast majority wouldn't.
Unless you are catering to a specific crowd, a lot of "realistic" bits can be trimmed off to make a mission more enjoyable for a greater number of people
Well you've kind of answered your own dilemma; the people who like that kind of mission will play that mission, and the ones who don't won't

Oh dang, this goes all the way back to that?
Yep.
Ahh, but what I was talking about was the inclusion of a 40nm flight to an objective for no reason. What would otherwise be, say, a straightforward strike mission that includes a massive long flight for no reason other than... "realism." Trim that flight out, it's unnecessary and makes the mission more tedious for most people

would it really be a mission then if the objectives are right outside of spawn?
sounds more like target practice idk
lol

And a lengthy flight could also be fine *if it has a purpose* like evading heavy air defense by requiring low terrain flying. Then the pilot is doing *something* right?
but there's also long missions like killbox or falklands where it takes a bit to get to objectives
both are really fun

Is there a way to view global values in mission?

Im looking for player controllable chopper... can I not have mixed playable vehicles in amission ?

multi
well im makinag it for multi, i just literally opened mission editor and added a carrier and fa-26b's to it.. and wanting to add the attack chopper also

ok i think i may have figured it, do i need to put player spawn poinst down instead of the actual aircraft? and by that means, will the mission only have 1 playable type of aircraft?
ok i really dont understand how this thing works
depends on objectives and enemy types, whether you want to start detected etc.  if you're bombing a location and the only threat is a short range/IR sams then a bit of a  waste of time  jets get away with it a bit, once you're up you travel a lot of distance quite fast, helo not so much  also annoying when a ah94 workshop mission insists on you climbing a 15000ft mountain

Can a unit be destroyed before being spawned?
good question
yes

You don’t need to futz around moving stuff
so i save it and it does not apper

You’re in the correct menu for the plane you set the mission to use?
in the mission editor i just placed a Player object
isnt it enough ?

so can it be done from files ?
not from in game ?
Can what be done?

not from in game ?
Can what be done?
change the player arcraft to b26

Probably, but I’ve no idea how. What’s stopping you doing it in game?
i open the vts file
im not a 3d person more of a programmer lol

how do i do it in game , thanks ?
The files aren't designed to be edited by hand, it's not really possible to make a scenario from just the text file
whel

why game version is 1.3.2 tho?
i play ofline
thats the game version that the mission was created in iirc

game is currently in 1.3.5 no? oh old version.
Where can i find the f16 Mod ?
its not publicly available

Oh 😢

Is there anyway to give artillery trucks a point to fire at?
in actions you can give a location to fire at i think
All I see is ripple rate and shots per salvo

Hey, is the multiplayer editor in the public testing build of the game? Trying to figure out how you'd add multiple player slots.
Oh I see
I have to start a campaign, it can't be a standalone mission.

Oh hey, it's Rimmy, lol. So you did read my youtube comment (maybe?). XD Looking forward to seeing what craziness y'all get up to
No longer true! You can launch a test from the editor now, but it will be a private game that no one can join (since it's not on the workshop yet)
OMG this is awesome

SAM Launcher doesn't need *any* line of sight on the target, right? Only the radar it's linked to.
correct
Would be cool to have transport vehicles like an LMTV in addition to all the other ground vehicles to be able to create  convoys or pose as support vehicles should there be a need for them in creating a mission.

This Russian convoy satellite images making you hungry?
Very much so lol
Hey guys, how do i convert a singleplayer campaign to MP?

Hey guys, how do i convert a singleplayer campaign to MP?
I think all you have to do is switch to the public testing branch, click edit your campaign then you should see a box to click that says 'MP Campaign' before you select a mission to edit. That will make it a multiplayer campaign, and then you just drop in 'MP spawn units'  in to your missions in that campaign.   From what i understand you cannot make multiplayer one off missions yet. They have to be housed in a multiplayer enabled campaign.
Cool, thanks! I'll try to do that.

With the developer camera up, pressing Tab allows me to shoot a machine gun with left click. Don't suppose anyone knows of a way to drop bombs from the developer camera?
no you cant
I havent even attempted to check this my self, but do AI wingmen work in MP?

I havent even attempted to check this my self, but do AI wingmen work in MP?
They can certainly exist and follow scripting, but I don't think they can be given orders.
And they can't be grouped with the players afaik because players can't be assigned to a flight group

@L etranger or anyone else, I'm preparing to release my first custom mission. It has many triggers and complicated mechanics. I've thoroughly tested it in SP to ensure it's stable, and I'm about to covert it to MP. Anything specific you recommend testing after converting a mission to MP?
make sure the players have enough time to fuck around before the missions starts, so everyone joins and takes-off, regroups and whatnot
So like, don't start triggering time based stuff too quick into the mission?

So like, don't start triggering time based stuff too quick into the mission?
Basically, yes
And time-based events in general, try to let the players go at their own pace, MP might take longer than normal missions because people are like that

What's the best way to delay a "mission start" radio message until everyone has spawned in?
I tried making it on a 5sec delay but by the time I spawn in it's already done
I usually use a 7sec delay rules

*unrelated question: do you work in the communications industry?*
Unrelated question, if the mission fails do all triggers just stop working?
Or events in general

Unrelated question, if the mission fails do all triggers just stop working?
Or events in general
You mean objectives?

no.. strange question, why ? 😄
7 seconds is usually the delay between a live broadcast and what the client receives
This is probably my fault because I don't really make missions but I accidentally made the mission fail and almost immediately all of my hidden groups spawned in

Possibly related to the potential race condition I've noticed? https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/957356092000722964
Put a 1sec delay between the spawn action the "go here" actions
@Sypwn  there isn't much you can do. MP should work out of the boxes. If you tested properly all condition in SP it should be good. Make sure tho if you reference player in condition to change the ref to mp_spawn_1 or mp_spawn_2 etc

Also unrelated question, what is a good way to tell if storage tents have been blown up? I went with a really wonky: ``` if(storagetent1.isNotAlive)                                 AND if(storagetent2.isNotAlive)          AND if(storagetent3.isNotAlive)                                AND if(storagetent4.isNotAlive)                 OR    failthemission          if(storagetent5.isNotAlive)                                 AND if(storagetent6.isNotAlive)          AND if(storagetent7.isNotAlive)                                AND if(storagetent8.isNotAlive) ```
Thanks. I kept the MP spawns in the entire time as AI units, and I'm swapping them back to MultiplayerSpawn in the vts
and I don't think it worked well

There's an option to just read from the list of storage tents?
:waa:
same to easily have a no enemy near a waypoint  (Secure area) unit list > not any near waypoint. for AAS, I just use a 15Km radius waypoint, select all units, unselect players, and just wait for not any near waypoint to valid the obj.

can I shadow moment you?
I found a junky solution to make a 1 life per slot dynamic mission.
I thought about it deeply one day and keep wondering, how would a script work in this case?  Let's say JSON to assign properties, or whatever, the current property menu is fine.  For triggers though?

more like an interface to use code action.

Any simple way to get a higher resolution picture of a map than the 512x512 preview image? The loading screen has the "VTeditor" in the middle and the minimap has gridlines.

Regarding multiplayer campaign editor. Is it a known issue that you can only spawn in the av-42c when attempting to launch the scenario from the editor or something?
How do you add multiple players to a mission in the mission editor?
Selected player aircraft as ah-94 for both player mp spawns launched scenario from mission editor In the slot and equipment selection scene I still showed ah-94 options, and even could select equipment for them there (though I just left the equipment what is had by default for me) spawned in in with a av-42c with no equipment ejected a couple times and still only got the av-42c went back to mission editor, and my MP spawn points had reverted to av-42c (maybe I forgot to save) after setting them to ah-94 again and saving everything worked as normal  Still odd that the slot selector showed ah-94 and it's equips the first time, despite spawning me in the av-42c

Does anyone know if there is a way for an AI AV - 42c to drop off troops? And if so how?

Does anyone know if there is a way for an AI AV - 42c to drop off troops? And if so how?
There is, yes. I've definitely done it in a mission, had an AV-42 that spawned with troops drop them off, and that completed an objective. It's one of the action events available
Thank you so much

Anyone got the list of dev controls for mission testing?
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor
Wait it has been deleted.

Hi , after creating a map and a mission that is not a training one  when i choose the aircraft i don't have any missiles to attach ; anyone knows why ?
You need to permit equips. If it's a singleplayer mission, that's done in the scenario options. If it's a multiplayer mission, it's done on the player spawner entity
how do i spawn players for coop scenario

is there a shortcut to make the hud invisible so i can take a screenshot?
btw, can ai fighter jets form up on the attack helicopter?
I couldn't find one so I just ended up using Windows Snipping Tool to get images from the editor.

Is there a way to duplicate missions in a campaign so I don't have to remake the entire mission for a pt2?
the is a "save as" option.
Ah ok

did you try and save and then it froze?
it has not froze
seems like a ui bug

wait has the file been corrupted?
no
okay good

is there a way to add subtitles in the mission editor yet?
You can sorta do it by using the tutorial message function
that will display text over the pilot's view

Any way to track how many saves a player makes within a mission? I know how to limit or turn off, just want to update a global value on save amounts for a sort of scoring system
hey, im pretty new to the editor and was wondering if there is a way to select multiple units at once? thanks!
Sadly. No.

ooof

Whats the bullseye in the scenario info?
its a reference point on the map people can make callouts in reference to
Okey thx

Is there a way to create a custom mission with the editor that is using the quickstart map? Can't seems to find it in the available maps ...
What's the quickstart map?
if you mean the freeflight 2 map, or the f45 freeflight maps, i dont think those are included with the game

hey guys, is there a way to respawn killed Units with a trigger?
a new trigger with a spawn action dosent semm to do the trick
Nope, gotta spawn whole different set of units, sadly.

Dosent that slow down the mission though?
might be easier to copy 'em by opening the .vts in notepad and just doing a copy-paste and then edit some names
I dunno why it's that way, it just is that way, lol

does it work with mp though?
Yup
oof

Has anyone been able to figure out how to get the ground units to spawn? I made the waypoints like the guide says and none of them spawn. Also enemy air planes just spawn immediately right on front of me and serve me like a Chick-fil-A drive thru
quick question
is this meters, kilometers or nautical miles?

is this meters, kilometers or nautical miles?
its fine, I'll wait until you maybe update it ^^. Its just such a nice addition to have endless waves, its as close to arma/dcs liberation as we can get so far so im excited to see your mod updated 🙂
Afaik meters

Am I right in thinking there is no way to revive destroyed units?
There is not.
Thanks

I can get an npc to taxi out to the runway with a path and then give him the takeoff command. But later, I can't get him to follow a taxi path after giving him the land command. He always follows his own route to the same hanger. Is it not possible after land command to prevent him from continuing his predefined taxi route?
Plane on ground can be finicky, I personnaly avoid any micro management at all. Execpt Take Off/Land, follow path in air.
Hello, I am trying to make a mission now that workshop multiplayer is public, but it is only letting me create one player spawnpoint

Also, what happens if I have more MP spawn points than seats in the briefing room?
bc of the new update, could anybody make like a multiplayer target practice map?
cause might be fun to do with my friend

Timed events. I've set a timed event not to start immediatly. then i have a triger event to 'begin' the timed event. Timed event never initiate. Why? haha
Have to see how you set it up to be able to tell you
No way we can know without seeing it

can you open the mission editor/vtol without opening/plugging in your vr headset?
yes
how would you go about it? I know you can launch your game but dont you get stuck waiting to press ready while in the carrier atc?

Try it and see?
no there's "mission editor" and "map editor" buttons in the bottom right once you get to that scene

is it possible to play radio messages for only one team to hear in multiplayer missions?
nop
phooey

can someone send me good missions with the ah 94 heli?
like send files
of the missions

Does anyone know where VTOL VR stores workshop scenarios? It's not under customscenarios, nor does it seem to be in %appdata%

So, when placing a drone carrier, is there any way to edit the on-board manta's weapon loadout?
Nope
They just spawn with the double machineguns

Did the debug camera change to remove the gun option or am I just not finding the right guide?
ok i see
I hear a rumour it's not available when doing multiplayer testing

how do you add spawnpoints to carriers?
click on the carrier, and click the button label "edit spawns" or something
i dont remember the exact name

hey i'm struggling to get the helicopter to work, it always only has a pilot slot. Anyone know how to fix this?
what should I press here to enable the second seat to work?
"allowed slots" to 2

what should I press here to enable the second seat to work?

oh wow

can you place infantry on enemy carriers?
They won’t move with it
So it’ll just sail off, leaving them floating

Even if the carrier is parked?
if the carrier is parked
and nothing moves

how good is the manta ucav in combat?
i have a drone carrier and i don't want to overwhelm the players
They are not that great

what is a reasonable amount of aircraft to throw at the players?
6 per player running a2a would be reasonable/easy
Naval strike has something akin to 30

what dose reload time mean on sam launchers?
like after it fires one missile or all 4
all 4

do ships attack each other at close ranges?
if they have an antiship VLS
carriers dont

Can you disable the orange team if you just want PVE?
Rocket boats will *crush* ships lol
Yup, just don't put any spawns in.

how do I fail a mission if a unit is destroyed or players go to a certain area?
is the win decided if a team completes all its objectives?
😭

is the win decided if a team completes all its objectives?

If you set an objective as required and that objective is failed, the mission will fail

can someone send me good missions with the ah 94 heli?
files of the mission
You can't get them off the workshop?

You can't get them off the workshop?
I think they want the unencrypted mission editor files
yea do you have any?

yea do you have any?
or do you know where i can get some
Now I'm kinda curious why you want them

how do you make a naval fleet move to a waypoint in formation?
if someone can send me some i would be grateful
so please

so no one has any missions?
Just download them from the steam workshop it's really easy
Will that work also if you give a path to the first unit in a group?

putting an enemy aircraft on "force detected" means the allied radar will be forced to detect the aircraft no matter any stealth implementations correct?
Nope
then what does it do

so if i put force undetected it will never ever show up on the navigation but it will on the radar?
Again, no 😛
.O.

Have you played the built-in campaigns?
bearly
There’s a mission in the AV-42 one where you have to find a lost allied pilot

did you make that mission?
yes
fuck you

did you do it alone?
no there was other people
i made it to be up for hours

to refuel off the apache?
to refuel the ah-94
oh

what, the rotor disk tilt?
so you fly up
also, that 105 PIO

do *"Team A"* and *"Team B"* refer to the Allied and Enemy teams respectively?
Yes
If you put a helicopter MPspawn point down in a multiplayer campaign mission, does that prevent players who don't have the DLC from playing in that mission? Even if you have other non dlc aircraft MPspawns available to fly in that mission?

nice!

Quick question. Apologies if this has been covered although I couldn't see it? I have created an AH-94 Multiplayer campaign by converting an existing single player campaign. Is there anything I need to do in relation to settings within the editor to accommodate other players aircraft being able to spawn in or for two people to occupy one aircraft? I am quite experienced with the single player version of the mission editor but have not used the multiplayer functionality at all so i'm looking for some advice?
I have no idea for the Helo. The player spawn aircraft are just in the units for mp campaign editors
Probably adds two seats in the menu if you select an AH-94

how do you add players to team b?
unrelated, capture the AWACS
you get like, 3 awacs's's's's's's per team

Can anyone advise the most effective way to set up no respawns in a mp game please for x1 helo set to 2 seats. @Thenlar i think you must have done this for your island AH94 mission? Thanks.
The Enemy Team gets so many cool sea troops while team A gets an assault carrier Aircraft Carrier and Cruiser i wonder why
I set a failure condition on every single objective. "If Team A Deaths = 1"

Can someone explain to me how to convert a single player mission into a multiplayer one? I think I did it, but I dont know
It has it listed as a separate mission in the workshop
need to be a campaign first

like, edit in the mission editor or in notepad?
in mission editor for the spawn
I do all my mission in SP coz I can skip the helmet, disable configuration screen; play in accelerated and kill any unit (without using my headset). When the flow is good I convet and add the mp spawn

Would it still show up separately on the workshop from the SP version?
Yes it will be a campaign
Got it

Which flavour of Sam site?
How do I command the enemy artillery to shoot a specific target such as an allied tank or a refueling base?
nvm i figured it out

ah
that may be it

I'm needing some help with a scenario I made, in the mission editor I have about 7 enemies that are coming towards our air base but when I try to host the scenario all the enemies are gone and the mission says complete, what's going on?
do you have any logic errors like events.
also what are your objectives

is there any way we could jump into a call and you could help explain this to me?
Are the enemies spawning and pathing in a sensible way? Are they spawning underground, or at Mach 1 at ground level?
they are in the air about 5000 feet going around 350kts and speed up and travel to about 30k feet

Are the enemies spawning and pathing in a sensible way? Are they spawning underground, or at Mach 1 at ground level?
they are in the air about 5000 feet going around 350kts and speed up and travel to about 30k feet
are they set to spawn instantly?

are they set to spawn instantly?
they spawn when I do a trial run in the mission editor but when I host the scenario they don't spawn
You’re absolutely 100% sure they don’t exist when you start the scenario?

If I want a trigger from a vehicle control would being switched on be a value of 1 and off a value of 0?
Post mortem: Confusion about what the events meant caused all the enemy units to be murdered as soon as the mission started
@Throttle just had a little think, and I believe your second objective is still wrong, but not in a way that’ll stop you killing the enemy

Is there any way to get C-RAMS to engage rockets? I find them just sitting around and not doing the thing they were literally designed to do pretty goofy
They should do that automatically. They're just not very good at it
Not doing the C-RAM justice

But they can kinda hit bombs? Eh
Honestly the player would be pressed even make it over to where the c-rams are in operation without failing the mission (if the rocket trucks are allowed to fire for more than 60 seconds it's basically too much civilian infrastructure destroyed)
I've had it shoot down 3 mavericks and myself

So you're saying the literally won't even try to shoot at rocket artillery? No funny tracers?
no, they can only shoot at aircraft or missile actors
its not possible to shoot an artillery shell, im not sure if rockets have hitboxes

You can manually keep the radar on those off right?
Yeah could work
On the plus side this would leave some burning wreckage sitting around like something got hit and damaged by rockets

unless you want the ciws to be the burning wreckage?
No, I was thinking the manta
I thought they were only fully destroyed if they took enough damage or crashed from a sufficient altitude

Is there a way to turn a friendly into an enemy - change teams? Using trigger to engage enemies currently but wanted them to be 'blue' until a proximity breach (eg helo flys too close) then they turn into enemy... Didn't think killing the blue then spawning the same in red on top would work - fire/bodies left on map e.t.c.
No
Thanks

Is there any documentation or tutorial on using the mission editor? I’d like to learn more about it, but don’t have time to go in and fiddle around with it. Reading or watching something while on break at work would be better for me
There's the wiki
Ok I’ll check it out

Yo, how to add multiple players?
Create a multiplayer campaign, create a scenario in that multiplayer campaign. Create MP Spawn entities in that scenario
Ah, ok, thanks man.

For refueling. Is it necessary to set a KC-49 (for instance) with a relatively straight path, or having it orbit a way-point enough? I don't know if the refueling plane will be flying straight when/if it detect a plane is coming in for refueling ...
It can refuel in a turn, so making it orbit is fine
it's just *slightly* more difficult to refuel on a constantly turning tanker.

but you can understand how to modify the game files themselves?
:squint:
"the mission" there are a lot of missions

Why do you need/want those files?
i said that i dont know how to explain in english
Could always try google translate, but the files are just binary data im not sure how that would help you

just do you have any?
Yeah here one second
lol tried google translate its jsut giving bullshit

*what if it was hexadecimal data?*
:Think:
Nah it’s octal data

would you have the logs?
I don’t do any more
Perhaps they did respawn

Can someone explain the situation with force detected /undetected and red enemy marker display distance please. Got a mp mission in Ah94's I am working on  - proximity event  triggers x2 manpads spawning on separate roof tops - close to where a helo needs to land on a roof top in a city - the helos are limited to fcr and cannon of choice. Is the red unit marker appearance distance related e.g. If you are within x metres it dissapeard? - would force detected effect distance it shows. Helos will be within 200 metres of these sniper manpads when they spawn - is there a way to bracket them in red that close to help helo location (I know i could move them/turn them into infantry to make it easier...) just wanted to know how the red marker brackets actually work. Also I have tried to set a bunker before now to force undetected to stop it being found easily but the Ah94 still pings it with the enemy orange brackets from 100's of metres away. Is there a way to stop this?
Force detecte doesn't affect the < > around units
Force Undetected doesn't affect the ability to detect units on radar

Thank you for that explanation 👍 do you know if there are distance rules on the red brackets appearing/dissapearing in view? And if so how far away would I have to place an enemy so when it spawns it will get bracketed? - and Im assuming the visor in thd Ah94 (or Jets) doesn't effect red brackets showing or not? I'm assuming their visibility is just a distance thing.
There surely are, but I've no idea what they are
It's not pure distance

A few questions:   1. Can you develop a single mission then import it later into a campaign or do you have to develop the mission as a campaign set from the beginning?  2. Can a unit/units have a randomized spawn point (possible locations picked in the editor) and can units have a percent chance of spawning?  3. Can you have randomized secondary objectives and what may be some logic things to consider to prevent bugs?
1) Single player, yes. Multiplayer, no.
2) Yes, yes.

Is there a way to limit the starting fuel level for the player? I manually added "fuel = 50" to the player section (in its "UnitFields") like I saw it done for other units, but in the 'equip' screen in game it was still set to full. I'd like to enforce the player starting with less fuel, as to inforce the need to hit a tanker first.
Internally fuel is typically a percentage, not sure if it’s the same in the mission editor but I’m guessing you want .5 fuel
I assumed it was percent, since for example that field was set to 100 for a E-4.

i really need an AI respawner tool. Is there not a single way to respawn units after they died?
nah
the best you can do is copy the unit and spawn it again

When you're calling for a unit to trigger a waypoint in a multiplayer campaign mission, is 'Player' and 'MP_Spawn' the same in this instance?
yes
turns out this needs 3 conditions to be met for each alternate spawn :pain:

how do i add wingmen?
Set your player to alpha squad and place a wingman of your choice and set their squad to alpha
when i say form up on me they say they are busy

Hey, in the mission editor is the 'Move Spawn' trigger action bugged? Each time I trigger it in a mission I end up really bugged out with graphic glitches and I just see a blue sky as far as I can see.
help! Everytime my missions says mission completed at 0:00:00
but it only shows after i kill 1 enemy unit

Would anyone be interested in trying a different style of mission? I call it project unlimited. Enemys are scattered all over the map and enemy aircraft spawn every 20 minutes to intercept. It'd be a good air and ground mix
For the fa26

random encounters moment

Do the targets get marked? Or do you expect people to search for them? Note that currently it is impossible to respawn units. You are limited by the number of times you are willing to copy those units and triggers.
There's alot of enemies on the map so I didn't add any waypoints. If you can't find something to shoot there's something wrong
No real objective just fly and blow shit up as you get intercepted every 20 min. Some planes are fighters some are bombers and some are uavs

What's the objective? Kill everything, or just a certain number?
Oh
Personally I wouldn't be as interested in a mission with no final objective, but others might like it.

Does a mission end when all objectives that exist have been completed(either as a success or a failure)? Or do i need to set some sort of mission ending logic?
Once the last active objective is ended, the mission ends
Thanks!

Hi, I have a few questions i couldnt find here after searching:   1: I created a simple scenario in the current release build as a sort of firing range for me and a friend to practice AH ATG combat, I‘ve read to play it in MP you have to edit it in the test build to set up spawns etc.  How do I get there and can i „port“ my scenario to the testing version (and back if it can be played on in the release branch) and how do i set up different spawns for other vehicles? (Right now i have parked AI as placeholders)  2: As a fitting end to destroying all the practice Targets i set up a RTB objective that triggers if either the vehicle is damaged, low on fuel (is the entered number a percentage e.g 20.00 or do i have to enter 00.20 for 20%?) or all targets are destroyed, and to counter the RTB disappearing if there a mid mission refuel i set up a RTB2 that only triggers if all enemies are destroyed, would that work or will the game be confused if i were to complete both RTBs at once?  3: For AI ground units theres an option for something called move in radius. What is that Radius and can it be changed?  Thanks you all ^^
1) You can now create and play custom scenarios in multiplayer in the regular build, so no more need for public testing
It's possible to convert a single player scenario to a multiplayer one, but I'm not sure of the exact steps

Ok thanks a lot, so just start the current build and instead of mission editor go to campaign editor and then theres an option to go for mp ones?
Where you'd normally pick the aircraft, there's a tick box for multiplayer
(When creating a campaign)

does cancel objective not work when the objective is started then?
Interesting. Didn't know that was there
No idea what it does

how to make artillery/rocket artillery fire at target?
There's an event action for that
oh ok ty

is it possible to get player count the easy way?
I use cancel objective on non required objective for AAS
nvm, I half answered my own question for getting player count on a single team:

I would like to make a mission, but i dont have many good ideas, does anyone have some ideas for missions?
you don't need a good mission idea just a good way to execute it.
but its impossible to make a (good) mission without an idea

if you want to do a multiplayer operation, here's the brief for one i did with my server https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EgLHsw29X7MUXfX_X_vP6OPMqDk689Ms-vOW6FzuE0Y/edit?usp=sharing
its milsim so if thats not what you want it might not be super helpful
for me i just envision shit that may happen in like 15 years

Anyone know if there's a way to compare 2 global values?
I can think of a really horribly way
oh god

Have most of the recent bugs been ironed out? Sounds like it. I may jump back into the editor and fool around some more
I'll just do a big nor statement for now, since i t's not there anyway.
have you heard of lua

lol. You still work for Downpour btw?
Yeah I've worked there for a while
great

How? Most missions are not linear in the slightest
You can customize lua however you want, you can make it entirely event based if you want.
What is there now is a scripting language. A visual one. It's just very limited

Does it do run it more than once?
every second in fact :)
What?

You are aware events can only be run once yes?
Updates right before points are awarded to the team with air superiority
Every kill?

> You are aware events can only be run once yes?
If it's true more than once
It will only run once

what is the CPU cost of an event?
A certain amount
what happens if you call stop/start on an event after a certain time, will it go again?

what happens if you call stop/start on an event after a certain time, will it go again?
No
Only once can an event run

how does it check whether the event has been run? does it keep a list by their ID's? or is it a property
You also can't respawn a destroyed unit. And an unspawned unit is considered alive
good question, I recommend you look into that yourself in the massive fuck-off class that is the editor's and tell us about it too pls!

what does the property "RTB Waypoint is Spawn" do for player spawns in multiplayer?
use spawn pos as RTB waypoint
I uploaded a (training) campaign to Steam Workshop, but when I go to Steam Workshop in the game, it only shows maps ... ?

You’re in the wrong Steam Workshop bit
Back all the way out to where you select the aircraft on the main menu, and use the Steam Workshop there

how big should a helicopter map be?
At 200kts, it takes the heli about 16 minutes to fly 100km (54 nm). Depending on how much traveling you want the players to do in order to get to the objective, you can use that as a starting point.

It is not currently possible to make tunnels with the editor in the game, correct?
It is not possible to create tunnels
Use an Event Sequence. Add a node with a separate entry condition for each one of those groups. Then it will only be checking one group at a time, reducing the performance cost. Also, this makes it easier to debug as each sequence node advancement gets logged in player.log, so you can see which group didn't trigger.

Air to air helicopter refueling when?
It's not about the fuel/range it's about the flight time. :/
Change the spawn point of the helicopter at certain checkpoints so if they die they wouldnt have to go all the way back.

Is there a way to make landing on a carrier an objective? Seems that only waypoint can be used for "landing" type objective. But the ships are moving .... maybe with some custom rule thing?
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/960626322730807306
Thank you. I'll give it a try

what do you mean by "choose the carrier"?
oh, you can pick the carrier at the waypoint!
yeah that. XD

You've done a LOT of debugging, haven't you? There's a whole thread just for your mission alone. XD
It's the game's fault I swear!
For real, yeah it's a pain to debug. Giving everything unique names (units and event sequence nodes) and reading the player.log makes debugging triggers and kills much easier.

Anyone have some general advice on designing missions that include both the AH and other vehicles in satisfying ways? I feel like the fixed wing vehicles end up often overshadowing the helicopter's role due to how quickly they can get from spawn to objective to objective
The AH-94's major advantage is its gun, which can kill a LOT of ground targets
1) spawn it *closer* than the jets

hello everyone, is there a quick guide about how the spawning works with the new multiplayer?
Players spawn on the map spawns
Hi guys,  I'm busy making a mission for MP (not that this should matter), but I'm struggling to spawn one unit only out of a collection of units (so I don't know this unit's end spawn location when I start the mission so it's basically random). All respective units are set to not spawn immediately.  I'm trying to use the Sequence Event to accomplish this, but I think I might be understanding it incorrectly.  How I currently have it set up: - Each node has an entry condition of Chance 15% - Each node has an exit condition of a check for if a global value is 0 (I have a global value set up to default to 0) - If a node has its entry condition matched (Chance 15%), it will spawn the respective unit (I have a node per unit) and then it sets the global value to 1  Every time I boot the level up, none of the units spawn (I even have the last node's entry condition simply set to check if the global value is still 0 meaning no units have spawned so the last one HAS to).  I have also initially tried setting only the entry condition of each node to Chance 15% AND if the global value is 0 (last node only checked for the global value = 0), yet this still did not work either.  So my question is basically this: If a node's entry condition IS NOT MET, do the other nodes even fire off?

Sequential events MUST fire in sequence. That is, sequence 2 cannot fire if sequence 1 doesn't. If the 15% for sequence 1 fails, then the entire rest of the sequence hangs right there.
You'd probably be best off just using one unit and giving it a bunch of alternate spawn locations

I am a software dev so fortunately that logic is all good haha.  Still thanks a bunch.  Final question though, but how do we test launch MP campaigns that are simply saved to disk?  As mentioned above I need to publish my changes to the workshop before being able to launch it (as far as I know since I can't see my mission anywhere else other than the MP host screen)
from the mission editor there should be a way to launch
I wish players would leave more feedback on steam for mission builder to know what to fix, improve

Is there a way to prevent a wingman from doing a vertical takeoff on the attack carrier? I have setup a training mission starting on the carrier, but instead of taxing and doing a short takeoff, it just go for a vertical one from the spawning point ...
Problem is vote is for the whole workshop item, so a full campaign getting a weird vote because of a specific mission .
A link to the workshop page item could be interesting

Hello, I created a campaign with one mission. I tested today with some people and tried to remove bugs. If you wanna try it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2792930907
What aircraft is it for?
all of them, except the F45

What aircraft is it for?
all of them, except the F45
I forgot to say, it is multiplayer

How many people is it designed for? There's literally no information on the workshop page lol
5 or more
Good idea to include briefing notes on workshop page

Perhaps I need to set it up differently?
What would cause a wingman to not refuel at the tanker we're just behind when asked to do so? It definitely could have used some juice. Instead it keept flying off (to who knows where)
he probably has his refuel location set to somewhere that's not the air tanker.

it's RTB was set to "none", maybe it should be have been set to the tanker?

it's RTB was set to "none", maybe it should be have been set to the tanker?
yea thatll probably fix it
actually, the wingman unit doesn't have a refuel location. The one set is the scenario info

are you sure or telling it to refuel and not rtb?
You don't have to use the option "Final" to end the game. Just use the option "pre required" objective. And mark the objective box as "required"
 As long as all objectives are completed the game wil end.
But which ones? The objectives won’t all be activated, and so won’t all be completed

But which ones? The objectives won’t all be activated, and so won’t all be completed
Then disable the box "required"
And use the pre-required or triggered option but not "Final".
Ok, so I can set it as preq, but don’t tick any objectives? Also I thought the required option meant the objective needed to be completed to complete the mission, which is my intention. Is the required option just for triggering the start of the objective?

Is there something in the logic I could use to trigger the RTB objective?
I’m thinking I could set flags each time an objective is triggered, then on completion. Flag is set to zero and at the end of each objective manually trigger an event that looks to see if all the flags are zero

Can a conditional event be enabled multiple times and will it work properly?

Can a conditional event be enabled multiple times and will it work properly?
Example scenario 2 of the 3 possible objectives are triggered. At the end of each those objectives there’s a conditional trigger enabled on completion of each that if flags associated with those objectives are all 0 (untriggered objectives should also be 0), then start RTB
Yes,

It looks like there is no way to make the player invincible. Is that correct?
... I wonder if having "triggered event" that repair the player everytime its damaged would work ...
isn't there an "invincible" flag you can set?

isn't there an "invincible" flag you can set?
For AI units, yes. None that I can find for the player
I wish there was a way to set an ETA for a sea unit/group when they are moving to  a waypoint ...

when testing a mission, you can make the player invunerable no?
yes, but in this case I'd like it to be invincible outside of testing
There is currently no option for that.

or am i thinking to simple here?
My thought is RTB start is triggered when when all possible obj flags are 0. If obj triggered add 1, when completed  sub 1. Each possible obj will have an associated flag. My mission has a static primary goal with random obj starting after it, so the RTB trigger check would be enabled after when the random objs initialize
I’ll need to experiment though

That works? I’d assume the mission would end after the last active objective is completed, as the final objective hasn’t started yet
Final objective will automatically start if there is no other objective active
Oh yeah, you'll need a temporary objective that gets canceled when the real objectives are rolled

After a few playthroughs it seemed pretty bug free, so I went ahead and uploaded it.  Feel free to leave any feedback or bugs encountered https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2793506276
You can edit the title and description in the Steam Workshop so you're not limited by the in-game editor character limits. So you don't have to make a comment lol.  Mobile doesn't have tags. What vehicle is this for? If it's multiplayer, you should probably list that in the description.
@jas4500 I'm streaming working on DynLib right now if you're still interested.

It does reset everytime you publish an update, so keep the text saved somewhere for easy copy-paste.

Is there a way in the editor to designate Bullseye points?
First create a waypoint for it, then set it under Edit -> Scenario Info
why do so many people call their map "pvp/freeflight"

Is there a way to get troops to stay in radius but not stay in the same 10 foot area? I set staying radius as a behavior and set the way point and they just walk around this tiny little area
Maybe have them patrol a path?
Guess that'll have to do

Maybe have them patrol a path?
Guess that'll have to do
You can set multiple paths, and randomly have each infantry choose which one they patrol. if you feel like making all those scripts. or can open the VTS in notepad and just copy-paste them

Hey, is there a way to make my player VTOL spawn in full of infantry to deliver them to the drop-off?
Is there not a Passengers button on the player unit properties. Likely not in mp though
unless im blind

how do I make it happen?
Send it to an island somewhere for pickup?
How do you make what happen?

6 infantry men is max for the av correct?
8
Thank you

can it contain a manpad?
Yup
Hell, it can contain 8 manpads

Can someone explain the rewards system to me?
also , how do I know who's team A and who's team b?
Team A is formally known as allies

also , how do I know who's team A and who's team b?
Team A is formally known as allies
Team B is formally known as enemies

Is there no way to go back into map editor and make changes while working on the mission?
:sadge:
Yup

Where is the scenario editor located?
It's the mission editor
Found it

is there a way I can make an objective to both pilots to RTB to their own cruisers to complete the mission?
I think I found it
My paths are a bit separated from the cruisers, are they still going to follow them if assigned properly?

What's the action to fail the mission? (ex: oilrig destroyed)

What's the action to fail the mission? (ex: oilrig destroyed)
set a team B objective
It's a coop mission, no enemy players

so I just make a team b objective to destroy the rig?
yes
So you can do that with events?

So you can do that with events?
:KEKW_A:
no that is objectives

Isnt the ai going to start blasting the rig?
yes
That's not what we want

Can't I just make 5 actions failing all the objectives of team A if oilrig is destroyed?
would this work?
yeah?

This should still fail the mission though right?
I'll test it
I would assume so, but have no idea

wait do i have to be in ptb?
No, but you have to be creating a multiplayer scenario
oh

where can i do that?
To create a multiplayer scenario, create a multiplayer campaign, then create a scenario in it
ahhhhh

For proximity triggers, where do I set the proximity point?
does it create itself when I click "New trigger"
It's the Waypoint

Is it a bad idea to put manpads on an oil rig that can't be destroyed in order to complete a mission?
:PepeLaughing:
Feel like that's going to be almost impossible to complete without dying, there is like 0 cover cause it's in the middle of the ocean

What's the manpad targeting range?
Couple of km, but manpad missiles are extremely easy to dodge
And by dodge, I mean defeat using flares

If I voice-over the whole brief page, do you have a button to turn off the voice over in multiplayer if you want to read it yourself?
Negative
:bigsadge:

For a multiplayer mission, do you recommend just leaving it without a voice-over?
I guess it's personal preference
For briefing, since player will mostly talks, its better to not have notes voice.  Opposed to if you play singleplayer mission.

Is there a way to spawn infantery at the position of a moving vehicle (as a trigger)? I can spawn them on a trigger, but their position will be the original one (as set in the editor), not the position they should be at
Nope
ugh, thanks

yeah that's the problem ... Will they walk if I set a waypoint to them?
If you tell them to walk to the waypoint, yeah
You can do it immediately after spawning them

Anyone know what speed they are going to?
For a vehicle you can set the speed, but not for infantery units.
What does the "follow" mode do? I have seen that question posted a few times in this channel, but no one seems to know

What does the "follow" mode do? I have seen that question posted a few times in this channel, but no one seems to know
I'm gonna assume "Slow 10" is 10kph which sound like maybe it will be infantery speed
or is it 10m/s?

Looks like there's no way to get a UAVC to "protect" a moving unit, right?
i mean, you can make it fly in formation with an aircraft
but uhh, not a tank or anything

is it realistic to use an aircraft to escort a ground vehicle?
Orbitting a spot ?
I think having a UAVC orbiting a moving column not that un-realistic

the Manta? ... sorry forgot the acronym for it
you can have a big orbit radius and change the orbit point every 10 km
manta ucav yes

Will your mission will be that long?
Infantry are so slow that you can basically have the UCAV orbit a single waypoint and the infantry will never be out of range
yeah, that's a good idea

if the orbit point is "none", will it orbit the spawn point?
usually yes
Someone mentioned setting the orbit raduis ... but I haven't find a UI control in the editor to do so ...

difference between path and rail path?
no idea! lol
hopefully someone who's tested it knows

speaking of paths. I edited the VTS file to duplicate a path (and change the altitude of the points that compose it) and used for id the id of the last path + 1, but while the mission loads in the editor, that added path doesn't show up in the list. What give?
im sure they are just the same now.
as lots of people had problem with bridges with path so now its just sticks to the path set.

Did you put the friendly carrier speeds there too? They weren't last I checked
its been there for at least a year
i have all the healths of every unit also

Can anyone confirm if they've seen "Vehicle Control" events working in multiplayer?
Also has the non-targets list worked in MP
yes

Will a TEAM B manpad engage and shoot down an AI TEAM A aircraft?
Yes
Thanks

take off / wait is not landed / follow path?
Quick question for those that may know how to assist: Is there any easy way to determine if all players in a MP mission have landed near a waypoint?  If I use groupings and check if all players have landed, this does not work since not all MP spawn slots (that are also part of that group) have players. I also don't see anything in the lines of 'Active Player Units' or something like that so I take it the logical check for 'All Units in Group have landed' checks every unit assigned even if that unit has yet to have a player choose and spawn on it.  I have tried using the land objective, but I believe this completes if any player has landed in the defined radius. I want all active players to have to land
My mission has 2 mp spawns, a VTOL and an ah-94.  In the briefing room, the 2 available vehicles for spawn are both VTOL

why don't I get an option to spawn in an ah?
Make sure you've saved and uploaded the version where the ah spawn has been set to be ah
They were both set to VTOL, sorry

Is there any way I can switch Bravo 1-1 vehicle with Alpha 1-1 vehicle? I've set-up all the voice-overs for the mission for Alpha 1-1 to be the AH-94, but in the brief room the VTOL is Alpha 1-1
I'm guessing I'd have to switch the cruisers around and re-configure the spawns and the paths?
:AE_PepeStare:

I'm guessing I'd have to switch the cruisers around and re-configure the spawns and the paths?
:AE_PepeStare:
The callsigns are based on the unit group the aircraft are in

Where do I do that?
Here?
I dont think I set up unit groups, I just have team A and team B

Time (sec) = 5 means the message will play 5 sec after the game starts right?
After the event's triggered
5sec after that delayed trigger is enabled

Is there a way to create an objective dynamically? I'd like to setup a scenario where you have to fly to a hold-off position then (after a delay) get a message telling you to engage a specific target (with GPS coord provided at that moment).
No, but you can create a pile of objective/unit/GPS points, then pick one at random
Yeah, I suppose the objective could be "generic". Thanks @Skumby

is that possible to setup?
Looks like you're going to have to use a triggered objective instead
Oh, I could also make 2 objectives, one called RTB VTOL and another RTB AH94

What were you wanting with this?
each vehicle to have a waypoint back to their spawns
2 different cruisers

Okay, how do I specify that mp Spawn 1 has to be landed on a cruiser?
Cant connect the 3
There are AND and OR connectors

How do I integrate the created event trigger (the RTB one) into an objective that has a completion reward?
You don't put it in an event trigger 😛 There's an objective type that is completed by trigger
Yeah you said it but backwards, same thing I think?

Yeah you said it but backwards, same thing I think?
I think I did it
:clueless:

Any way to set a delay to a radio message on a conditional trigger?
I want a radio message to play when the tank is destroyed but not the second it happens
at least 5 seconds later

if I set the waypoint for the infantry I'm delivering, won't they try to swim to it before I pick them up?
Not sure what you mean
So I'm picking up infantry and dropping them off but they are running back to where I picked them up from

There isnt a button to remove the audio file from the brief page, do I just re-make it?
Interesting. Guess so
The game could use some built in TTS

Alright , last thing for today, any way to setup a waypoint for each vehicle at the start of the mission?
So a different waypoint to each vehicle
I'm not sure you can

Could they be dying from the burning VTOL somehow?
an enemy tank?
ye

will they still die to friendly damage?
no?
:lysMath:

the Receive Friendly Damage tag is new, maybe its bugged?
there is nothing friendly shooting at them
Reading between the lines, I believe they want them to take friendly damage so CAS can’t just nuke the entire beach from orbit

im trying to setup a free flight mission on the world v3 map.. how do i actually do that, in the mission editor ive selected the map but if i want it to be mp idk how to do that.. i can only add 1 spawn point
you have to make an MP campaign

and why is that a slider?
If you don’t use the UI budget, it gets cut next year
hi everyone, i'm working on my first mission rn and i need some help. All the AI planes want to take off from the same cat. I tried having them use taxi paths to the cats i want them to go to, but they would just turn around and try to get on the other cat. Am i missing something obvious?

It's pretty much just up to the tower handing out cat assignments. It *should* assign them to different cats though if a bunch of jets want to take off at once. I might suggest staggering the timing of giving the order to take off. If you're telling all the jets to take off at the same time, then they might ask be getting assigned the same cat because it's currently "empty" at the exact moment they are all requesting to take off.
I'll try that, thanks ^^

Not something I've come across before. You can't type in the correct value over the number?
No sir
Guess you're stuck then

Once I upload the mission to steam, can I still make adjustments and update it?
Yup
:peepoGlad:

"Requires link" do I just put a radar next to it or is there anything else to it?
On one of them, the unit properties has a button to assign radars to launchers, or launchers to radars. Can't remember which way around it goes
Thank you

Any way to make infantry follow an IRAPC without assigning the path to each one?
There is a follow option but Idk what he's following
I have no idea what Follow does

how do I create a unit?
hmm
And then tell the group to follow a path in the line formation

no button to create a unit?
Its on the unit properties
got it thanks

Do you have other objectives that have start mode Immediate?
Yes but those dont have auto set waypoint checked
Fixed

are they going to drive under the textures?
As long as it's somewhere close, they'll drive along the ground surface. I'm not sure how far away it'd need to be for them to burrow/fly, or if they even can
ok

Any way to make rocket boats to engage friendly air vehicles?
They'll only engage extremely slow moving/hovering air vehicles
Most air vehicles will fly faster than their rockets

Haven't shot at us, is their range that low?
we were at about 15-20km and they didnt engage us
They fire IR missiles, so anything more than 5km will be pushing it

anything on wheels that is long range?
Found it
The only thing that can move and fire at those sorts of ranges is the MAD-4, and it can't move and fire

so if I have a mad-4 rolling on a path,it wont stop to fire?
Nope
ok

Do I need to do anything special to make a mission multiplayer?
You need to create a multiplayer campaign, then make a scenario in that campaign
Thanks

Will keep that in mind. Currently trying to do a pvp map using this map. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791361448
First time doing a map tbh so wish me luck
Could someone tell me the lowest angle the CWIS and 2x20 AAA can aim?

Just finished the first mission and would appreciate any feedback

Are there any resources for someone to learn the mission editor from zero?
or just, how one creates missions.
Create mission. Pick map. Place player, friends and enemies. Add objectives. Add mission title, description and briefing. Publish to Steam Workshop

Is there any way to make the UI within the Editor not insanely small?
It's not insanely small for me, so *shrug*
I am playing on a 4k Monitor and the Letters are literally the size of an ants foot.

hoe do i rotate units for exampl?
I forgor 💀
Q and E

neat. lets say i want to place a unit in the sky, in flight, is ther a way to change the curser altidude with buttons like wasdqe, or do i have to type in an altidue?
Hold shift and spin the mousewheel
neat

rn, my very simple scenario i want to make is, you take off as an av42 with a single av42 as wingmen, to kill one drone carrier and its drones. i want the wingmen av42 to take off, orbit, and form up once the player is in the air. how do i set up this behavior wof the AI av42?
Using events
Do you want it to take off before the player, or after them?

Do you want it to take off before the player, or after them?
they take off while the player starts up the aircraft, and then forms up on them after the player took off
Trickier, as there's no decent trigger for "starts up the aircraft"

after the player took off and reaches a certain altidue maybe?
You can test for that, yes
Check out the Events tab on the right, and then the Triggered tab at the top of that

so, i f i want the ai to take off immediatly after mission start, i put its behavior to "takeoff"?
Be cautious of the Is Landed state, as player aircraft can spawn a few inches in the air, which counts as flying
Yeah, if it's set to takeoff, it'll taxi and takeoff if it can't take off vertically

how to set that state?
You can't set it. You can test for it though, in the triggered event conditional editor (and other things which allow you to set conditions)
i have made it dependend on altitude and airspeed of the player for now, but how do i link it to the ai doing something?

What've you created that in? A triggered event?
yes

What've you created that in? A triggered event?
yes
i think?

Can you post a screenshot of the triggered event window? The internet doesn't have oen
i think i got it anyways...
it looks like this now, with the trigger conditions and logic stuff being the above image

wont "from on pilot" do?
Not without setting the target leader field
Every aircraft has a pilot, technically

i want the ship to follow a path, i have created one, set the direction, and moved the carrier at the end. will it automatically moce to the first point of the path upon mission start?
If you've set the path to be its default path (in its unit properties) it'll move to the closest point, and follow it
neat

whats the default behavior of an ai aircraft after it took off and didnt get any other instructions? the time between "is in the air" and "Player is in the air, causing it to form up"
in my case
It'll just orbit the airfield.

perfect. Do ai struggle with terrain when in a orbit state? it will take off vertically, and the airfield on "the Island" has those mountains around it...
They're reasonably good at avoiding terrain
i have killed many people by telling them to form up and then flying too low or close to obstacles

will try that if it crashes. If i save a scenario, will it automatically show up in the Custom missions tab? also, i didnt see any way to make it for a specific aircraft...
It'll appear in the custom missions tab, yeah. You set the aircraft that the mission is for in the Scenario Settings (or something like that). It's in one of the menus at the top
ah okay

Is there a way to run mission editor in desktop mode? My laptop, which is my primary PC, has a 960m graphics card, i7 processor, and 16 GB ram. I only wish to create/edit missions and maps. My gaming pc is only for gaming and is attached to my TV & entertainment.
just open the game without a vr headset plugged in
Ethan, I did that. However, there is an end user license agreement for which I cannot accept without a VR controller

Did you edit the right one?

hoe do i tie a Waypoint to a unit so it moves with it?
You can’t

hoe do i tie a Waypoint to a unit so it moves with it?
You can’t
eh?

okay, i want the carrier to be marked with a waypoint that move with it, how do i do that?
In-game waypoints can be mission editor waypoints, or ossasionally units
You can’t

Were they the target of a land or destroy or other objective?
The mission i made, no, it was a rendezvous type mission. Fly to this cruiser, then fly cap until it reaches land
So yeah it was an objective that created the in game waypoint

alright, i want the simple objective of the player having to destroy the drone carrier and all the drones together with his wingmen. would that work?
Use the Waypoint entry in the top bit
Ahz

i know how to make a immediate objective and its waypoint upon mission startup, but i i want a new objective to pop up once the player gets to a certain location, how do i do that?
So you could have one objective for the search bit, which is completed when you find it, starts another objective, to destroy it, which sets the objective on the unit
1st objective: search this area for carrier. Success condition is being within X meters of the ship, which triggers objective 2

how do i give an aobjective a trigger? ai, ship found= start destroy obj
Each new objective you force to start through an event, or you can have objectives start based on when previous objectives are finished
For the objective, set the start type to prereq, and tick the search objective

what unit is this slider? nautical miles? meters? km?
nvm the box below explains it
Everything is meters

i want the objective to be completed once the player is within a certain range of the carrier, but how do i set a "search for" obj that reacts when the carrier is found?
Can you take a screenshot of the options for Objective Type plz
those are the only types of objectives i can set, and the "fly to" wich is the closest to what i need only lets me pick manually set, static waypoints. the "destroy" type lets me select the carrier asa waypoint

probably. A km is not too far or too close right? i might have to tweak that though, as aviation, games in general, and ESPECIALLY this game tend to screw up my sense of scale a lot
The drone cruiser does have a vertical launch missile rack
1000 seems a lot, until you realise that this is less than the min distance for most weapons lol

is there some sort of resource, apart from the wiki, that has details on each units capabilities and ranges?
Nope, because they’re so dependent on other factors
could i set the carrier to only attack once discovered?

could i set the carrier to only attack once discovered?
Yes
There’s a tick box on the unit properties for their ability to attack, and you can use events to turn it back on

should i tick the Engage box?
Yup
what does "PreReqs" standfor, and is this the correct setup to start a new obj upon completion of the last one?

what does "PreReqs" standfor, and is this the correct setup to start a new obj upon completion of the last one?
Prerequisites
And yes

shall i leave it as this start mode?
Tick the previous objective to the left
this?

The first objective should have a different start type (Initial? Start up?)
immediate?
All the rest should have start type prereq with the previous objective ticked

so, there are multible ways to reach the same result in the end?
yes
it's just a matter of organizing them

in that case, like this?
i removed the condition for the player to be near the carrier to finish the objective, and replaced it by being triggered by the "offensive" event
other way around lol

it begins the destroy carrier objective though?
once the search is complete, you destroy it
"Start Event" = When this objective is given to the player, do these things. So you're telling the game, as soon as I give the player the "Search Carrier" objective, I want you to then begin the objective "Destroy Targets"

does ai have the same trouble using weapons that are not faf as players? like, should i give the ai AV42 Agm114 or Agm65?
I expect the AI will be fine at using any AGMs you give it
though you run the risk of the AI just killing the carrier by itself and player wondering what he was there for. XD

btw, i set an obj start mode to triggered, where do i set the trigger condidtion for it? rn, i only know how to use the prereqs and immediate modes
I generally like to give differing missions to the player and AI. something along the lines of "you bring bombs/AGMs/etc to kill these targets, your wingman will bring air-to-air missiles to cover you from enemy fighter threats" or the reverse.
I believe the only way to start that is with an event action

ah, so setting it to triggered, it will let me add it to actions performed by events?
i might do that, starting the search obj after take off, and the firt obj being just to take off
sort of? Again, it's just an alternate way of starting an objective

sort of? Again, it's just an alternate way of starting an objective
It's used more for things like randomized objectives, when you don't know the exact order you want objectives to be completed in (for which you would just use a series of Prereq style objectives)
if you wanted to start search after take off, that's something that will never change, and that's better suited just having the search obj be a prereq objective, and tick "take off"

what would be the best way to detect if a player has taken off, apart from airspeed and alt?
That's actually probably the best way to do it.
there is the "Is not landed" condition, but that will fire as soon as you're a centimeter off the ground lol

Is there a way for me to make aircrafts spawn after a base is destroyed? Like an event? If so how can I do it?
Airbases don't get destroyed. They can only change factions.
What I meant is when an objective is complete

is there a way to have a ships radar off and have it not engage anything until a certain event is triggered, ie, getting within a certain distance of it? I tried setting the "engage enemies" box off, but i was still getting pinged by its radar and being shot at, Waaay before i got within the range i set
this didnt work. the "engage enemies" box is off in the units own settings.
oooooh i had it set sop that the carrier was set to engage as soon as the search obj starts lmao

alright, if i want to set up a small fleet travelling in formation next to each other, whats the best way to do that? Do i set baths for each of them next to each other, or can i just give all of them the same patch and they will automatically hold formation? also, do all ships and boats travel at the same speeds?
If you add them all to the same unit group they will automatically make a formation
amazing

how do i tell a group? i only found a way to tell each unit individually
i set them all as the same group, but i dont see a way to tell an entire group to follow a patch. i punched it into each units manually to follow the same path
I believe there's an event for telling a Unit Group to do something. But AFAIK if you tell the first unit in the group to follow a path, everyone else automatically follows the leader. This does mean that if you put units in a group, *you cannot separate them.*

any way to make gunboats and drone carriers move the same speed?
they all follow the path, but at diffrent speeds, and right behind each other. should i delete the path out of all but one and just keep them as a group?
Use a timed event, Starting Immediately, to give the unit group an event action to follow the path

they all follow the path, but at diffrent speeds, and right behind each other. should i delete the path out of all but one and just keep them as a group?
Use a timed event, Starting Immediately, to give the unit group an event action to follow the path
it only spawns in the group once the player is close to the search waypoint

did that, now delete the path out of the individual units?
so, as soon as the player is locking any of the units with either tgp or arad, the carrier group gets set to engage
Won’t help, won’t harm. The event action will override the default action

Hi Devoss, I use the chance logic box set to 50% in a conditional trigger event to get a random chance of say then spawning a unit. Is this the best way of randomising stuff? Seen a post ages ago mentioning using global values but can't figure out how this would work.
i want to have a troop of infantr, and a convoy of vehicles driving a loop around the airbase so it seems more busy and interesting. i have asingned the infantry and the vehicles to group, and given all of them paths and the correct behavior, but they do not move in the mission
i now set a triggered event with the trigger being "player is landed" wich ias a given at the start of the mission, and the action being both groups being send to their respective paths

Anyone know why some of my ai pilots don't know how to take off? Sometimes they veer off course and start doing donuts cuz they try to taxi back to the runway in full AB
Yep. Arranging into formation
If they get even a little bit off the ground, like a bounce or spawning in just above ground level, they'll assume they've taken off and try to fly

Is there any way to avoid it or fix it? Or just don't spawn enemies on the ground..?
Depends what's causing it. What's the circumstances where they do it?
Well, I spawn them at an airfield and give them a takeoff order. It's a flight of four and they're all given the TO command as a unit group. They taxi normally and then try to takeoff. It's not always happening, but when it does it clogs the entire airfield until the stunt pilot manages to take off (that happened once) or is destroyed.

The airfield is situated on top of a plateau and it had to be significantly flattened when I placed the airfield in the map editor. Maybe thats the case?

I got nothing. Weird
Are you giving them the order the same time you spawn them?

Are you giving them the order the same time you spawn them?
Oh they taxi then mess up on take off. Maybe try staggering the take off orders? Other than that i have no further ideas
Do you mean the initial command to take off(when they are still in the hangars), or them entering the runway?

I figure you mean the initial command, because the ATC is taking care of staggering the actual take-offs for me

Is there a way to open the mission editor/map editor without going through VR first?
when you start the game there is a button on the bottom right
yes, but when I start the game, it boots up my VR headset

is there a way to just bypass the start screen and go straight to the editor?
nope. you could just unplug the VR headset though lol
but it'll still start SteamVR

Can't get rtb way point is spawn to work on stable mp campaign editor. X1 ah-94 initial spawn point on airfield heli pad. Want respawn to be away from airbase in mountains - set way point on another heli pad in alt location ticked rtb way point is spawn and then ensured in edit scenarios under settings rtb way point is set as alt. Still respawns at airfield? Any suggestions please.
Also are rocket artillery enemy ai not working properly? Set them 6km out (pop up says they engage 2-8km) and prioritises targets on the airfield but they just keep targeting a section of the airbase runway - is there a certain type of unit they will/won't attack - I've tried infantry, refuel points , big storage tents and (which in hindsight is probably wrong) parked av42s. What am I missing please?
I'm pretty sure rocket artillery can only fire at a point you specify. they do not attempt to target units (because they can't see them, anyways), they just shoot directly at the waypoint you give them

so if your waypoint for the airport is just in the center of the runway, and you tell them to attack the airport waypoint.... then they're firing at the runway

If i'm following correctly you're trying to move a player spawn and have your rtb waypoint change with your moving spawn?
how can i get ai pilots that take off before me to form up? i'm in the same flight group and player command is set to group only

Try setting a trigger so that when you're airborn or you reach 'x' altitude above ground your wingmen then form up on you (leader or specific unit).

is it maybe because they don't recognize me as leader since they took off before me?
Any way to know where is NORTH in the mission editor
set cursor heading 0

Is this button only bugged for me or anyone else??
SO annoying
doesnt playback the radio call sometimes

is there any way to trigger a radio voice line when the vtol is about to crash? (lost engines, heavy damage etc)
I know you can trigger one if the health is below a certain point
its very hard to tell if a player is about to crash

Is it correct that an AI wingman won’t land at a Refuel point that isn’t an official airbase?
yes and no. you can have aircraft both friendly or enemy land anywhere that is allowed to land. in one mission I even had an enemy vtol capable bomber land on a friendly medium size boat and 'capture' it via triggers. but as far as refueling goes, I believe they will need an airbase, but I'm not sure on that. I think they need to be able to access the tents in the airbase's to resupply. maybe someone else can verify that part
Alright, thanks

how do I make enemy planes attack certain positions?
Planes will attack any enemy unit they find. You generally just need to get them somewhere near where you want them
Are you looking for something different to that?

yeah no, thats perfect. Thank you
If you want them to be focused in their murder, you can give them priority targets using the event action

Here's one for you guys - I'm trying to do a reward mechanic in an MP mission, where completing a side-task gives you more budget. The "Destroy" objective, for example, provides this mechanic. However I want it on a simple drop-off objective. This has a "Completion Reward" value, which I've set, but it doesn't seem to be financial credits as completing the goal didn't change the budget. Am I missing a trick, am I doing it wrong, is it bugged or is it not possible?
I'm not sure if rewards work like that.
I've never used them

whats the hull number on allied ships in the editor?
It’s the giant number painted in the hull
oh

is is possible to have a dropoff waypoint for troops on a moving ship?
static yes. moving no
crap. i assume infantry and other ground units just cant exist on moving ships?

crap. i assume infantry and other ground units just cant exist on moving ships?
They have no physics
The ship will just move out from under them

does it have to be static throughout the whole mission, or can i make it stop and start?
if it move after they on the shgip they will slip as the ship move
You also can’t set a unit as the waypoint for a drop off

how do I add another base?
Bases can only be created in the map editor
You can make farp-like assembles in the scenario editor

Any way I can make a mission complete radio message to work?
Score is... kills isn't it? I don't think your objectives can give kills?
Or is there a different way to add points to score

Score is... kills isn't it? I don't think your objectives can give kills?
Or is there a different way to add points to score
I'm guessing the score total there is actually kills+your 4 objectives, so it went over 100 at some point when 25 was added to it, so it never exactly equaled 100

Hi skumby - just wanted to try some stuff in the editor before coming back to you. Apologies, I now understand what you mean about me having it back to front and can now move the spawn point using the method/trigger event Devoss mentioned. But I wanted to see what the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' check box actually did when checked - as this was what was confusing me. Sorry this is long winded but would appreciate your thoughts - I place a single mp AH-94 (me) on an airfield helipad - this is in stable editor. I don't check the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box in the Ah-94 unit settings - and I don't  choose any waypoint in the edit scenarios - RTB Waypoint option to set Nav RTB button. Go into game - airborne - press RTB in Nav MFD - nothing comes up - as expected. I then check the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box in the AH-94 unit settings - assuming this means - whatever the spawn point is for this unit that is what will show in the Nav screen as the RTB point? - start mission - airborne - get well away from spawn - press RTB in Nav screen - nothing appears. Back to editor - leave 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box checked in AH-94 unit settings and add waypoint to the edit/scenario RTB Waypoint - one well away from the airfield. Start mission - airborne - hit RTB button in NAV MFD and it shows path to waypoint I set in edit/scenario/ RTB Waypoint modal. What should checking the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box do? - and should it override any waypoint in the edit/scenario/RTB waypoint modal - because in the test scenario it didn't.
Do the MP Spawn unit properties have an RTB waypoint too? I know there's one in the scenario options for SP missions
No - just the check box.

Do the MP Spawn unit properties have an RTB waypoint too? I know there's one in the scenario options for SP missions

I would expect that if that tickbox is ticked, when the player belonging to that spawn point presses the RTB button on NAV, it'll set their waypoint to be their spawn point

this amount of drones

you know the "the island" campaign for the AV42?
yeh
kinda like that, but we never left on that carrier and stayed on the island to watch the show

how to i make the drones attack?
Did you equip them with weapons?
I think you have to manually set it for each drone otherwise they spawn with no weapons and fly around like a headless chicken

i know that you can change the equipment of standalone mantas, but is their a way to change equipment of mantas in the carrier?

i know that you can change the equipment of standalone mantas, but is their a way to change equipment of mantas in the carrier?
no, carrier-launched mantas only have their guns
are you sure the carrier and/or drones has "Engage Enemies" checked?

are you sure the carrier and/or drones has "Engage Enemies" checked?
Drones can't carry A2A missiles anyways, AFAIK
There’s no way to order the drones to do anything, as they don’t exist in the mission editor. They’ll auto aggro on enemies if they get close enough

i assume there is no way to change the  status of a unit out of being invincible, but instead we should use the "destroy" action?
when we want to emotionally loose a wingmen
hmm ... every time I try to upload a campaign (only 3 missions) I get this ... "Upload error! LimitExceeded"

I have a question about objective info and how that's presented in your objective mfd page in game. I've got an objective where you need to destroy a number of hostile units, however not all of them are spawned in right away and will be spawned throughout the objective. Will the objectives mfd page only show you the count of targets that have spawned, incrementing the count as more spawn in? Or does it also show you the unspawned ones too as a total count of units to destroy?

It will include unspawned units. Unspawned units are considered alive until spawned in and destroyed.
If you want the total number to be dynamic, you have to use a conditional objective.

Is there way to make a unit "un-invincible"  after its been set as invincible? Currently, I only see an option to set unit as invincible.
how would you change the required number dynamically using conditional triggers?
Well, you can't change the counter dynamically. But if you're willing to forfeit the unit counter then it's just a matter of setting up the right condition tree.

Alright, I think i've got an idea of what to do from here. Thanks for the help!

If your objective's start mode is set to 'Triggered' but it's also set to 'Required', will it still be required to be completed for mission success if left untriggered?
Nope. The mission ends when all **active required** objectives are completed. Inactive required objectives are ignored.
If you're making use of that you have to be extra careful that the next required objective is activated before the previous required objectives are completed, or else the mission will end early.

I have a convoy of units, i've set up their path, formation is set to column, but when they go on bridge only the first unit in group is *on* the bridge, the rest is in the water below. Any ideas on how to fix that? How can you make a convoy not drive under the bridge?
I, uh, "fixed" that in one of my missions by making the units *not* a group, so they don't try to create a formation at all. Just a bunch of units individually following a path that all happen to be in a line. XD
does the "PreReqs" start mode for an objective require all of the ticked objectives to be finished, or only one? i ant to have multible pick up objectives, that all come together at a single drop off obj

does the "PreReqs" start mode for an objective require all of the ticked objectives to be finished, or only one? i ant to have multible pick up objectives, that all come together at a single drop off obj
no wait i can just set the mode to trigger and start the dropoff by having each pickup trigger it
It requires them all to be completed

i assume the "completed event" action triggers once an event is completed?
i just set each of the pick up objectives to trigger the drop off one individually
For an objective, the Completed event actions are performed after the objective is completed

a mission can be completed if there are untriggered and unfinished obj left?
Yup
A mission completes if there's no active objectives left

i i force quip a loadout, can the player land and rearm to get a new loadout?
No
oh

What would be stopping that if you gave them free access to all weapons?
i want the equip they spawn with to be forced and a specific one, but then be able to choose their own later
I'm reasonably sure you can't do that. If you give them the ability to choose a loadout, they'll get the loadout screen when they start the mission, and will be able to pick anything you've allowed there

Hmmm .. strange placement of mobile ground units in rendered game.  I made a small island with city painted fairly dense and put many copies of SAAW, and other Mobile forces into radius roaming patrols and when I tested the mission it worked well but when I tested it through the MP lobby some units were misplaced in the water. I did have apposing units overlapping in some areas and thought that might be the case so I decide on a neutral zone and deleted all units inside. It seems to have fixed the issue but could use more testing. Wondering if bug or feature ?
Ground units in the water is always a bug
they were fishfood for sure. I tried to fly out and search but could not see anything. they did show up on the Nav though.

Max players in one lobby is 16 so that means a pvp mission can be 8v8 max or 16 on each team so 16v16?
16 total
Nvm found that in scenario info tab 😛

is there a way to get into the map/mission editor without loading up VR?

is there a way to get into the map/mission editor without loading up VR?
No, but you don't need VR stuff installed to use it
Once you've agreed to the EULA, there's buttons on the sitting-in-the-carrier-bridge scene to access the mission editor and map editor on your pancake display that you can click on with the mouse

How are player callsigns designated with the multicrew helicopter MPspawns. Is it like, Alpha 1-1 and Alpha 1-2 in helo #1, and Alpha 1-3 and Alpha 1-4 in helo #2?
alpha 1-1 is the designation for an aircraft so pilot and gunner would both be alpha 1-1
that's actually ideal, awesome

Fire control are oriented radar

Do the drone carrier launches the drones it has on its deck, or is it just for show?
they can actually deploy, they are not just for show
I had one set-up in a scenario and set to engage enemy, but it didn't (before it got taken out by my wingman)

Can AI F-45 do short takeoff from the attack carrier? It seems it just taxi to it and stay there (wings still up)
You can use R to skip putting on the helmet, but you must set the scenario to no customization.  Once in, use Insert to pop into debug cam, [ and ] to swap units. Tab toggles a simple gun to shoot things with.  It's more just for mission testing purposes
I noticed this issue on my modded carriers. They taxi forward but get stuck mid turn and fail to completely take off. It's like 50/50 if they manage to take off or not

Is that on the vanilla Wasp LHD? If so, it might be a bug with the F-45s ability to STOL
Cause, afaik, the AV-42 doing STOL worked every time
Both modded and vanilla

I set a path on a highway, but the vehicles set to use that path will not move. Any suggestion to what could be the reason?
`Default Behavior` is set to "Path" and `Default Path` is set to that path?
yes

`Default Behavior` is set to "Path" and `Default Path` is set to that path?
yes
if you have a bunch of vehicles in the same group, can ypu just set the lead one for a path and have the other verhicles set to "follow"? Not the case with the issue I was reporting above

Honestly I forget if that works. The most reliable way to make them move in formation is to use an action to tell the **group** to path.
Thanks @Sypwn , I will try that

Aren't they all drones? Autonomous Superiority Fighter?
ASF is the name of the majority of their planes
Minus the bomber and AWACS

What's the range on the DMS Cruiser's SAM turrets and radar?
Id have to calculate per-aircraft to get radar range, the SAM will fire at 14.5km
But, the RIM-67B isn't a very good missile, its fairly easy to dodge

how do you switch focus on units in the dev cam?
`[` and `]`
oh crap those are diffrent on german keyboards

why are my units not getting destroyed when i set them to? They are invincible, but only because i want them to die at a certain point and not earlier. I have at least two examples of units just not exploding when commaned
Invincible probably prevents it.
it didnt in my last few tests though...

they can also crash into a mountain anddie that way, because they went 1000m off course of the path i set them to follow. why mountains but not the power of god himself?
cant do that. can only set them as invincible, not the other way around
Just uncheck the box and I think that'll do it

oh that action changes the status?
neat
do the explosions that are part of death animations also deal damage like ordanance to nearby units?

you could prob test by putting two tents next to each other, tents are super week but have a massive explosion

If you tell an AV-42C to load passengers and then tell it to take off, will it wait for the passengers to board?
No
Alright, I guess I'll just set a time delay

What is the max effective range of the MPA-155 artillery? The wiki lists max range for the RAT but not the MPA-155.
Unlike the RAT,  I don't see a hard coded maximum engagment range, the bullets can exist for 2 minutes before self detonating traveling at 510 m/s (I think)
So quick math would say it should be able to fire at a 45 degree angle for a range of 26.3km

wait do bullets have air resistance in vtol?
I have no idea
noe

It's kind of like being a meat eater. You could think about all of the pain, suffering and hard decisions that go into meat production (or military engagements)  But why do that to yourself? 😉
Wasn't 30 degrees optimal firing angle for range?
depends if you include air resistance

Wasn't 30 degrees optimal firing angle for range?

As bullets don't have resist in vtol,  best is 45

are you being locked by it?
No, just the passive ping

Does the mission maker have a trigger to clean up dead units in an area? I wonder if that would help with the CPU melting at Charlie sector on dyn lib?
Nope, lol
I've asked for it

If a group lead unit has alternate spawn location, will they also be applied to the rest of the group? If not, how do you set up an alternate spawn identical point for a whole group?
If you set a unit's group set then there's an extra check box in the Alt Spawn tab called "Sync Group" that does exactly what you want.
ah, that's what it is for. Great. Thank you

so, you have to have alt-spawn for each unit in the group, right?
Yes, if the number of alt-spawns don't match then it will automatically add extra alt-spawns to lacking units until they do. But those extras will all have default properties.
do i have to sync-group for each unit or just the lead?

do i have to sync-group for each unit or just the lead?
checking it for one checks it for them all
i see. that make sense

Hi Sypwn - could you just clarify how the alt spawn weighting works. If I have say just one other alt spawn - so two in total - to get a 50/50 chance of either being used do I set them both to 100 (as Spawn 1 defaults to 100) or do I set spawn 2 to 50?.
You set them both to 100

Is there a way to loop events in the mission editor? I'm trying to figure out a way to make a sneaky SAM battery that only lights up its radar for thirty seconds at a time.
The only workaround I found was really, really stupid.
No way to do loops, your best option is to copy and paste the events a few hundred times

That event trigger will only happen once right?
Oh, will it? I was hoping it could happen repeatedly.
it was my understanding that basically all events/triggers can only happen once

I was going to keep a single infantry unit walking back and forth for hours.

how do you get all of that for the editor??
Static Objects menu on the right
allows you to place a bunch of things

If you kill-all a group, do they disappear or just burst into flame/explode/die?
They burst into flames
They’ll even do death radio calls if they’re in your group

Will units follow roads preferentially do do I need to make the path very explicit?
Ground units have no path finding at all
So if I want a tank to follow a road, I have to put their path very explicitly on the road

Is there a way to convert singleplayer scenarios to multiplayer?
The testing cycle for MP missions is insane.  In SP you can just go right into testing.  In MP you have to go through the lobby first
If you are the creator yes

and what about the other way around, convert from MP to SP so I can test faster?
and if so, how is this done?
in both directions

and if so, how is this done?
in both directions
The only way I know of is by hand-editing the mission files in notepad

like when a teams death count increases can I spawn something?
they're up on that hill
They're firing clean over the road and landing in the lake

maybe there's an on-death event?
Events can only fire once
not that i have found.

Is there any talk of allowing some kind of scripting? LUA, python, or even c# for the editor?
oh man, if each event can only fire once then you can't even do territorial tug of war
everything can only START as one side and flip over to the other side once

Any other hopes and dreams I can  piss on? 😛
Jetborne workshop support yes
Man...it wouldn't even be that bad if arty could hit it's targets

and events were intentionally hamstrung?
yes

What's the best way to take fully rendered screenshots for mission briefs? anyone got any pro tips? Only thing is know to do is fly by screenshots which is a bit of a pain and makes muh image quality.
When you spawn in, you can press the insert key on your keyboard to activate a debug camera, letting you move around the map at will and freely take screenshots
(this is done on the flatscreen and not in VR)

nice to have a tool for debugging missions too though, already has been useful quite a bit.   Also, does anyone know of a good way to detect which alt spawn a unit is at? ive tired using the conditional editor with the (unit) near waypoint, and it doesn't seem to work sadly
> ive tired using the conditional editor with the (unit) near waypoint, and it doesn't seem to work sadly  This is exactly how I do it. It works for me.
Note that "Unit near waypoint" and "UniltList any near waypoint" seem to give different results sometimes. I think one is spherical distance and the other is cylindrical.

Hmm, I'm only using "Unit near waypoint" and cranked up the radius to ensure it was in the area with no luck. The only thing I can think that might be different is that my unit spawns immediately, although I did try with a 6s delay with no luck either. I'll have to do some more trouble shooting. Maybe it has to do with it being a multi part navel unit somehow? Or that it spawns too soon?
This is the logic I'm using that doesn't seem to work, is this at all different then what you use?
That looks fine. Can you jump in voice chat and show me around more of the mission?

They can walk through the walls of the building. You can also not spawn the infantry until you want them

If the path end on a building, they will stand on the roof … 🙁

What if the path ends inside a building?
You can’t. The editor won’t let you do that. I suppose u could edit the altitude if the point in a text editor
I swear it used to let you slide the cursor under buildings, but I just tested it and you can't

Will armored units follow a mountainous path (no cliff)? I see the path line in the editor goes into the ground at some location ...
They'll happily drive up sheer cliffs and along the ocean floor
they really will

Anyone know how many time a MANPAD equipped infantry unit will shoot? It seems they fire more than once ... And what's their reload time? Seems it cannot be changed ...
I believe they can fire forever
They’ve got those infinite rocket boxes from HL2

they reload after every shot right?
ugh
They’ll not fire again until their previous missile is resolved

Anyone know what distance (say in Metres so I can use the measure tool in the editor) an enemy tank will engage a friendly tank if they have line of sight?

Hmm ... So, I converted a couple of SP missions to MP, and I'm now trying to create a MP campaign for it. But when I create the campaign, they are not showing-up in the list of missions to pick (for inclusion). I recall that when I created last a campaign, I could pick the missions I had created separately
Yeah, I guess. It's okay if it's not possible though. I just modified the missions to be not training. But they still are not showing-up

Or just use the public_testing build where the bug is fixed.

Thanks Skumby. I was wondering because this is what I did, and I noticed some strange behavior where after the pickup, the av42 started driving back home instead of taking off

I flew the mission again and it happened also. Dunno what's the deal. Maybe it's having a hard time taking off because of weight?
what is the idea?
pm on discord

for proximity triggered spawn events, is the range in miles/km/feet?
everything in metric
so meters

is there a way to move an MP spawn onto a carrier using an Event?
no
Technically if the carrier is stationary you might be able to? Not sure if it will spawn you grounded in that situation.

How would you setup for a unit to randomly pick one path or another? Two different events each with a chance node in the conditional? But then there's always a chance it won't pick either ...
Conditional actions are what you’re looking for. Check out the System event action category

Make sure you don't have the option checked that requires previous missions completed before you can do the next one. I *think* that still exists in MP "campaigns"?
This also, though
That tickbox doesn’t do anything, or possibly even exist, for mp campaigns

Hey! I'm working on my first mission. and I thought it would be cool to have a civilian faction on the map, that if too many died a fail state would happen, have devs ever talked about adding a neutral faction?
Nope, he hasn’t

Question how does one test a MP mission without having to put on there headset every time? I just tried and got stuck at the team select menu...
Can't afaik.
For ground units - the stayinradius behavior where do you define the radius they stay in

is it possible to make a mission (singleplayer or multiplayer) where you can play exclusively as REDFOR?
The ones without a waypoint are likely heading to (0,0)
the game won't let me publish a multiplayer campaign mission that doesn't have at least one BLUFOR player spawn

is that just a bug?
You might have answered your own question there
Not sure if it’s intended, but if that’s how it is, that’s how it is

What if you create a BLUFOR spawn, but set the team size to 0?
whats an orbit point
a point to orbit

how do i set the orbit point?
and yeah, ai planes
ohh

what happens to an ai plane if it's given now orbit point or path?
You mean *no* orbit point or path? In that case it will use its own spawn point as a fallback orbit point.
Oh ok, thank you

If one updates a workshop campaign, does it get automatically updated to everyone that downloaded it (when they start VTOL VR)?
after testing
I have found that more aircraft than player slots are available

hey does anyone know how to automatically despawn enemies after an objective is completed?
yeet them out of existance
you can delete them by exploding them

like setting a kill all command when the objective is completed?
i just dont want a ton of dead stuff killing the fps
It's probably much better for your CPU to kill them than to keep them alive

do they phase through like jettisonned weapons?
Is there a timer as well? Iv killed AI on the ground and a few seconds later they vanish

Quick question: if I make a multiplayer campaign where it's 2 aircraft carrier groups vs each other and one of the enemy carriers get sunk, will the players who were assigned to that carrier automatically spawn on the other carrier? Or will they be lost in purgatory?
Nope. I think they will die on spawn if that part of the carrier is flooded. You can use a trigger to move the spawn point when the carrier sinks, but it has to be to a static air or ground location, not on a carrier. Or you could create enough spawn points on both carriers and let them sort it out in the lobby. Alpha = carrier 1, Bravo = carrier 2, and cap the team size.
how do I finalize the mission. I can't seem to find a command for ending, or final etc... Does it just know?

how do I finalize the mission. I can't seem to find a command for ending, or final etc... Does it just know?
If there are no more active objectives left, then the mission ends in success.
If there are no more **required** objectives left.

Any suggestions to what could be causing that?
A weird path. Weird terrain around the point they get stuck. Unusual method to order them to follow the path. Random chance
I’m still very new to the editor. Struggling with making ground AI work. But it could be all the units try following the exact same point and end up clipping. Could test the follow behavior on some of them

Are they actually in a group? How are you telling them to follow the path?
Yes. I have a timed event that set the path for them to follow
If you watch them when the timed event fires, what do they do?

If you watch them when the timed event fires, what do they do?
I assume they start off not in a tactical blob. Do they vanish, or move underground, or start humping?
I don’t know, it’a far out from the player spawn point

Move it temporarily for testing, or use the insert debug camera

Does the objective have a waypoint set? Does it have the auto set waypoint tick box ticked?
Ah auto set waypoint was off. Cheers
it works in mp

What is the best resolution for the mission and campaign images?
Campaign image must be below 1MB to be allowed to upload to workshop. Other than that, as high as you can go.
Awesome. Thank you for the quick reply

If one set  the objective type to "land" in a MP mission. Will that mean that all players have to land, or just whoever land first there complete the objective?
I think it may have been my "command" to set the formation to "column" that caused that issue. I eventually changed the role of that group to not roaming around, otherwise, they were moving as they should (after not setting the formation), but some where driving on the roof of the houses (the path is in a city)
Any player on that team.

how do you lauch a mission from the mission editor with the quest 2?
I just have to start the game through air link. Go to the editor then on your pc launch scenario
ok. thanks. it wont work on a multiplayer scenario for some reason

"Missions" don't spawn. Are you talking about units? Or player spawns?
Units have a built-in feature called "alt spawns" that do exactly what you want.
Thanks I’ll take a look at that!

is there a trick to this?
What are you trying to do?
And do you have any static objects to do things to?

oil rigs are static objects and can be destroyed, so you can do special things with them

thats the only one i know of

You have a oilrig in your mission?
No oil rig, i thought i could spawn a crashed av42 when a mission triggered
a layer system would be dope yea

Oh so enemy units still pop up if detected?
Good to know

In a MP scenario, will a "all airborne" for a MP player unit group apply to the whole of the group, or just the one that are actually players?

I feel like this should be an option for a trigger ...
How do I delay the initial radio message. It usually plays as I'm spawning in and clips out the first part of it

is there a way to spawn in a refueling point after an objective is finished?
it does not have the "spawn immediatly" box to untick
on a simular note, is there a way to kill or disable a rearming point?

I want to have actual ground crew my wingmen has to drop off at the fob. I dont want the real Spot to be active before the crew is on the ground, and want it to be disabled if all of them die.
But I can't spawn it in later or kill it.

what would be the next best thing then if i want a FOB that is depenend on certain factors, but dont want an airbase? next to beggin baha to add those propertires to respawn points
There are no other options. Players can rearm at airbases, carriers/cruisers and rearm points. I guess the carriers/cruisers are your next best option
You can spawn something else on the fob to physically block it, such as a tent or a bunker.

also is it a known bug that it wont allow me to change the images on my campaigns and missions?

What region did you say the server was in? If possible id recommend looking at moving the server to Europe or America, I wouldn't be suprised if some of the issues you've had are due to region specific issues in a less-popular area
The server provider is based in Greece, though I've seen it connect from Finland as well
It wasn't just my bot that was having issues, everyone in the discord developer servers was freaking out

i have done my best to accomedate the stupidity of ground units by giving them a very nice and detailed path in the center of a road to follow, and yet half of the vehicles get stuck when trying to get into the colloum formation (wich i already placed them in), and the other half drives along the edge of the road at a 45° angle. what else am i supposed to do?
Don't put them in a group and just have them individually follow the path.
ah yes. 20 actions for objective complete trigger

also, how to not have the carrier formation fuck up upon mission start? for some reason it always wants a cruiser to be the lead ship. looks shit if the player is taking off and sees all the ships clusterfucking each other for the lead spot
The formation is based on the order in which you add them to the group. Lead, then rear left, then rear right, continuing left right left right
So remove them all from the group and add them back in that order

i assume same with vehicles?
Probably? Never used vehicle formations myself
where do I get VTEdit?

Dyn Lib uses 99% default actions. @Green can you post a pic of the unit's properties window? Also, use Path , not Railpath
How much of DynLib has land unit groups moving in formation?
If they are starting and moving in a line like that, they don't need formation.

Unless you want them to stop and re-form when a unit dies

How are they moving instead? Screenshot would be excellent
alright, give me a moment
@Skumby they move like this, clipping through buildings

Doesn't column form them up in 2 columns?
I don’t think so, but there’s plenty of options there! One for every occasion
its fixed!

Is anyone trying to make a mission similar to the one in topgun 2?
I’m amazed there’s not 30 already
movie not been out long enough yet

is there a way to assign a multiplayer spawn to a carrier slot with the Move Spawn event?
No
damn

Alright... So who's making the top gun mission recreation?
uhhh
C talked me into the thought 2 hours ago

does the airbase start out as enemy? otherwise i doubt the bombers will be able to taxi
save, close and restart the editor
itsa know bug. after that, they should show up

what are you using to tell the bombers to take off? events, objectives? trigger?
triggers
conditional

is their path free? arethey placed weirdly?
they're placed like this
can i see the units page of the bombers?

can i see the units page of the bombers?
i think bombers are too large for the tents.
i might be wrong, but if the ai does not think it hasenough space, it wont taxi. try placing them somewhere else

but how do I make it trigger if they detect a plane?
like this?
By team enemy

What do you wish to do when the RADAR sees them?
Need to break the debug up into two parts
Stick a System -> Tutorial Message in that event's actions too

but how do I set up the logic??? what cinditions do I use?
With your current conditions you have
add 2 events that fire both when the RADARs detect and when the bombers take-off

how do I do that system tutorial message?
like this?
yes

and will the message be displayed to both players?
or only 1?
to all players

both types of infantry are allowed right?
Ye
nice

how many infantry can be carried?
8
oooh

Is it possible to make a resuply point spawn when infantry enters an area?
I cant make it start despawned
No

oh  what about if I switch the airfields team? will we be able to resuply on the airfield then?
Yes, at the usual locations
The pads and the hangars

whats the range on rocket artillery?
And does in increse if theyre high up?
very far

And does in increse if theyre high up?
very far
there isnt really a number

how do I get them to target an aproaching ship?
If they see it they will target it
You can set the ship as a priority target via events

can they use an AWACS radar tp target?
Although Im not sure how good rocket arty is against carriers
no

what about the other kind of artillery?
RADARs can datalink with planes, so can ships im pretty sure
I thought the artillery had to use waypoints to fire?

I thought the artillery had to use waypoints to fire?
ould these truck see those ships?

oh, how do I set up the waypoints then?
moving

moving
ah

want the awacs to give radio comms? use their actual va
no
didn't aruchanal incident use you

ok how do I get Aty to fire on a waypoint?
and its inacurate, right?
Use an event

@hidearimjosh So Carrier Command 2?
Or that spaceship one
Damn it's already a thing?

I mean the vr in the game is an afterthought, so its not very good, I get easily dizzy. And I've never been dizzy playing vtol vr (+200 hours)

How do I set another wave of enemies to spawn after the immediate spawn wave is splashed? Would it be through events?
Yup. A triggered event
gotcha thank you

applies even if they're single-unit waves?
oh if it's only a single unit then yeah doesn't matter
gotcha

ah ok, so even if 'start immediately' is ticked, the parameter will still need to be met for it to actually trigger?
yes, the conditions must always be met to advance the sequence
alright sick, thanks again

Is there a condition you can specify that AI will not fire at you until X time has passed?  It'd be nice to create a 1v1 guns mission where they don't shoot on the merge
You can set them to not engage, but then they won't manoeuvre to engage you either
Then use a timed event to turn them back to engage later

Could you set a path?
Always
example, hot spawn your craft about 20 seconds from the merge

Is there a way to have aircraft automatically take off and engage ships detected by an AWACs?
you can order them to take off
and set a default waypoint on the spawn to go to the ships

if I set a path for bombers that passes close too the ships, will they target them too?
should

Hello, this is my first mission/map so bear with me. I have found that it takes ages to load (sometimes more than 30 min). Some kind map designers (don't remember names, just I know one made dynamic liberation) told me it could be an issue with cities taking up too much CPU space on loading. I want to take this project seriously and am open to any and all suggestions. Here is the Steam Community page for the mission: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2815386580 Edit: since the linked file was uploaded, I have reduced the size of the cities and removed irrelevant ones, which helped load times.
Canada finally gets what it deserves

if you make a mission in Public Testing, will it just become unavailable in later versions?
Any time that question is asked people say "yes", but in my experience no. I've even played 1.4.4 missions that use the new MAD-4 missile in 1.4.3 just fine.
Oh, I assume you mean "earlier versions"

like, if I were to make a mission with the PT editor, would that not be transferrable to the main game once v1.4.4 comes out on the main branch?
Oh, that will definitely work

Not currently.
team a when no MAD 4 or ESuperMissile

Is there a way to change a base from red to blue in the mission editor?
yeah just select it in "bases" and change the team from enemy to allied
Yes, but can this be changed while the mission is running?

Yes, but can this be changed while the mission is running?
yeah u can
Thanks, I'll have to check this out.

Is it possible to have/do global variable persist between missions in a campaign?
No
I hope we can get that one day, that would make more dynamic campaign possible

hey where do i make a map multiplayer? I looked at what other ppl where saying answering this question before but I don't see the checkbox
The map itself is separate from missions you make with it
When making a campaign, there is a checkbox to make it mp-only

ohh u have to make it a campaign?
Yes, unfortunately standalone missions are not supported yet
That being said, you can just make a campaign of 1 mission

other question is there a team b based tanker?
no but both teams are able to refuel from it i think
Is anyone else having issues with the conditional editor either not selecting nodes or changing everything with conditional to the same thing?

Is anyone else having issues with the conditional editor either not selecting nodes or changing everything with conditional to the same thing?
Hopefully he'll fix it soon. In the meantime, you can make the actual objective type something impossible ("land" with no waypoint set should work) then use conditional events to complete the objectives.
It can probably also be fixed directly in the .vts file but I don't recommend trying that until you get pretty familiar with the rest of the editor.

N00b question: how do you make a limited respawn MP mission?
you can check mpdeath or mpspawn get killed to increment global var
At that’s what it is for. Thanks

but how do you prevent it from respawning?
put them in jail
... or is it just decrease a variable and fail all objectives once that number reach 0

do I have to restart the game or something?
I’d like to see a built in way to set the numbers of available aircraft and the numbers of available weapons for a whole campaign
The number of respawns/tickets available is doable with the in-game logic already

But does anyone know how to fix this?
Did you try quitting and reopening the campaign? The error states the campaign name and description are invalid.
But they look fine on the left.

Did you try quitting and reopening the campaign? The error states the campaign name and description are invalid.
But they look fine on the left.
Yes, definitely a kludge though. But no way to limit weapons quantities

is it possible to limit the weapons that can be equipped at the start of a mission (for a given flight), then allow more options once the flight has landed?
No
Maybe

Yo, got a boatload of questions being that I started making maps and using mods since legit 2 days ago. Would I be able to get some help?
Yup
OK good looks, lemme just write this all out gimme like 2 mins

OKay deff found help with what I watned, but still have some questions. First off, will wingmen actually speak to the player in a playtest, being that they haven't at all even when set to player commands. Second, I want to basically hand-hold the player into taking control of a squadron upon takeoff by using the PTT comms feature, but I can't seem to get the tutorial messages to fire in order just like the in-game tutorial. Do I have to seperate each of the messages into different events and then make them fire each other after time delays? Thirdly, the (System - Play BGM) feature just doesn't seem to work. I hit the test button and nothing happens, and of course in playtest nothing happens. I know it's a playable audio bc I have it as a custom MP3 in my planes themselves.
Yes, yes, yes
VTOL VR is fussy about the MP3 files it accepts

yea see I have three unit groups, each of them for each player that spawns in one of those three squads. upon takeoff I'm trying to have the game tell them (With a radio message) that they are commanding that squad, to which the tutorial messages goes over the thumbstick and says "Use PTT to command ___ squad" and then a quote on the cockpit windshield says "Wingmen, form up." However, I'm getting the radio message and the "form up" message, which is making me think all three messages are indeed firing, but only the last one is being displayed. So would I just have the first message fire, wait x amount of seconds, then have a separate event fire the next message after that amount of time?
Also, the wingmen aren't speaking, dk why but
Ah. Wingmen don't work in MP

I though Baha sorted that before weekending off into the sunset?
he did?

Can someone advise how I make a respawn loop?  I've got a trigger condition of "unit is not alive", and set the unit.  Next I want the new unit to spawn in the same place, but it isn't doing it at all? Does it spawn in a random place? I say this because the map is....quite large.
Units can only spawn once. Events can only fire once
Ok, so I have to just keep adding units and triggers?

Ok, so I have to just keep adding units and triggers?
Yup
Ok cool, thanks @Skumby ☺️

how do I allow all Vehicles to be used by the player?
You can't
damn

I get that not every building can be destructible, but a couple infrastructure targets would be interesting. Maybe: power plant (lights in city go dark?),  Enemy hideout (small simple building), radio/communications node.   Add a couple civilian vehicle types and the possibilities would go up a lot.
A very good way around it right now is creative interpretation
Plop down a few farm buildings for a water treatment plant, shove a bunker where the control room or something explosive like a flocculation building would be

Can ANY building besides a bunker be destroyed?
tents, bunkers, oil rigs (the feet, the tower and another part I forgot)
Gotcha.  Thank you

how do i make a mission multiplayer compatible? i have set up 2 bases but i can only add one player spawn in 1 team

Mind posting your player log? There might be an error in there that explains why
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Is there a way to have surface to air radars turned off until an event happens?
yes, uncheck the "Engage enemies" box. you can have an event that will set them to engage enemies and they will turn on radar and then start looking for things to shoot
Quick thing ya'll: I have an allied fleet consisting of an aircraft carrier, assault carrier, and a few cruisers. All of them are set to different paths like in the adivce I gave bro above^^ However, for some reason my rightmost carrier just decided to put on Deja Vu and always consists on drifting into the whole fleet like he went AWOL. he's set to a default of navving a path but doesn't want to, and I even traded him out for a regular carrier thinking it was the ship type that was bugged. Could it be that he's only carrying F45s and there's some random behavior idk ab these ships?

oh hadn't spotted that yet, thank

Honestly is there anything they did not do to the 130? It's a troop and cargo transport, gunship, apparently carrier capable and now they strap rockets on it. Why not just retire every other airframe and just use this plane as your alrounder
Also sorry but no lol  Check out the NotBDarmory mod though, it actually let's you rocket boosters to your aircraft.
Also can drop cruise missiles

Does the SAAW not engage munition threats like HARM’s?
I can’t seem to get it to engage incoming missiles
SAAW is a fairly low tech/small unit, it’s radar is likely incapable of intercepting missiles

If missile intercepting is needed, dosnt AAA do that job better?
It’s static though
Does the enemy get a AAA truck? I thought it was only the allies that had it

Does the enemy get a AAA truck? I thought it was only the allies that had it
If you need mobile, MAD4 works
Well can’t shoot and move at the same time

Is the missile controlled by the radar unit? because would adding more radars solve the limited engagements
More radars would fix yeah
You’d need more launchers tho, iirc a launcher can only have one radar

How would I configure it to prioritize missiles?
Yeah one TEL can only engage a single target at a time
One TEL to one radar does allow multiple missiles to a target but I’ve yet to figure out how to designate one to target missiles because they only seem to target my aircraft

Hi all! Just started learning how to do mission today cause i just love this game and always thought it could be so much more with a scenario i have in mind since launch , but that i've never find online yet. So i just raised up me sleeve and dive right in, and i must say.... god! didnt thought it was a tool so well made, simple and yet so powerfull!!! But i got some question for the veteran mission builder. Is there a place somewhere in the editor where i can use static objet (like dock, house or scenario thing) to use in some event?
yea! 😛
What do you mean "use in some event"?

What do you mean "use in some event"?
You can place different types of static options either in the map or in the mission.
like if a unit is near a dock for x time, start a event

didnt remember but... is the scenary object destructable?
Only the oil rig
another one ... is new unit in the game moddable? like introducing a new type of building or such?

another one ... is new unit in the game moddable? like introducing a new type of building or such?
With mods, yes. https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/7ekcqp7f/
But that means someone will need to be running this mod to play your mission.

so cannot upload to the workshop "fire and forget" without telling to player to download the package i presume?
Do I have any means of duplicating a mission so I can make 2 slightly different versions of it?

Anyone know what a negative kill score means for a player in a multi-player game? (e.g. -40)
teamkills
although I've seen it glitched, once I got something like -70 even though the infantry I was shooting at was definitely the enemy

couple question for you guy.... 1-Is it possible to offer the possibility (in sp mission) to the player, to choose his plane at mission start? if so, how? 2- In a campaign , can we use some data of the previous mission in the next (like global number variable or X plane left in the previous mission) to include in the start of the new one? 3- i know its a dumb question but.... how i im supposed to put a player spawn point? didnt find the info anywhere! :\
No, no, it's in the player category
ok thanks!

will an unspawned unit still count as "near waypoint" if they are within the zone but not yet spawned?
No
thanks

Is it possible to set up a final condition to make everyone land to end mission not just one player? every thing I try doesn't work
just one
That's a shame, it always annoys me when people leave without landing.

Does this work ? or it only trigger for one player?
I've tried that with all airborne for a take off and it didn't work. I think it needs all of them even if they aren't spawn in
Yeah :/ then its a bug

how do i get a drone carrier to launch it's drones?
Events
I've seen it before in some missions but the ability to spot something on tads and it will trigger an event, how is that done?

No, but now it looks like the whole map is gone ... WTF?
so you cant access this button in the mission editor.

Problem is that I can't get into the editor with that scenario, but I guess I can do it with another scneario

was the directory named differently?
No, it was the same. I don't know why deleting some mission within the campaign also deleted the map ... possibly a bug
weird.

Any mission editors know how to set up protect objectives on a group of ships?
I have the ships in a sea group already
but the protect obj seems to be one unit only?

but the protect obj seems to be one unit only?
I'd use a conditional objective instead
can you leave the success field empty?

can you leave the success field empty?
ah looks like you can
thanks

will any of the enemy AI planes attack friendly ships?
the bombers and the UAVs don't seem to want to do it
Yes, if you give them air-to-ground weapons. Rockets or bombs.

How do you give an attack order?
You can add them as designated targets
They are automatically revealed to the AI and they will immediately go toward it and attack it, stopping at nothing

is that done by setting the objective for team b and then designating each of the targets?
You use events. There are actions for each unit to "set priority target" and "set designed target" IIRC
ah fantastic, thanks

First timer here, how does setting up PVP missions work? I got the campaign and map and everything, but the enemy team can't use the friendly team's units including the playable vehicles, so how would I set up spawns for both teams?
Ah, I see the player tab now
What's the max amount of players one scenario can have?

What's the max amount of players one scenario can have?
16
Do I need to do anything specific objective wise for a simple team deathmatch mission

How would one do that?
Uhhhh good question, I haven't used the pvp features of the editor
😅

do the bombers ever attack more than 1 target? Or do they blow their wad on one and then dip?
nope
they have either 4 x 32  or 4x16 bombs by default i think

What happens when you try?
whenever i try to edit this screen shows up
the loading never stops

https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/985344677404364800 Does this sound like something you've done? I've seen a couple of reports like this issue recently, where before there was none
yes thats exactly what i did
Exciting

Have you ever repacked a map in the scenario editor?
@Warbuc06 ^
yes

How did you repack it when you weren't able to load the map in the editor?
the stuff in the top left corner was still interactable
in my screenshot you can see that the tabs are still there

The mission(s) you deleted - were they the only ones using that map?
yes
all of them used the same map

So your campaign had a load of missions that used one map, and some other missions that used other maps?
i only had one other mission in the campaign and it used the same map it was also the first in the campaign order when i deleted it
Open `...\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\<Your Campaign Name>` It contains all the scenarios and maps that your campaign uses See if you can see which map is missing Then goto `...\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomMaps` and copy the missing map into your campaign directory

Does ScenarioTest#1.5 use the Korengal map?
yes
thats the one ive been trying to load

... ok. What's in the Korengal_1725346568 directory?
Ok. Gonna have another go at reproducing this
Ok, so when I create a scenario with that map, I get extra bits in my map folder that you don't have

so i need to replace them?
Still checking - I really want to make this break
alr

Nope. Can't. Steam workshop download is in `Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\667970\1725346568` . What do you see in that directory?
Is what the map directory in my campaign looks like
So you need to copy `height.pngb` to the map directory in your campaign directory

And maybe you'll be sorted then?
ill try it
so i went to the file to copy height.pngb but now even more is missing

maybe i should replace the entire file?
Sure, but the `WorkshopItemInfo.xml` isn't necessary/might be harmful
ok

@Frenchy Does the above look anything at all like the problem you encountered?
made a new mission in the campaign, attempted to edit ScenarioTest#1.5 and encountered the same issue
it said it had to repair the mission order again

how do i send the entire campaign file?
it says the file type is not supported
You'd put it in a zip file, but don't worry about that until Baha says he wants it

Can you post a log file next time you add a scenario? That's clearly where it's breaking, and I've only seen a log file from when you tried to load the scenario afterwards so far
here you go
i added a third scenario after having no issues with the other two

What's in the campaign map directory? The log's complaining about a missing file again
Yup, it's gone again 😄
why did it load normally this time then

Im curious, would you have those files in a normal scenario too?
The map is inside the scenario directory, rather than the campaign directory, for single scenarios
this is also following my camera in the editor

but you are working in a campaign, right?
The bug is happening in a campaign, yes
can you post your vtm/vts/vtc files? IIrc this has something to do with a weird ID/name miss match

can you post your vtm/vts/vtc files? IIrc this has something to do with a weird ID/name miss match
By normal, do you mean single player?

By normal, do you mean single player?
is this what you are talking about?
I  had issue with .ogg file being present in a scenario and also a separated  campaign scenario,  failing to play.  Like if the game is indexing everything then use the file, Where ever they are. (removing the single scenario, fixed it in the campaign)

thats one of the files, there should be a few others, specifically a `.vts` file

Sure. Would you find that helpful? It's just a binary mess for me
this is what i have
I can decrypt it if needed

so i just need to change the name to Korengal and it should work?
I would try changing the folder name to just `Korengal` and updating the map IDs to `Korengal`
You said this was a workshop map right?

You said this was a workshop map right?
yes
Has anyone confirmed workshop maps actually *work*? I wouldn't be suprised if the game tries to append the workshop ID to the map ID but isn't correctly updating the internally listed id

Has anyone confirmed workshop maps actually *work*? I wouldn't be suprised if the game tries to append the workshop ID to the map ID but isn't correctly updating the internally listed id
I created two scenarios in a multiplayer campaign using the Korengal map, and it didn't break
Well then I have no idea, the other possibly weird thing is `ScenarioTest1.5` has the ID `ScenarioTest#1.5`

Dunno if that is breaking it?
bruh
all this trouble over a # sign

If i set an alternate spawn weight to 1 will it never happen randomly?
or if it does how do i change player spawn mid-mission
It will have a 1% chance of being used.

i downloaded the map as a free flight, will that be editable in the editor?
or does it need to be a certain file
Sorry?

is there a way to make units fire at something even if they dont have line of sight?
If they're artillery, yes
Otherwise, no

how hard is it to make a 1v1 thing?
Should be pretty easy
i have 0 experience with doing this

ok great, how much stuff would i have to do?
Depends how fancy you want to get
sorry for being a pest, just want 2 planes, any weapons

can i add the other planes from the wiki like the ASF-58?
Yes
And the simple 1v1 mission creep begins 😛

Hey ya’ll. has anybody gotten screwed over for using copyright music in the mission editor? Wanted to add a track but really dnt feel like getting sent to the shadow realm over it
No one has gotten in trouble for it, I believe its *technically* reportable via steam but steam will just take the workshop item down
That would be if someone reports it tho right

One more question: Is it possible for the MP test to actually be played in MP? Like can I get a freind of mine to play the test with me to make sure his side of the story carries out correctly and for balancing reasons? Or is it only solo playtesting
Reason being I do want to try to make a MultiCrew Mod mission, but that involves testing it with MultiCrew actually being used
Just upload it to steam, make the picture something like "**DO NOT USE: WIP**" and boom ur good

"involves testing it with MultiCrew" have we ever played the Desert Door Gunners?
yeah
i don't know if it works

Is there a way in the editor to make, on a "OnEnter" enemy proximity waypoint do an Action on all vehicule who enter it, instead of a specific single unit??
I try to make the enemy, when they reach X waypoint, to move to another waypoint randomly.... but the way i see it in the editor, it look like i have to manually program each single unit in the conditionnal trigger type for it to work, and nowhere it seem like a "batch" unit to choose from
Nope. Events can only fire once

Is there a way to force players to not be able to go above a certain height?
yes
I have no idea how

is there a way to make multiple possible RTB areas? I have 2 cruisers that are potential RTB's each of them field a different MP vehicle.
I would preffer if there was a way to tell each person to go back to their own cruiser.
much thanks, I'll see if my current iteration for it works. I want it to be an or so whoever makes it back first finishes it.

how do you take a conditional objective that if failed is mission failure but there's not really a completion criteria to complete on actual mission success?
You can just not have any logic for the completion
but then the mission will not complete porperly or am i missing something?

but then the mission will not complete porperly or am i missing something?
it is several targets that cannot be destroyed the entirety of the mission or its mission failure.
truing to figure out how to get it clear at the end or just only count as critical if destroyed.

thats full out coding isn't it?
not exactly
Just mildly advanced scripting lol

is there another workaround for it?
It doesn't have to be that complex. If it's as simple as "don't let this happen", then once you complete the final objective in the mission, just set it to complete this objective
e.g. Objective 1, don't let your carrier sink -> fails if your carrier is destroyed Objective 5 (final), destroy the enemy HQ's bunker -> on completion, set objective 1 to succeed

do I use the actual name you put on the objectives?
Obj 1 = don't destroy X target, begins on start Obj 2 = go to waypoint, begins on start Obj 3 = blow up thing, begins on completion of Obj 2 Obj 4 = RTB, begins on completion of Obj 3, on completion it completes Obj 1
all the other objectives work fine, I just need an objective to lear with the last one of the mission.

I forget where it is in the actions menu, I think it might be under system?
just as an event?
But there's an action to complete an objective and it just has you select from the list of all objectives in your mission

how exactly do the Entry and Exit Conditions work for Event Sequences?
You can have it so that when they are detected they die
thats what it is, when they are seen on tads they are killed

I'm trying to remember if I've played that one, is it the one with the convoys stopped on the road?
It has a city of patrolling "allied" units, and you have to spot which ones are secretly the enemy based on their unit types and formation.
Then blow up only those units.

Someone know how i can do a random waypoint? Ive tryed a couple thing but nothing work! What i mean is "if vehicule X arrived at waypoint Y, then it have a 50% chance to go to waypoint A or B"
I don't even think the guy that died died from a missle or gun he crashed I'm pretty sure.
The waypoint's location can't be random, but you can use a Conditional Action and the Chance condition to make a 50/50 chance of telling that unit which waypoint to move to.

you got something you need to say, dragon boi?
:whatChuJustSaid:
yea! now i see! i made exacly what you showed.... but instead i was adding another ELSE IF for the other waypoint!

so for the else i cannot put another 50%? what if a put another loop of the same action?
You technically can, but the actual probabilities are deceptive.
and does the event only happen once or it alway happen if the unit is near the waypoint again?

and does the event only happen once or it alway happen if the unit is near the waypoint again?
Events can only trigger once
really??? fuck! 😦

is it possible to get AI units to jettison their own fuel tanks?
i had to make hundred of event if i want a truly dynamic mission.... a
Not that I can see

Any one knows exactly why negative score happens? I though it was maybe because the players were accidentally destroying allied forces, but I made all allied not able to receive friendly damage and I'm still seeing negative score. Is it because enemy forces are destroying some of the allied forces?
iirc there's a bug where if the host starts a new mission then kills from the first mission get carried over to the next as negative
wouldnt be surprised if it has something to do with switching teams on the next mission

are you restarting the mission at all?
or do the negative scores appear in the middle of the first play through?
no restarting

or do the negative scores appear in the middle of the first play through?
no restarting
ah interesting

Hey guys, what does the "follow function actually for land vehicles? Do I have to designate a target to follow?
Jesus I cant type... I meant to say "What does the 'follow' function actually do for land vehicles?"
I’ve played with it a bit, and have never worked it out

Are there any shared missions that people use as templates? Or that they're willing to share?
Like, your mission got bugged and can't load anymore? Can you PM me the mission files?
like a github?

I think @AtrociousAmbition/Mr. Charisma was working on something like that.

@BurntPineapple is there something you're confused how to do? If you have an idea for a mission you want to make, I can walk you through how to achieve it.
Why does my pick up objective get skipped and the mission completes before I pick up anyone?
Is that objective not set to "Required"?

Oh wait It might be because I had it's start mode as triggered instead of prereq
yeah that was it

better for the community no?
ah, yes

ask the dev? hes literally here in this chat speaking to you
Oh my god it’s the same argument as earlier. Remove control from a creator just because some other people want it to be different :agony:

How do I make an objective to fly along a path?
You can set a series of waypoints to be followed
and turn on the setting to automatically cycle them

anyone know why my sound files and music files work when i launch from the editor but when I launch my mission from the downloaded multiplayer campaign from the workshop they dont trigger? everything else in the mission works fine

Why is Mobius in B7R? 🤨
It looks like some of the audio files are duplicated in two places for some reason. 1. `\The Round Table\b7r\` 2. `\The Round Table\Example\radioMessages\b7r\`
yeah i think its from before I moved it... might delete the current workshp version and reupload it fresh or smth

are the audio files supposed to also be in CustomScenarios? it won't let me choose from any files other than in EditorResources for the audio files
I assumed they would be copied there, but maybe not. I haven't worked with them in a while.
If they only reside in EditorResources, then yeah try removing the mission from the workshop and re-adding it. Might also want to try re-selecting each audio file in your mission triggers as well.

Do you have that MP mission as a single scenario too?
I’m trying to think of some fun missions to make… anyone have any suggestions?
hmmm i will check but it also isnt playing the background music. checked my voice, bgm, and in game music volume, didnt think about the radio volume

it is an mp scenario in an mp campaign. i copied the audio files from the editorresourcesfolder to the customscenarios folder for the mission too and didnt seem to do anything

is maybe one of these an issue?
these are the 3 places where my audio folder is currently residing for the mission
but i dont have any SP missions with that audio data, its only in these 3 folders

i was gonna use someone else but it never sounded good, glados was the best sounding voice that wasnt a pony?

and less lag?
Yay I might be able to run that at more than 10 fps

do you know what is causing the lag in the map currently?
mostly the unit counts
is there any golden ratios that get thrown around in terms of how many AI units you can spawn before you start to lag?

fighters cause far more cpu use than tanks

@BahamutoD do you have any insight as to what is the biggest resource hog in missions?
ah yes, the 12:40am dev ping
If Baha added some way for the mission triggers to tell the engine "these units won't be used, please permanently delete/unload them from RAM" then I would use it.

somebody has to have tested unit counts before no?

it does somewhat, but not much

how many units does that one have?
There I formatted it a bit more reasonably
oh, my dumbass, thank you

how many units is your new faster map?
on Easy, about 15-20% of the units spawn in
still the same because in that mode you will randomly start outside sector A, B, or C. You just have to clear that one sector to complete the mission.

i7-11700 base clock is 2.5Ghz and boost clock is 4.9Ghz. Where are you getting 3.6 from?

Anybody have any insight to why radio messages only play for the host in a multi-player steam mission, and not anyone else?
How do i make a actual made take off objective in the multiplayer campaign mission im making i dont know how
Not sure what you mean

Can you take a screenshot or two?
I will tmrw im off now
unfortunately no, it check all MP spawn also when not present

Hey folks, I was wondering if there is a good way to display text to all players in a MP lobby when an event triggers. I've been trying to use the tutorial message action but the text only appears on the Host's screen. Is what I want to do possible?
That's an excellent question, I believe text used to display on all screens.
I recommend you report that as a bug in #public_testing or #vtolvrdev

I also tried using a team radio message - which only plays for the host. Is that unusual as well?
I've only used the messages for all players, but that sounds unusual yes
Just to verify. I'm using the System -> Tutorial -> Display Message. Is this what you are also talking about?

Just to verify. I'm using the System -> Tutorial -> Display Message. Is this what you are also talking about?
Yes
That *should* go to all players

alright this may sound a bit odd but how do i update a map?
i've added a few things to my campaign mission but im not entirely sure if it has already updated the map to the workshop
How do I make a takeoff objective for molutplayer campaign

wont that just dupe it?
What sort of takeoff objective did you have in mind
No, it'll update it

For one plane, or some planes, or all planes?
sweet
all planes

So maybe not so much removing the randomness, but making it only one or two cities long?
Yeah, and I just showed you the condition tree to achieve that.
Yes, this is already planned. A version where you only have to complete a single sector.

can anyone help me with chance events? if I want 1 of 5 events to trigger after a unit is destroyed do you set up 5 chance triggers all set to 20% and set them to all trigger on unit death?
Nope, because then you might get more than one of them firing
You want to use conditional actions

ok and how do i make it so you can choose between them in briefing???
You can't
yeah you can

You're doing a multiplayer scenario?
i want to make one yeah
You need to create a multiplayer campaign, then create a scenario inside that

whats the unit of radius ?

what does the hull number mean on the ships?
it's its designation set by the mission maker
is the number is 69 or 420 it means that the ship is based otherwise it's just a number

how to set MP player spawn on a carrier?
in the carrier's settings
you can add vehicles to spawn on it in there

Uhhhh, can you reword the question?
basically i want to force a unit to spawn at an alt spawn

Uhhhh, can you reword the question?
basically i want to force a unit to spawn at an alt spawn
so can i spawn in the unit *and* force the unit to have that alt spawn at the same time?

so can i spawn in the unit *and* force the unit to have that alt spawn at the same time?
Yeah, that should work as long as the set alt-spawn action is above the spawn action. Although I haven't tested it.
ok thanks

how do i get the desert camo jets on a mission?

i think desert camo skins are bugged

Hey, im new- can anybody tell me how I trigger the 'successful end' of a mission? I have a handful of objectives, and I want my last obj to be to RTB... but then I want the mission to end once the players are on the ground within the radius of the base, alive and stationary.
im happy to hop in a voice channel for this too if that helps..
I don't have the editor in front of me, but there is an objective type of "land" that lets you set a destination waypoint, and an objective start type called "final" or something that makes it the final objective that only shows up after all others are completed.

far as trying to sort of play-test a bit, is the only option for MP to just put it up on workshop and link it to buddies as-is? this game doesn't support like, host can host and the joiners will DL the content... right? (unsure if that makes sense...)
Once you've uploaded it to the workshop, you can open the workshop page for it in steam and change it to "Unlisted". Then the only effective way for others to get it is to have them join your lobby.
Just note that every time you update the mission it will revert back to Public. Which is something I've been meaning to mention to @BahamutoD

but so if i just make it 'unlisted' then whoever joins my private MP lobby will automatically download what they need to play my mission if I'm hosting it?
yep
wicked

@Sypwn you know of any links that could show me how to use global values? i feel like i need them... trying to make an obj where players merely detect a certain number of a total number of enemy stuff...
or trigger... doesn't really matter... just trying to figure out how to do something like that in the conditional logic screen
ex: there are 5 radar stations and 3 SAMs. i want to make a scouting objective 'complete' after the player (or allied AI) detects like 6 things out of 8

ok, so that's how you can use global value? you can just like, tick it up one for every 'true' conditional completion that happens?
im trying to imagine like an 'and-or
i would fire 8 conditional actions upon objective start up

for proximity trigger events in multiplayer missions, does the *Player* option in the *Triggered By* setting respond to just *any* player entering the waypoint radius?
I imagine so
a lot of mission editor stuff is still unoptimized for multiplayer mission making

@Sypwn or anybody else- i might have asked this before... but when pathing ground units such as trucks/tanks, do they sort of automatically prefer to stick to roads if it's loosely the path, or do I need to get VERY precise with my paths?   also, anybody know how the behavior setting 'StayInRadius' works?
There is NO snapping to roads. Your tanks will stick to the path you make...usually.
F

when i make a waypoint, is there a way to cycle through waypoints that have been 'made visible' or whatever? like, can I set a bunch of pre-made waypoints that are points of interest that players would be able to toggle through that aren't related to objectives?
no, outside of the refueling and RTB waypoints
ok, so basically only bases will have waypoints... well, and objectives that you've associated a waypoint with (whether static or a given unit)

does anyone know why I get this error when I clearly have spawnpoints? all the 45's and f16's are MP Spawns
Tastes like mods to me
no mods

Where are the F-16s coming from?
hopeful wishing that the F-26Bs could be F-16s one day

Did you convert the scenario into a multiplayer one, or has it been multiplayer from the start?
It's been multiplayer from the start
all I've made is campaigns

If you feel comfortable with it, can you zip up your multiplayer campaign and PM it to me? I wanna take it apart
sure, if you want to "steal" it go ahead because I did literally nothing but add the spawns into the map lol
how would I go about zipping up a mission tho?

Are you getting that error when you try to upload it to the workshop, or when you try to test it?
upload to workshop
but, so I went into the scenario info and set the auto player count back to being enabled and now it seems it wants to let me upload

if I set it to auto balance, does it make it so for every 1 person on blue team, 1 has to be on red?
No. It adds a player slot for each MP spawn, as far as it can
Either you need to have the box ticked, or you need to move the sliders/enter numbers

also, can you tell me what "Hull Number" is for the ships?
It's the giant number painted on the deck and tower
It appears in the comm menu unless you give them a name

@Sypwn figured out the issue with obj completion we had the other night for the last obj- the global value wasn't specified for like, 4/6 of the enemy  targets, so they weren't incrementing it up high enough to complete.   also, is there a way to hide all the HUD when in the editor to take clean screenshots?
iirc there is a camera tool you can use when testing the scenario, i *think* its insert or something to access it but idr
so i just have to launch the mission and actually be in game. balls

Why would they pick up troops?

I don’t know

what directory is that in? im seeing one in the main top level folder... but it hasn't been updated since like 2 months agoi
nvm found the current version
just getting stuck at 100% load bar.

Could you start the game, try to launch the mission, then quit once it gets stuck and post that log? It’s not close to me which of the errors in that log is the one that’s tripping you up
@Skumby here's what i got
Though it’s super weird that it seems to be going back to the start-up carrier bridge view afterwards

What map is the mission using? One of your own creation?
im trying to make a fly to objective and i noticed this radius properties right here. is there any way to visualize the size of it?
Can't remember if that's the one time you get a circle around it or not

I know it happens for one of them

@Skumby any thoughts as to why it would be trying to return to carrier? this is the second mission save that ive had this happen on. the first time, i thought it was maybe because of paths or triggers that conflicted with AI unit behavior settings or something... it's not the map being updated without being repacked. i know the map isn't inherently broken because I have 2 other missions that I have started on either side of this particular save that still both work.
More missions where Overlord is survival condition?
not in this one. but i did get my overlord survival condition one to work

“Why it would be trying to return to carrier” what do you mean?

“Why it would be trying to return to carrier” what do you mean?
Good. My work here is done
"Though it’s super weird that it seems to be going back to the start-up carrier bridge view afterwards"

Do you see that scene, or does it just stay on the loading screen until you murder it?
just stuck on loading. bar is 100%
If you want, I can take a look at it tomorrow. Zip up the mission folder and pm it to me.

hmm... anybody have any experience with AI bomber? trying to have it fly a path, then when close, trigger it to try to use the 'bomb waypoint' function. it gets within the waypoint trigger proximity, and then just kinda wigs out and flies off in some random direction while throttling up and down and S-curving until it eventually just crashes into the ground
Have you tried trying it to start it’s bombing earlier?
It might be trying to get into a position to start its run, but the start point is behind our inside it our something

Editor Question: Assault Carriers, what armaments do they have, and what does HULL NUMBER mean?
Hull number is just the number thats written on the boat, its got two ESSM launchers and one CIWS
Its possibly got two different radars, so it might be capable of using both launchers at the same time

Alternate spawn weight, if all left at 100. Game will RNG it?
Yup, they'll all have the same weight, the same equal chance of being picked
Any existing mods for more statics and units?

Any existing mods for more statics and units?
None that allow you to create missions to put on the workshop
(I hope)

So to make someone move you need event more that anything else, (with path and units ofc)   But how to make arty shoot waypoint? Cant find any event for it
And default waypoint do fug all
Ah i see. o was choosing unitgroup

why my mission dont start?
because something's wrong
and what is?

and how can i do that?
on units?
Yes

What exactly does the "StayInRadius" Behavior make ground units do?
for infantery it make them randomly run in a 64m radius
good for helo mission

And what about tanks? Similar concept?
i don t think it work for anything else than inf
How can I make a mission a multiplayer one?

How can I make a mission a multiplayer one?
been tryna learn how to use the editor
You cannot create standalone multiplayer missions, only multiplayer campaigns. Create a campaign and there is a check box to make it multiplayer.

Can I transfer an already existing mission to a campaign?
You can by editing the .vts file.
another thing I'm tryina upload to steam, but I get an error message saying that there's no player spawn But there is one and I can't add any more because there already is a player spawn bro what 🗿

? i have evrything done. just trying to rename it
campaign or mission?
If it's a mission I think you need to go in the editor itself, find the tab says scenario info and change the name

I really can't find anything to help sorry Can't you just switch it in the campaign menu?
On another note I'm having problems setting up spawn points in a MP campaign im tryna do I just get soft locked in the loading screen with the map What player spawn points should I add? I've already got a bunch of MP ones, but there's also the regular "player" spawn, which I thought was for SP only
another question (jesus this is complicated) I've got an error message "There are no player slots in the Scenario Info Window"
But nowhere in there can I chose the slots Where can I set them up?

That would be a bug if true. Are you on the public_testing branch?
Yup
Sure it's a bug? Cause when it was at 0 I couldn't spawn in and when it's at the maximum the player slots appear Isn't it what it does?

aaaah ok thanks

What is the range of the enemy MBT?
I'm playing a workshop mission in AH-94. The mission triggers an event once TADS locks to a particular (friendly) unit. I'm wondering how this is achieved. Haven't been in mission editor for a while but had a look just now and noticed a lot of new vehicle control conditionals that can be tested. But I can't see anything that behaves as above - fires when a unit is locked on by TADS. Anybody know how it is done?  Not mission editor I know, but does helicopter have a night vision setting?  I can't see a button on the dash for it!
Vehicle Controls conditions do not work in multiplayer. However, there is a condition to check if a player unit is locking another specific unit using a specific sensor.

Also, you can always activate NVG by clicking your forehead

how about if someone joins in mid game? That would increase the value by 1 Would that break anything?
That I wouldn't mind
thanks a lot man

is that plane or helicopter you want to check on take off?
I've had another idea

Hey guys!  I've setup a VTOL competitive league! (No, not just "another one", or "just a tournament"). We are setting up a full season with rankings, weekly matches, and a season ending tournament in November.  With this massive undertaking, we as a community need some balanced PVP mission.  Itt doesn't need to be immediately done.  As of now, our main Mission is going to be the PVP strike mission variants(with additions to the map pool gradually coming).  Honestly if someone can just Copy/Paste that entire map and programming and JUST add a hard time limit of 1hr 15 mins, then the league will be set.    If it can't be copy/pasted or just edited simply, then an entire map with EXTREMELY similar layout would be much loved.    Let me know if anyone is interested in joining as a player, or joining up as a map/mission consultant.

Id like to see some of the asymmetric pvp go into that league. I cant remember who it was that made it though. @Strikeeaglechase If i remember you were there during the asymetric pvp match yea? when I was flying a helo and i think you and the map maker were flying low tech
@Browning made that map.
Thank you i couldnt remember. I'd love to see something like that for a tourny

I'm in now way an expert in this stuff.  :). I did look at the map and misson editor IN GAME, didnt find a way to do it there, scanned thru the local files on my PC for the map to add to the editor folders but couldnt find it, and the official map isn't posted by BahamutoD that I could see.  So I got stuck in the mud on this.  Perhaps BahamutoD can simply add the premade map to the workshop and we just DL it from there?  Idk how to proceed.  :)
Missions on the workshop are in a special compiled format that cannot be edited. Only the original creator has access to the files needed to edit a mission. EDIT: Without breaking EULA and the trust of mission creators everywhere.
Noice.  Idk why I read @Strikeeaglechase as "Strike Eagle Cheese", but he's part of the league and will surely put some effort towards this project once it gets underway, so we should be set.

the hard way of not breaking steams encryption?
It's not steam encryption

Could someone link some form of tutorial for PvP missions? Instead of just dropping 86 questions in chat that get answered in 2 seconds
For context: I wanna make a pvp mission where you need to do a couple of objectives to win
and also get kills at the end

how can i make it so that the bots only fire on incomming armament instead of atacking players? i'm trying to make a multiplayer mission for me and my friends so we can practise fighting the NFP carrier
Use the ignore target unit event action
(Tell the carrier to ignore the mp spawns)

okay, if i understand correctly i need to go to the event tab and make an event that if a player get's detected he/she get's ignored, right?
i'm pretty new to vtol's editor
You can do it right from the start

so, i've tried setting all my allied unit's to non target for the bot's but they will still shoot me if i come close. am i doing something wrong?
Other way around
Or maybe not

What's in the non-targets "7 selected"?
all of those that are checked are player controlled
Just going to check it myself

is there any way to add fire effects to buildings?
Nope
the only way ive found is to use one of those crashed kestrel props and shoved them into the houses lmao

But all the hesco walls and similar? Go wild
ahhhh okay wonderful then
what about the kestrels

should i just leave the behavior as is?
All the default behaviour stuff is overridden by any event actions the unit receives
very nice.

How did you do this*?
put a crashed kestrel prop on the floor or the same level as whatever it is you want the fire to come out of  hold middleclick and drag it into an object **without letting go of middleclick, press spacebar**  voila
holy shit.

Is there a way to snap platforms together so there is no height difference? . If I do it currently I get a slight increase in height for every platform.
If you start at the high end, you might be able to set the altitude so that the rest are the same
Might also try Bishop's middle click drag trick ^

OK appreciate the responses - never tried file editing, and wouldn't know what to tweak etc - but do you start by opening the mission file in a text editor? - if this is too big a subject to get into - no worries at all - please ignore the question 👍
I can absolutely show you
It's really easy, it's a raw text file that uses the KSP file save format

OK really appreciate it and would be interested to learn. Where do I start - going to bed soon but will try to view the mission file tomorrow on a break. Do I need to download a specific file reader for the KSP file save format?
Nope
just any text editor will work

If i spawn in some bombers on a path, is there a way to keep their speed the same the whole time?
seems like they keep speeding off even after i set in an event their initial speed to slow
I think it depends what action you give them. If they are just flying to a nav point they should follow their set nav speed.

@Sypwn Did you remove the 145s from the delta internal bays?
yeah
Ah lol

@Sypwn so delta is going to be literally just bombs and guns?
F-45As still have wing pylons
they also still have their aim-9s

So.... self defense and the entire principle of multirole out the window?
if the F45 was crippled like that in the main game, i would understand your frustration. but i think this makes dynlib more fun and team based
I disagree

if we had 4 fully capapble F45 noone would ever play the other aircraft, becausewhy should you? you can just do everything with it at once. no need for dedicated cap and a2g players.
I mean if he does end up making jaidenskymode that will probably end up being a 45 will a2g and a2a
I would still play the 26 because the 26 is fun! I play dynlib to have a good time, not do actual coop, because coop is not happening in a pub lobby, no matter how hard you try

how do I import a standalone mission into a mp campaign?
when I paste the mission file into the campaign and try to upload it just says no player spawn
well you have to add player spawns to a mp mission..

do I need to place a spawn everywhere I want players to spawn?
Yes?
it only lets me make 1 player spawn

Can we get a slash macro that explains about MP campaigns and how to convert to one?
Shadow is the one to talk to about that
But he’s mentioned he dosnt want to bloat it too much

Is it possible for team B in MP missons to have a fully working AWACs? I can't get mine to do picture/bogey dope callouts.
@Skumby good morning my man i tried to launch my mission again, and while it did work, it didnt display in vr. meaning i couldnt do shit with it. what am i to do?
Does it display on the monitor? Does anything appear in your headset? Do you see the helmet scene, or the map load scene, or the team scene or the slot selection scene?

Damnit, I am trying to get an enemy group (Alpha) to Spawn as a group randomly in one place or another. But the Spawn Index doesn't let me change it.  Doesn't seem to allow me to edit "idx" but only if this has been placed within a FIRE CONDITIONAL ACTION. Is there a better way to do this?
Alt spawns sound like what you want
You don't need to use a conditional action to get them to work

ok so just spawn then and let the weight figure it out, so long as they're in a group they'll be together?
So all the members of the group will use the same alt spawn index
ohh i seee....

Can you not put two prox triggers, one on each of spawn 1 and 2, that spawns a bunker on 1 or 2 if it sees members of alpha nearby?
That's a clever idea
does proxy only affect spawned units?

does proxy only affect spawned units?
Yup, non-spawned units don't exist. Or shouldn't exist. If unalive people trigger a trigger, that's a bug
You'll have a little more work testing to see if the bunker's dead, as now there'll be two bunkers that you'll have to check, but at least you'll have your units and bunker spawning together

Global variable tracking the state of...reinforcement?
phases
so to speak

but its a pain to find out how many are dead and use that number to spawn X amount? I thought you can't compare values.
I figured. fek
Or rather it'd be several, in a conditional action

How do you get to the team selection if it doesn't show on the HMD? Does it show the first few scenes on the HMD then stop?
it literally just opens on either scene, on my monitor. nothing on the HMD other than the virtual desktop thing
You using virtual desktop, or link/airlink?

You using virtual desktop, or link/airlink?
im not sure what it's called but its just the regular oculus link via cable
i didn't install any third party apps

Are you using oculus mode or the default SteamVR?
default steamvr
i use oculus link to make it a PCVR headset and then all of my games run with steamvr

And you're starting SteamVR before starting VTOL VR?
nope, launches automatically right before the game does
Try starting SteamVR before starting VTOL VR. Does the game appear in your headset before you enter the mission editor? Does it show "Mission Editor uses your monitor" when you're in the editor?

Try starting SteamVR before starting VTOL VR. Does the game appear in your headset before you enter the mission editor? Does it show "Mission Editor uses your monitor" when you're in the editor?
will do the game does appear in my headset before i launch the mission editor and it does give me the text yeah
I honestly don't know. I've not heard of anyone having issues like this. Most people have trouble right from the start, not from it breaking half way through

Is it a multiplayer mission?
yes
two seater heli type thing

if i have this set for the entire group, do they attack anything close by that is considered hostile or do they focus on the player?
They'll attack anything
You can set priority targets if you want them to focus on something

is there any way to start this event on objective start?
the enemies do not spawn until the 2nd objective starts
You might want to increase the Count too, otherwise it'll be the saddest carpet bombing ever

so if i begin the objective i can set the event to trigger and the enemies will begin the attack on the selected targets?
Should do, yeah
You'll want to make sure the Enabled check box is not checked in the CarpetbombEvent, so it doesn't activate itself until you trigger it

wait so if the event already is set to begin with objective two, what do i do with all the stats here?
Whatever you want
It's all entirely irrelevent

The Backstop are SARH or ARM?
pretty sure they're SARH
what would be their usage over BSM?

what would be their usage over BSM?
I'm not really familiar with Allied ground and stationary units :/
The backstop are Enemy tho AFAIK.

@Sypwn Any chance you could take a look at a campaign and figure out why its causing a black screen?
Its an invalid character in file path but I don't see any invalid characters anywhere
That sounds familiar

is it possible to make the multiplayer spawns on a carrier work if the carrier is moving? it seems like the fleets of ships are typically in motion, but I'm wondering about how you'd go about setting up spawns for a multiplayer carrier-op mission where you start on the carrier. strikes me that you'd get left behind and spawn in the air if you didn't spawn in like, instantly all together
You attach the spawns to the carrier and they will move with it.
I'm getting a screenshot...

So, had converted my map from SP to MP, and there was a glitch where the AH-94 could not requip the GAU, probably from restricted weapon selection. How do I fix this? I assume I need to edit the VTC or VTS file
The patch notes for the latest public testing update addressed that I think >     - Fixed: Could not rearm when a singleplayer mission with forced equips is converted to multiplayer
But I've also seen apparently rearming is janky right now either way?

But I've also seen apparently rearming is janky right now either way?
Oh? So I don't need to do anything? Hmmm
Do you know of a way to properly form the VTC and VTS files? I suspect it has to do with any of these lines.

Howdy peeps. If I set a carrier and some cruisers as a group, and then tell the carrier to follow a path, will the other ships follow? Also, I want to create an objective where the player has to deliver troops to a secret base in some mountains. If they are spotted, I have it set up so there is a trigger if the player is detected. What I want to know, is if there is a way to disable that trigger after the objective of dropping off troops has been completed successfully without be spotted. I know you can cancel an objective, but can you cancel triggers on objective completion?

> Howdy peeps. If I set a carrier and some cruisers as a group, and then tell the carrier to follow a path, will the other ships follow? You have to order **the group** to follow the path for them to move in formation.

That you! I assume I need a trigger to get the group to move since I can't select groups to issue orders.

Yes, or you can use the start actions from one of your objectives.

Okay. What would be the best method to get rid of the detection trigger? I am very confused looking at sequences. 😦
I'm away from my computer right now, but you want to create a **completed action** in the objective, to **stop** the conditional event you created.
Thank you!

Is there a way of disabling specific weapons on the enemy ships by adding lines to the   .vts file? Want enemy carrier to have AA guns but no active Sam's.
I don't believe thats possible
You can specifically destroy those weapons with trigger actions, but they will appear on fire. Maybe you can come up with an explanation such as a preemptive attack.

Thanks for the responses guys. Destroying them with a trigger would help. Also to save testing do you know if a carrier / gunship would attack a ground target with on guns  - specifically a storage tent? Or will they only fire on aircraft.
No idea, never tested.
OK no worries - all to do with a bit of a different mission approach I'm trying. 👍

CIWS might be able to target ground units????? Im not sure,  I kind of doubt that
Geez it only takes like 2 mins to test. Of the allied ships, only the cruiser's main gun will fire at a ~~ground target~~ tank.
Id have to touch the mission editor tho

Were they within 5km of the ground targets?
If you're scared of the mission editor, then why are you in #mission_editor
Because I can answer some of the mission editor questions kek

Was the testing target within 2km? Im *guessing* it requires a radar lock to fire, but it can *see* tanks
actually no it can't see tanks, but it can see infantry/tents
The target is a tank barely visible near the top center of the screenshot.

Then what, tents? Landed aircraft?
Id try infantry, or tent's
or both

I need some help. I made a mission and I can't upload it. Anyone know what's going on?
upload your log
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

is that a multiplayer mission/campaign?
nope

Is Unity's cdp really required to upload files to steam workshop?
No idea but its consistant with other workshop errors iv seen
Lemme see if I can find a dependency on it

can I do something to fix it?
(cant paste a link because it's got quotes in the search)
Some people say to just try again later. Some people mention problems with using family sharing. Some people say the files they are trying to upload are too big.

Does the mission have really large briefing pictures or lots of background music or something?
it got some 8 custom voicelines and a few fotos
As for the DNS error, if you are the one responsible for your internet connection and you don't have any custom networking hardware (3rd party gaming router, Pihole, etc) then you can call your ISP for support

How do I put 'notes' into the. Vts file please? Putting a lot of static objects in and wanted to put a note/name in next to an object ID so I know which are for what area  on the map. Do I have to put it inside a certain type of bracket?
Not sure if it's possible without the comments getting wiped the next time you save it from in the editor.
No worries - thanks anyway. Will have to find a pen a paper 😂

Is it possible (in theory) to make a mission that randomly generates objectives and spawns enemies (as in a mission generator)?
through mods yeah, but in base game the closest thing you can do is make a bunch of objectives yourself and have them randomly activate
missions like Killbox and Dynamic Lib do this

What's the bare, and I mean *bare* minimum cash needed for a fighter jet?
Like, 1-2 missiles, half a tank of gas *maybe*, and a gun.

quick question, are triggered events permanent on do the only fire once? I would like to change a global value based on kills/deaths and was wondering if the event would stop after one successful trigger
They are limited to a single firing. We mission creators have been asking Baha for loopable triggers for a while.

so is there a way to use the score system to trigger events? Team A gets 100 points and they win kind of thing?

Best workaround is to create an event sequence with a node for each death, up to whatever limit your sanity allows. It's easier to copy-paste nodes with Notepad++, but that's a whole other can of worms.
ok cool. Thanks for your help Sypwn

really? can't seem to find it
Is the mission part of a MP campaign?
yes its a MP score keeper. I'm attempting a hide and seek map 2x F45 vs 10x FA26B I have a timer, but I wanted to use a scoring system to punish seeker deaths 10 for a kill -5 for a death. I can add it to the score system, but I couldn't find a trigger to pop at a certain score

There's a conditional node type "MP Stats" or something like that. If what you need is not in there, then I can't help.

Does anyone want to test out my new mission? Looking for feedback. Med/Hard difficulty

Nevermind, got it
is it made for solo or MP?

Solo for now
ill check it out later tonight

I'm getting into making missions, any tips?
make sure travel times make sense
don't make the helicopter fly farther than 20nm

One time I had a 53 nm flight. We died. A lot.  But also, do you have to manually add players? Cause right now I have a player spawn on an aircraft carrier, do I have to add more or can they all spawn on the carrier? I only have 1 player spawn identified right now.
iirc you have to put a spawn for every slot you want
Ok, thanks!

Wait are stand alone missions mp?
I cannot add another player spawn
yeah thats one of the biggest things I wanted to stay away from, i'm a heli gunner and sometimes I have to fly solo, I know the pain of flying for 25nm and getting shot down by a slam truck

@AtrociousAmbition/Mr. Charisma would editor tips be too subjective for the wiki?
I wouldn't stop you from making a blog post for it, at least.
I'd need a blog for that

Enemy Rocket Artillery, and MPA-155. What are their maximum ranges in KM?
And before anyone says "2-8KM" to the Rocket Artillery, that's if they visually acquire, but if they acquired a target indirectly how far could they launch from. Nevermind accuracy since that can apparently be cheated.
About 25km I think

What happens if not everybody wants to do the same thing?
Each sector has a number of events that result in the map being threatened by enemies every time the player does something
The choice comes down to a single AV-42 who selects an option

Oh, so one holds power?
Hah! I like it.
The map is built for 6 AH-94's and 1 AV42

Seems interesting! I really wanna see how this unfolds as a campaign! How many missions are there?
Sectors are between 7k to 20k apart, so travel distances will be optimized to allow plenty of action inbetween
It's one mission, not a campaign

Cool! So what's the main priority so far?
Just filling out sectors will enemies, connecting it all. and of course balance testing this
Nice, what about the mission, what's it about?

I plan to branch out 3 difficulty modes, Easy for a...mostly no-failiure conditions so casual players can throw their vehicles at the problem. Normal, as intended, and hard, well...I try to kill you >:)
The mission is about taking back an costal city occupied by [Insert opposing force here] , modeled after Toronto, Canada.

@Sypwn Using the Action Fire on Waypoint Radius. Will it do this continuously? I set Allow Reload on all my rocket artillery's
Doesn't it have a parameter for number of volleys/salvos or something?
well I want it to keep shooting until they're destroyed.

well I want it to keep shooting until they're destroyed.
Then make it a very large number

Is their default behaviour set to follow a path or parked until triggered?
Default is navigate path
Only difference between them is hull number

And they are near the path to be able to travel it? Do you have a screenshot of the properties and path?
Actually thats the issue
thank you

Was trying to do a target practice type training map with a bunch of different target groups/regions with different types of ground targets/threats that would respawn after you killed them all in a given area.  example-  'Alpha' group of enemy tanks is a tank column.. say like 10 vehicles that spawn immediately, follow a path that loops.  an Event is set that when numalive of 'Alpha' = 0, then it would force spawn unit group 'Alpha'  i tried that, but i guess the 'spawn' function only spawns units that have not ever been alive, rather than spawning units that were once alive and now dead... so...  anybody got any other ideas that don't require me to just manually add a TON of units in individual, finite waves to spawn one after another?
how do I have multiple types of aircraft and choose where they spawn. I only have access to 1 player spawn so do I just put aircraft spawns?
I know I can add alt spawns but I cant change their squad per alt spawn

@illumi i think i had the same confusion- you're probably trying to do a single mission, right?  like, instead of creating a 'campaign'?  the 'mission' or whatever that's sort of a stand-alone one-shot deal doesn't work quite the same... no reason to really use it as far as i can tell

build your thing as a 'campaign' so that you can make it multiplayer if you want. then you can place as many 'Player Spawn' items as you want instead of just one... and you can set which vehicle each one is.
when you make a 'Campaign' instead of a little one-shot mission, you can make missions inside the campaign, and they can support numerous player spawns for each team. each spawn can then be set to a specific vehicle and squad.

what are you guys' favorite text-to-speech tools for making audio clips for missions?
There a way to start the mission without going into vr just to see if certain things work?
@Pjork so, you can do testing from in the editor, but you WILL have to put your headset on for like just a second.

Hey, quick question: I am making my first mission but when I attempt to upload for multiplayer testing it gives me a warning that reads ‘the game doesn’t have any fail safes for if it loads an object it doesn’t know and it softlockes peoples games. This will Probably be fixed in an update’. What does this mean? Any help would be great.
seems like its just a heads up that the game is a bit buggy in its current state
as far as i know this is normal

Hey, if I want to have a switch for setting the "engage enemies" status of units, triggered by for example the player locking a bunker with the tgp to activate it, and locking another to deactivate it, how exactly will this affect already launched missiles if the unit being toggled is for example a Missile cruiser?
It won't affect missiles at all, and there is no way to control them with triggers.
Oh wait, missiles require radar lock

how do i get smoke?
a way to make a mission guaranteed last forever is to have one required destroy objective with an invincible unit?
i want any of 12 players to be able to trigger an event by locking on to a specific unit. because i want 10+ of those trigger units, i would like to know if there is a way to do it without having it look like this

Is there any intention of including AWACS in the Dynamic Liberation missions?
I may try and make it a gamemode, but I have no idea how to make missions
I can make a quick mock-up

im unable to add a target for them to board, will they go to the closest allied aircraft without one selected?
A) The only AWACS available in the game is an E-3 Sentry, which cannot be launched from a carrier. If an E-2 Hawkeye or equivalent carrier capable AWACS was made available, I would consider it. B) Personally I find the AWACS callouts quite annoying, especially when I'm in an F-45 with full situational awareness, and AFAIK there is no way to mute them without muting all team comms.  Voice acting is coming soon™️ which may include some degree of reinforcement callouts. Until then, it should be the role of Alpha to call out new threats.
you can independently control comms for AI and other team members

is this a standalone mission?
You probably created a singleplayer mission. To create multiple player spawns, the mission has to be inside a multiplayer campaign. To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign 2. Import your mission into the campaign 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer.
yes

any chance someone could help me with this?
i do not know
I've never used troop pickup, and I'm not near pc right now.

and does anybody know if completion rewards go to everyone or the person who completed the objective?
also do budgets actually do anything? the cost went over-budget, but it didnt restrict it at all
Maybe not in multiplayer. I don't know of anyone else that uses them.

is there a way to make enemy units respawn? Ik you can force them to spawn, force them to spawn alternate places, but does any of those make them respawn?
how do you get a carrier group to stay together and follow a path?
No. You have to fake it by making multiple copies of the unit.

Put them all in the same group, then use a UnitGroup trigger action to command them to move.

Does this happen to be allied cruisers against enemy GAV-25?
and asf 30's
- AI are really good at beaming/notching and using CM - Allied cruiser missiles appear to have a pretty small splash zone - GAV-25s can take A LOT of damage Added up, it can take 8+ cruiser missiles to take down a single GAV-25

@Sypwn got a link to some documentation of how to edit the files in notepad for that purpose? I'm plenty comfortable messing around with text for stuff like that as long as I know the notation or whatever
Use Notepad++. Beyond, that, it's all in english, and the syntax is relatively self-explanatory. I feel like "if you need a guide, you shouldn't be doing it". Just make a backup of your mission, then start messing around. You can ping me with specific questions. Chase also wrote some JS code to convert the VTS to JSON, or something like that.
As for how to convert a mission between SP and MP: Make a SP campaign and create a blank mission with only a player spawn Make a MP campaign and create a blank mission with only a player spawn Compare the two VTS files to see what's different. That shows you what you need to change to convert between the two.

how does spawning on the carrier work? do I have to put down mp spawns and parent them to the carrier or something?
nvm i gotit
@Sypwn or anybody else really... what's the difference between these values? i assume the 'initial delay' is only relevant if you have the 'Begin Immediately' box checked... right?  so if I want a timed event to start 25 seconds after the completion of an objective, I can put that as an action in the complete objective section... and the way I have this set would do that?

`Initial delay` effectively adds that delay to ALL nodes in that timed group
so regardless of when the whole group is triggered to start, it's just a buffer. so doesn't matter if it starts immediately or not

Where do I put the feature requests?
Because I wanted to modify the loading screen graphic and it...didn't turn out the way I had hoped ;p
Also, apparently in testing, when you set Invincible when launched from Editor, the Invincibility flag only applies to the first vehicle. Not subsequent respawns.

I was told height.png was the one to edit. I guess that's wrong?
I thought it was one of the two, not sure
As I understand, preview is only shown in the editor thumbnail and thats all?

As I understand, preview is only shown in the editor thumbnail and thats all?
I see that you've had this discussion with RED already
Either way it shouldn't have changed the map mesh itself even if you modified heat.png unless you regenerated the heightmaps

Ah but in game the terrain was fine?
Yep terrain was fine
Interesting

any tricks to get an unit to takeoff?
iv set a taxi path to the runway, and a proximity trigger to comand overlord to take off, it plays the radio audio when the trigger is set but it doesnt takeoff
Don't taxi them to the runway. Let them do that themselves.

Is the airbase properly configured and owned by that team?
in the Bases tab
yes

Could someone help with this?
I can't figure out why they wont follow the path
I've also tried rail path

Damn is so hard to get a mission to work properly.. Am i too dumb? Lol
Lots of trial and error
Keep forgeting to link the correct triggers to the right things and timing argh...

is there a way i can set sams and mad4 not to attack a specific target?

There's an action to "set non-target", but it gets weird with stationary SAM sites

Hey, I'm trying to have some infantry advance on a city, but when I drew a path they all ended up lining up in a big conga line. If I want them to all just walk forward do I need to draw a path for them all individually?
When using a path, they will walk to the path then follow it exactly.  If you want them to walk toward the city independently, you should instead create a waypoint and tell them to walk to it. If you want them to instead move along the path but in a different formation, make them all members of a group, then (using an action) tell the entire group to follow the path.
which behavior makes them all walk towards a waypoint?

which behavior makes them all walk towards a waypoint?
Telling each one individually to walk to the waypoint
either as an action ~~or by default behavor~~ EDIT: didn't realize infantry don't have a Move To Waypoint behavior...

Or is it through events?
Actions must be created either by an event, or though an objective
Got it, thank you!

Also, are allied forces way stronger than enemy forces? When I did a test run the allies killed all the enemies pretty quickly
I'm not sure, sorry. I haven't really worked with allied units much.
Ok, thanks for the help!

why do my KC-49 tanker and UARV refueling drones not show up when I go ingame? do they need an E-4 AWACS?
define "not show up"
they're not in the comms menu, so I cant communicate to them to request aerial refueling

are they not supposed to-?
I've never done aerial refueling tbh but I assumed thats how its done
I've never used em :/

do you know what speed the auto nav is set to? when I set it to 250 it flies at like mach 0.8-0.9 so it's definitely not knots
Most units within the editor are metric, the speed is in m/s
that would explain why its traveling at nearly the speed of sound instead of 260 knots...

when making aerial units, is there an easy way to make them fly in formation? or do I need to make a separate path for each unit?
Put them all in a group, then, using an event action, tell the entire UnitGroup to move somewhere
If you tell each plane to go somewhere individually, they will do so independently. But if you tell the group to move using a UnitGroup action, they will do so in formation.

even if its a path?
yes
Found 5 people playing my first map in the server browser

Does Objective Clear action not work in multiplayer?
you mean cancel?
yes

🤔 You sure about that?
It usually writes the reason the objective can't be cancel to player.log if you try
Oh ok... Hmmmmm

What does the log say?
Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state None! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state None! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state None! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed!
but with objectives like Pick up and Drop off which I need to complete, this won't help me

Are you canceling the objective at the same moment it's being completed?
nope, after a "PHASE" is completed
Can I cancel it upon completion?

Can I cancel it upon completion?
Then that could be a bug. I can dig into it tomorrow.
Don't try.

now how do i upload it then?
with the upload button
didn't work

Did you change any of the mission files manually?
You could also try changing it directly in the workshop
Or delete the workshop entry if you don't care about the stats

did you rename the ~~mission~~ campaign files directly or edit them with notepad?
I'm trying to change the campaign name
not the individual mission

in the vts file for a mission, can you increase the number of targets (to destroy) past 50? idk if it actually works
Yes
Also limit?

like i have more targets than i can set as minimum required so if i edit the vts file itll increase minimum needed?
You could just use a conditional objective UnitList [Units] Number Alive Is 0 The only downside is the OBJ screen loses the unit counter, but you may consider that an acceptable loss.
Ok thanks

Is there anywhere that states how much damage each weapon does and how much health things have?  I have an allied cruiser I want to travel across a path. I want to endanger it with enemies that players have to take out before too much damage is done, but I don't want to kill this cruise too easily, or by chance.  Obviously putting a bunch of infantry isn't really going to kill it, so I need something dangerous, but not deadly. Thoughts?
For weapon stats I created this   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLWW-bbyfJEuQnnMmhSoCq39m3Ge5fxL11G_qbVDd88/edit  Iv been wanting to create stats for AI units for a while but it’s a lot more complex
Ah well if this isn't AI, that doesn't help me unfortunately.

How do I make a mission where you have the option of going on team B?
I'd like to setup something where you're going against "Allied" units
make a multiplayer mission, and ad player slots for team b

And how do I make a mp mission? I only see options for standalone, campaign, and steam workshop
I assumed it was an option somewhere for standalone but can't find it
you need to make a campaign, when creating it there will be an option to make it multiplayer

Couldn't seem to find what railpath does online, could someone please explain it? 😅
The same thing as Path. It's leftover from some old mechanics iirc
Ah okay, thank you!

when making a mission how do i ge tthe ground units to move? i have a path n have them set to follow it currently
Did you set behavior to path, and set the default path?
for the tank i set the path to the path i created just a straight linear line

Did you set behavior to path, and set the default path?

You need to set Behavior to Path (or maybe Follow Path), and you have to set the Default Path to the path you created. Have you done both of these?

@Sypwn are you able to despawn/deactivate ground radars/units after an obj is completed?
Deactivate, yes. "Engage enemies" can be toggled for most units. Definitely the MAD-4 at least.  Despawn, no
What I'm saying is that it's sorta possible using some trickery, as long as it doesn't involve destroying units.

id figure a mountain range ordeal?
But with all AH-94s, as you suggested. Makes more sense
Ask the PvP players what they think

@Temperz87 @Kazper @Strikeeaglechase @Jaidensky   (im missing some but these are the ones i know)  For an Ah-94 domination game mode would you guys prefer a mountain range, plains, valley, or something else?
i feel special thank you for involving me i would prefer a mountain range personally, but i dont do much heli flying
As in AH-94 a2a combat?

play and adjust unit count and posistion accordingly
yep

and SAMs et al. just kind of go as much as feels right, right?
some sams have their counterparts on both teams, i would recommend going to PT as it will be more balanced since currently you have more SAM options
some things to note:

how do I make tunnels??
you can't
the akutan map is special

can you manually edit anythings position?
you put a waypoint where you want the object to be, then you go into the .vts and copy the waypoint's coords and paste it as the object's coords
A) Don't use Windows Notepad to edit the .vts, or else it will screw up the line endings. Use Notepad++ or another more advanced text editor. B) After making .vts changes outside the game, you must completely quit out of VTOL to reload your changes into the game.

do I also need to change lastValidPlacement, or only globalPosition?
The helicarrier isn't real... or possible
dunno, try both

I am introducing myself to the editors. I started working on a campaign. I would like for the second mission to get many assets back as they were set up in the first mission. Positions of radars, SAM, docks, bunkers, etc I don‘t see a button to duplicate a mission. How can I do that?

hey all, If this is off topic let me know where to put it. I extracted and ported the Operation: Desert Cobra campaign to the F-45 and have been playing through it to test it. I have no desire to take credit for it as all I did was change 2-3 values but I think it's a cool demonstration of how differently things play out in a 5th Gen plane vs a 4th Gen plane.

Well ask Baha he made the campaign

yo Sypwn, you said last night about disabling aircraft carrier catapults by having bots get on the catapult, then get destroyed?  How would I do that? Taxi event, then takeoff? Can I make them go to specific catapults since I only want to disable some?
I wouldn't seriously use that method in a mission
But no, you can't pick catapults. You have to rely on the AI using the same catapults in each run

Why only disable a couple catapults?
side catapults will launch aircraft into a mountainside
Oh

I don't remember where exactly or if it was a mod but can you place down arrestor cables in the editor?
that would be CSA
it's a mod

thats awesome!!! is it mp also ?
I guess I could make MP, I haven't been messing with VTOL VR for long but I assume it's just another value in the mission file
You can ask baha, I asked about the built in PVP strike mission and he said it was fine, but a campaign might be different I dunno, just gotta ask him

Is it possible to make dynamic campaigns? (like Enemy Engaged)
Depends how you define "dynamic". The events of one mission cannot affect another, if that's what you're referring to.
In Enemy Engaged, it's basically a single session where missions are created depending how the war is going between two factions, dynamically creating missions for CAS/Recon etc etc as needed.

Can I add it later?
or do I need to reupload as a new map?
also how upload the map will update the old one?

Yes, by updating it. On the Steam page, you can also change what pictures, videos, description it shows, and is much more convenient to use than the in-game tools (mostly because it's a markdown editor)

In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Does this campaign only have one mission?
Yea
I have the link to the map in the description of Operation Operation First sight if that's the problem

Did you make any changes by editing the .vts file?
no just by using the mission editor
I just re-subbed to your campaign and it's still broken, so it's not the link.

Are you subscribed to Dender's campaign?
nope
Only way I know of is to use a C# debugger. Can you send me your list of subscribed MP campaigns?

@BahamutoD there is a multiplayer campaign ~~with a bugged mission description~~  that somehow contains a singleplayer mission that prevents the MP campaign list from loading. ```KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[TKey,TValue].get_Item (TKey key) [0x0001e] in <a1e9f114a6e64f4eacb529fc802ec93d>:0    at ConfigNode.GetValue (System.String name) [0x00000] in <a3694e4a02d042939f026ea37ba6344e>:0    at ConfigNode.GetValue[T] (System.String name) [0x00000] in <a3694e4a02d042939f026ea37ba6344e>:0    at VTOLVR.Multiplayer.MPMissionBrowser+BrowserMissionInfo..ctor (VTOLVR.Multiplayer.MPMissionBrowser+BrowserCampaignInfo c, System.String workshopDir, ConfigNode config) [0x000b4] in <a3694e4a02d042939f026ea37ba6344e>:0    at VTOLVR.Multiplayer.MPMissionBrowser+BrowserCampaignInfo+<LoadWsRoutine>d__11.MoveNext () [0x0021a] in <a3694e4a02d042939f026ea37ba6344e>:0    at UnityEngine.SetupCoroutine.InvokeMoveNext (System.Collections.IEnumerator enumerator, System.IntPtr returnValueAddress) [0x00026] in <72b60a3dd8cd4f12a155b761a1af9144>:0 ```
heres mine

I'm only seeing networking errors in that log. Something is blocking web access. Do you have any firewalls or a Pihole or something?
no
i thought there might be a dead link somewhere

Did you create it as a singleplayer mission then convert it to multiplayer? If so, what method did you use?
I didn’t convert it, I’m not at my pc atm but I’ll try that as soon as I get home which is in about 15-30 minutes
these are the settings I've had for a while so I'm not sure why its missing

Question on the Default Behavior for units: I've set units for a triggered airborne spawn with the orders to attack a specific priority target, so it likely wouldn't matter which behavior I set, correct? Otherwise I *could* set it to Path mode but if the target is in motion, there's no guarantee that it would be at any specified point at that moment
Priority target means they will attack that target when they detect it. Until then, they will follow default behavior and attack other units.  Dedicated target means they will ignore their default behavior and go straight for the target you specified.  In both cases, be sure the add priority/dedicated targets actions happen *after* the spawn unit action.
Is there any way to limit radar range on AI aircraft?

spawn them further I guess?
You cannot do it from the editor otherwise, no

You cannot do it from the editor otherwise, no
Dammit okay

Could this be done with a waypoint?
yes
yes

Is it possible to participate in a multiplayer session where we just edit missions?
no
best you can do is screen share

Is there any plan to allow the editing of workshop scenarios & campaigns?
They are specifically made so you cannot steal them
What if you don't steal, you simply improve the mission and re-upload? Just accredit the original author?

What if you don't steal, you simply improve the mission and re-upload? Just accredit the original author?
Cant trust people for that, this is the Internet we're talking about
Ask the author if they are willing to make a variant with those improvements, or if they will send you the mission files so you can.

ey does anyone know how to stop the AI twerking when following a path? I've tried speed and weight changes on the aircraft, which helps a bit, and also changing the path type to linear, bezier, smooth and also all the altitudes on the waypoints are equal, so it's not like they're step climbing or something... The same aircraft fly buttery smooth when just heading to a waypoint or RTB etc, so I'm pretty sure it's the path, or they way AI responds to paths...
twerking?
F-45 too:

anyone knows how to fix infinite loading screen?
infinite ram?
wow

What does repacking the map do?
If create a map, then create a mission with it, then go back and edit the map, your map changes won't show up in the mission until you "repack" it.
isnt that what saving is for?

isnt that what saving is for?
?
like if I save the mission doesnt it do the exact same?

like if I save the mission doesnt it do the exact same?
you can't edit the map from within the mission editor
you have to edit the map in the map editor

if i repack the map on an existing mission (minor changes) does it delete the units?
No
I just tried

Will this make the units drive to the waypoint?
Or do I need to change the behaviour to path for that?
it should

Or do I need to change the behaviour to path for that?
it should
as a wise man once said (who is tragically not in the server anymore) create an event that tells the entire unit group to move to a waypoint

Will they automatically just follow the road?
No. For that you have to make a path that perfectly follows the road
God damit

And let me guess the path cant just automatically stick to the road I have to actually like do that myself?
its just a bunch of points
dont worry about it

@Sypwn are you still up to make the helo competitive mission if i provide you a map?
sure
awesome

We're talking about a mode where two teams are trying to simultaneously hold 2 or 3 points, and can contest any of them at any time, right?
```        ----> Point 1 <----       /                   \ Team A                     Team B  Base                       Base       \                    /        ----> Point 2 <----```
The alternative is where the capture points are in a line and the teams are only contesting a single point at a time. ```Team A <-----> Point 1 <-----> Point 2 <-----> Team B```

Ok, do you want two or three points?
the alternative that would also be more performant is the same layout of the first however it would be 3 points each side
so

iirc you said you can have vics turn on or off equipment based on other things yea?
Each team base is defended by invincible SAMS.
Oh yeah, we can have invincible MAD-4 that turn on and off

well, sorta. Does team A have MAD-4?
the problem with that is they units for each team are not identical
The domination mode you are depicting avoids one of the main roles of the helo which is ground attack

🤔 how do you do your pop up spawns in dyn lib?
they only spawn once
how many do you have set up O.o

its almost like there are x number of straight segments in a path loop, but when the path gets really big, those straight segments, (or intervals?) get really far apart and the wobble gets noticeable. On short paths you can see the elevators wobbling really quickly but since its so fast it doesn't really do anything to the aircrafts flight path.
Note that none of this happens when flying to waypoints
does anybody know if there is any way to force enemy sam sites  to remain with the radar off until an event is triggered, other than making them spawn at that point?

Engage Enemies should control their radar state. I know it does for the MAD-4 at least.
thanks!!

how do i make a mision mutiplayer?
check the MP box and make sure you have MP spawns
It has to be in a multiplayer campaign.

i want to add wingmen and i want then to take off only when i tell then how do i do that?
set them to parked
and use an editor condition to tell your squad to take off

trigger event? I dont remember the name
ohhhhhhhhhh
where is the option to edit the score required to end the game for a multiplayer mission?

where is the option to edit the score required to end the game for a multiplayer mission?
Should be in the Scenario Info dialog
Am I blind or is it just not a option to change

So you would edit the objective instead?
Oh, there isn't a fixed limit? You just use a conditional objective?
I thought that was how missions with point-based objectives worked?

Oh, there isn't a fixed limit? You just use a conditional objective?
I thought that was how missions with point-based objectives worked?
dunno, never made one

I thought that was how missions with point-based objectives worked?

I've never actually made a pvp mission before but I had assumed for stuff like the inbuilt helicopter pvp

I have an objective with a single success condition:  Num (Player Group) Airborne > 0  And no matter what I do I can't seem to get that to return true.  I've taken off, flown to 20k ft, left the area, nothing seems to register that I am airborne.   What am I doing wrong?
I just tested this and you're right, it's bugged. I'll report it to Baha. Until it's fixed, you'll have to check `Is Not Landed` for each player and feed them all into an `OR` block.
is it a player group bug or a "airborn" bug? Could I just do (Player Group) > Is Not > All Landed?

is it a player group bug or a "airborn" bug? Could I just do (Player Group) > Is Not > All Landed?
Oh, forgot that was an option. I'm testing that now.
Nope, that doesn't seem to work either. I suspect UnitGroups are buggy when players are involved.

Hey all, new to VTOL mission editing here. Is there a way to "loop" or "reset" a trigger/objective sequence during a mission, or once they've triggered do they stay triggered for the duration?
Nope, no trigger looping.
Ok cheers. Back to the drawing board for me 😂

Is there a way to switch this radius value between spherical/cylindrical?
I think Unit and UnitGroup use different, one is spherical and the other is cylindrical, but I can't remember which is which.
But I do agree it should be a checkbox

Is UnitList cylindrical? Might be a possible workaround
Oh yeah. I meant to say UnitList. But again I don't remember which is cylindrical and which is spherical.
You'll have to test

Where do you find the maps of the default mp missions?
The one I used came included in the maps folder.
Like, it was already in the map editor

thats why im trying to get it, andy has done the same, do any of you know where to find these?
@Strikeeaglechase
Ill grab it in a bit

does "unit list" only need one unit to execute the logic?
yeah, but in that case, why not just use regular "unit" ?
well i did play the mission and killed one of the SAMs and it completed the mission.

yeah, but in that case, why not just use regular "unit" ?
well i did play the mission and killed one of the SAMs and it completed the mission.
you have Is Not All Alive

What're you trying to achieve?
Kill all 109 guys and thing happens?
yes

Kill all 109 guys and thing happens?
yes
then set Num Alive, then set the value to 0

Just curious, I haven't touched the mission editor at all yet, but how many teams can you have in a mission? Is it a maximum of two, or can you do 3 teams all fighting each other?
max 2
its fairly integral to how the game is setup to support only 2

Do infantry just hop into the av-42c if their in a certain radius or do I have to trigger something?
oh also can you add more stuff to a campaign after its already released on steam?
From the wiki. "Passenger transport is facilitated through objectives and triggers in the Mission Editor"

Not sure how one would go about doing it, but it apparently isn't automatic.

anyone know if the MPA-155 can shoot while moving or do they need to be parked?
If given the command to fire, they will automatically stop.
gotit

how do i convert it to mp?

I cant figure out how to import it ive been saving it but when i open up the import it doesnt show it

How do I disable Team B in a multiplayer scenario I'm making?
just don't make any player spawn points on team b

How do I disable Team B in a multiplayer scenario I'm making?
just don't make any player spawn points on team b
I want it to be a Co-op mission, and set Team B's player count to 0 but there's still an option to join whenever I launch the mission in the editor

Should I just make them ASF-30 or ASF-33's or something?
Try designated, not priority
Priority will only work if the unit actually detects the priority targets, otherwise it will follow its normal behavior

Maybe they are not equipped with them by standard. Have you looked if you van equip them?
They have the guns equipped already and they do use them. They just ignore my priority targets
After careful consideration

@Sypwn so to confirm, let's say I have a game with 5 matches, I can call the game loop from itself and it will work?
and after 5 rounds, I exit it?
"a game with 5 matches" what are you talking about?

and after 5 rounds, I exit it?
"a game with 5 matches" what are you talking about?
Inside a singular mission, there are multiple matches of players PvPing

"a game with 5 matches" what are you talking about?
Inside a singular mission, there are multiple matches of players PvPing
After everything, I wish to clean it up and restart it

can I make it call itself?
**IF** each sequence node has the exact same entry/exit conditions, and only have a single action of calling an identical Conditional Action, then there is a shortcut to duplicate that sequence node any number of times.
via the VTS file

so what was capable of calling itself?
Because entry conditions, exit conditions, and conditional actions are all referenced by ID. So if you duplicate the node, they will all continue to point to the same IDs
By manually editing the vts, you can make a conditional action call itself.

would that work in this case?
It's not very useful because it still has to resolve within a single frame
got it

Is there a way to duplicate a mission if you want to create a similar but slightly different mission?
save-as
Save As

Did a little preliminary checks to see if you can copy/paste events but just to make sure does anyone know for sure if you can or cannot and any possible workarounds if you can't?
@Sypwn
I'm not sure if I understand the question. There are no ways to duplicate events or actions in the editor, but it can be done manually with a text editor if you're careful. There is no way to make a condition loop forever.

Hey all. So I have a fueling tanker follow a path, then at the end of the path, hit a proximity trigger to tell it to land. It flies to the air field, but then just circles like its in a holding pattern. There are no other units in the game other than the player spawn. The whole action is 5 sec timer - take off. When Not landed - set path. Proximity trigger at path end. Unit Land & Set path to none. I have watched it all the way in Dev mode an all seems to work until it arrives at the airfield. Any ideas?
After testing the mission, check your player.log. Specifically, search it for the name/ID of that tanker. Lots of AI behavior is logged there and it may say why it wont land.
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Sup yall. Easy question: Do you need to manually cause enemy planes to take off? Like setting taxi path, holding patterns, take off timers, etc? Or does the game realize there are enemies in a base and does it automatically?
The airbase ATC coordinates takeoff for both players and AI. Unlike most players, AI will actually follow it. This is assuming you set their default behavior to "TakeOff" or command them to take off using an action.
Oh wow that's cool, awesome

What can cause a mission to try to load but never start ?
A few things, many of them have been fixed in the next build in public_testing.
If this is a multiplayer mission, double check that you have at least one MP spawn point, that you have NO "Player" (singleplayer) spawn points, and that your player counts are correct in the mission options.

does anyone know if changing whether the drone carriers engages enemies also affects the drones after they have launched?
whenever i start my mission the aircraft carrier instantly explodes, anyone know how to fix this?
nvm i forgot abt an obj that I put on the enemy team

what's the best way to delay an action?

what's the best way to delay an action?
For my mission after an objective completes I want a unit to wait x amount of time before moving
Either a timed event or an event sequence. If it's just a one-off like that, create a timed event and make it start when the objective completes.

Is there any way to force an allied unit onto the enemy team? Trying to add an enemy tanker to a mission.
currently no
but both teams are able to refuel off the allied tanker

Will enemy AIs automatically approach an allied tanker without shooting it down?
oh i don't think enemy AI can refuel off the tanker
but Team B in mp can

Does anyone happen to know if you can set the default location of the cursor when you load a mission? It's annoying to keep having to pan across my map whenever I do work
Wish it would just remember my last location
zoom out and double click

I don't suppose there's a way to disable the IFF brackets from appearing?  And before anyone says "Set Forced Undetected". That does not affect this.
Unfortunately not by the mission maker.
Not a great screenshot, but what I am referring are the Blue () and Red <>

Wouldn't it also not work due to TGP IFF?
That's not gonna work, lol
I am ok with it working on the TGP for gameplay

Why does it have to be the AV-42 that spots them?
Yeah 42c dosn't have radar at all, only the 94 can radar detect infantry
choppers do, but I suspect they'll be flying circles above the parked av-42 and radar clicking numberous targets that are packed together isnt going to play well on a MDF

Looks like you repacked your map to the wrong map?
can't tell much from that screenshot
what?

What the playercount/aircraft type? Seems like the perfect job for 2 26's running 4 CAGMs each
fair
Oh... yeah I dunno about that tbh lol. You'll have to heavily limit the 45, otherwise a single 45 is going to take out every oil rig lol

I want to simulate a explosion. Is there a way to "CHECK X UNITS IN AREA" and Destroy them?  I know I can do a condition that checks (if ANY from UNIT LIST is in Radius of Waypoint, but, that wouldn't let me filter those that are in range to destroy them)
the most effective way would be to either use an If-else block and check all possible conditions
or check them individually one after the other then blow em up

do the doors on hangers open automatically if there is an aircraft inside?
Yes
ok

Hey guys! Is there a way to simulate runway destruction? I have several gps coordinates placed on a runway. The plan is the player should release gps bombs, and when they hit all the gps points, the objective will complete.
However, i have no idea how to register bombs' hits on the coordinates.
It's there a way?

Is it possible to place destructible buildings like tents *under* the runway? If possible that would be a cleaner method of detecting the impacts
No
file editing?

Anybody know how the backstop launcher compare to the B enemy team options?  e.g. is the missile roughly as good as the enemy team SARH SAMs?
backstop is a BSM-66 equivalent
Rad, thx

Still pretty short range though, no?  Not hucking telephone poles like the MAD-4 after all.
I havn't tested
It's nice to at least have one set of "matched" SAMs for balancing, anyway.

Hey I've made a few missions now that people couldn't join half way through (it would say 'mission failed ' or something when they load into the server). Anyone know why? I can post links if necessary to my missions

Thanks!

Also, any tips/tutorials for the mission editor? I tried looking at the wiki and the pinned posts. I need help with setting a path for my enemy units to follow. I've created a custom path and selected the path in the unit's menu
I'm confused with the options here
"Tango Group Path" is basically a loop around some roads in the city that I want the tanks to follow

> Also, any tips/tutorials for the mission editor?  https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_tips
Change `Behavior` to `Path`, not `Follow`
But otherwise I think you got it

Let's say there are a group of 4 tanks. Should make all of them Behavior: Path? or just the first one and the other 3 can follow each other?
If you want them to follow the path in formation, you need to use an event action to tell the Tango group to follow the path.
There is also an event action to set which formation they use. You'll probably want `Line` formation.

Quick question: How do I enable the gunner seat spawn for the AH-94 in multiplayer?
should be an option in the unit's settings
drag the allowed slots slider to the right

Is there any functional difference between a 'Player Spawn' and an 'MP Spawn'?
Yes
Player spawns dont work in MP

Do allied ships in vtol have any ground strike potential?
They'll engage some ground targets, but not with missiles
only with their guns

do you by any chance know the approximate range?
no clue, could be anywhere over 10nm lol
I will look into it

what are the values for the pac-3?
like it seems to hit mach 4+ on its booster then struggle to maintain mach 1.5 on sustainer
and if you turn even a minor amount its like subsonic

Or just a cheeky javelin missile?
Need a quick reminder, Say I have a Event sequence with a delay of 900 seconds
Entry condition is obviously conditions need to be met before delay

but does the EXIT condition basically forgoes the remaining timer and start if conditions are true?
Delay -> Wait for entry condition -> Actions -> Wait for exit condition
nothing is ever skipped

but having an exit condition is the same as having a entry condition on the next node correct?
not if there is a delay as well, as that happens before it checks the entry condition
well I have an event sequence. and I want to give the player two options, comply with the objective to land somewhere within 3 minutes and start the event

Great list, can you add dumb-fire rocket ammo to the MANPAD equipables ;)?

It does own it
Have you tried deleting the item from the workshop manually, then uploading again?

Have you tried deleting the item from the workshop manually, then uploading again?
yes, same result
Well, the log says "You're not the owner of this item.", but I don't know what "this item" it's referring to.

is it a mission from scratch?
basically yes I only took the map 'Grand Canyon' and then put all objectives enemies etc in there
When I encountered this issue, it was because the images used in the mission where too large. I think the cap is like 1-2MB. I resized all the images to 512x512p and even smaller for some others and it worked after that

What's up ya'll. If ATC doesn't answer voice comms is that just a bug or did I mess up a setting somewhere in mission editor?
Also most of the time any BGM I use is off for friends playing my missions, is that also a bug?
Also is there any way for me to test missions without actually entering them? Would save sm time

Give it a completion condition that isn't instantly satisfied?  Can you post a screenshot of the objective panel?

Give it a completion condition that isn't instantly satisfied?  Can you post a screenshot of the objective panel?
The only way it could be a mission issue is if you didn't label the airbase correctly in the map. It needs to be named in the **map**, not in the mission.
if i left itblank is it immidetly completed

Oh. you selected a player as the destroy target? Lol, I don't think it's designed for that.
Players are super unique in that they can respawn. The destroy objective isn't designed to handle that.
well what would i do to make it work

Is it just me or do Campaigns not keep their information if you save them?
I've set the damn description 7 times now
Someone else was complaining about that

the "detected by" property is affected by EOTS right?
Yes
Detection is more or less when the unit is revealed by any sensor

But is there a max number of players on a team?
That’s the only thing I could think of
It’s co-op with 9 players

Is there a way in stable mission editor for a mp mission  to change the ah-94 skin to the desert pink used in sp training?
the desert skin is used for player aircraft that are on team B
Ok thank you 👍

@Strikeeaglechase  do you know the building name ID of the airbase hangars ? I wonder if it can manually be added in a map , editing the .vt file
I don't believe they are their own static objects, so dosn't seem like its possible
they are just regular unity mesh's on the airbase

Interestingly the tutorials are static objects...? I have no idea what they do and there's no mesh for them
what are the full name of those tut ojbect ? gonna try them 😄
``` Tut_BasicFlight Tut_GettingStarted Tut_Weapons1 VFTraining1Prefab ```

what are the full name of those tut ojbect ? gonna try them 😄
``` Tut_BasicFlight Tut_GettingStarted Tut_Weapons1 VFTraining1Prefab ```
They seem very custom so probably do nothing (or completely break) if not put in the right mission. `Tut_GettingStarted` and `VFTraining1Prefab` might do nothing at all, there's some lists that are just empty for those

Anyone have any suggestions on improving a missions command chain while making a mission?
command chain?
Who’s leading what aircraft and what these aircraft role is in the mission

Ohhh that gave me an idea, I can name the slots in the editor right?
Not yet
Unfortunately not yet

Just the numbers or the letter too?
You can change the letter (what unit group they are in)
The numbers will automatically change depending on their order in the unit group

guys how do u limit the number of aircraft used by a team?
Define limit
Do you mean like, lives?

Do you mean like, lives?
He’s making some missions with me I was in front when he asked, we mean when making a multiplayer campaign is there a way to limit the total number of lives a team has instead of just giving each aircraft a life, becuase if your are playing the campaign by yourself and we limit each aircraft to one you get 4 lives becuase there are four aircraft.
How would we go about making the lives as one life pool the team shares

Why do you need a more explicit team life pool?
becuase a game dose not always have all 4 players so if there are only 3 people playing now there is one extra life that one player gets, its not a big problem if a life pool system is not in the game i just thuaght it would be better to do it that way
> becuase a game dose not always have all 4 players so if there are only 3 people playing now there is one extra life that one player gets Right. And if you instead had a shared pool of 4 lives then it would be the same with 3 players in that only one player could respawn after death.   > its not a big problem if a life pool system is not in the game i just thuaght it would be better to do it that way It's not in the game, but it's sorta possible to implement with triggers. But I'd need to know exactly how you *want* it to function to provide an implementation.

Is there a steam workshop issue?
I uploaded my map to workshop (it shows it updated 4 mins ago) but the game isn't pulling the latest version
Yep

Hey! How do I activate one of 3 available objectives randomly?
Use a conditional action with Chance conditions.
If this objective comes in the middle of the mission, put the conditional action in a complete action for another objective.

Another question. How do I trigger a PvP victory of a specific team using an action?
victory is achieved when all required objectives are complete
Ok, thanks, that will work too.

"What if everyone is dead?"
Then E4 Overlord laughs at your sorry carcasses.
I mean unless two people splash each other on the same frame it should say one team wins

Are they part of the wrong unit group? Or do you give them any other orders such as target priority?
Nope, just spawn.
I put them as a unit group AFTER finding out they took off on spawn, to see if this fixes anything, but havnt tested it since

Hello again! How do I create a custom base not from a prefab? I want to have a small FOB for VTOL vehicles which has ATC functionality and allows rearming on the helipads. So far I could only find the Big and medium airfields as prefabs in the map editor. If I don't add those, in the mission editor my "bases" tab is empty and has no option to create one.
You can place helipads under the "static objects" tab in the mission (not map) editor. Then you can create rearm points under the units tab.
There is no way to create a FOB with ATC

I see there is a system of rewards for completing objectives. But I don't see the rewarded score on the scoreboard at the end of the mission. Is there a way to see it?
Pretty sure that reward is in currency for purchasing weapons, which only works in SP.
is there any way to turn off a radar so that an ARM might miss

any way to turn off a radar in general though?
Depends on the unit. For MAD-4 Radar, the "Set Engage Enemies" action toggles their radar.
any way to do it for an S/A?

any way to do it for an S/A?
Dunno
ok

and i'm fairly sure in real life, if you turn off one radar and turn a decoy on somewhere else, it would redirect (although i might be stupid), is that possibly modelled in vtol?
ask @Strikeeaglechase , not #mission_editor
aight sorry

I'll probably need this a number of times, do you know if I reference this conditional id in multiple events, I can reuse it?
Not too hard to copy in the VTS
Create a nearly empty condition that just checks UnitNearWaypoint 88888km so it can easily be searched for, then using text editor replace that entire conditional with a copy of the one you made previously. Just be sure to update the IDs

so it's better to check for each player in your example, can't use unit list I guess?
Nah, because this kind of check would normally be a FOR loop (which doesn't exist in VTeditor)
Does NOT ALIVE also count a player that isn't occupying that vehicle slot

The Steam Workshop issue (Having to validate files) thing isn't fixed yet is it?
it just was https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444239937152352277/1009932203536424960

It really doesn't care if they rally around E1 or E2?
I want them within 100meters of either of those specific locations, so that I, as the mapper know where they'll be when I do X
might bump the number a little higher

I might have uncovered a bug, gonna have to repro this later but...  Remember my issues  earlier with the NPC Planes and a Super Carrier?  Well how that happened was I first made the a bunch of ASF-30 planes, set them to not spawn immediately, then set them on the airfield. Cold Start, Parked.  Then I attached them to the Super Carrier, which naturally moved them onto it. Did some gameplay tests, but they were spawning and attacking too aggressively so I moved them back to the air field and put a take off command on player proximity.  Now, what I forgot to do was to remove them from the Carrier Slots, but their models still showed on the airfield. This caused a secondary issue where they simply would not spawn on either the carrier or the airfield even if I had an event to spawn them.  To fix it, I simply removed their spawns from the carrier and they worked as intended.
Is it possible to download mission editor data from steam workshop? Seems I lost my campaign editor data that uploaded in the past.
any way to to make a group of artillery bombard a waypoint or do i have to set each individually?

Nope. There's no unitgroup fire at waypoint action because a unitgroup can contain mixed ground units besides artillery.

In pvp the wining team is the one that compelete all its required objective, correct?

Correct. Either side completing all required objectives ends the mission with their team winning. Either side failing a required objective completes the mission with the other team winning.

Send your player log after trying to upload?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Hey! Is there a way to compare 2 global values between each other?
Not currently, but Baha expressed interest in adding the feature. https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/991424667237765310 (fixed link)
Thanks! The issue I am trying to solve. 2 teams are completing objectives. If one completes all the objectives, it wins (this is easy). There is also a mission timer. And if it expires the team which completed more objectives should win. I was thinking of implementing it with comparing global values, but since it is not yet implemented, I can do it by adding 1 to a single value if team A completes an objective and subtracting 1 if team B does. But I also want in case of equal amount of completed objectives to make that the team which completed the last objective earlier to win. This I don't know how to resolve so far.

So is there any way to not have them respond like that?
Add a "last obj" GV that gets toggled every time a team completes an objective. 1 when team A, 2 when team B If timer expires, and the GV you made previously is 0 (both teams have equal objectives), then the value of the new GV determines the winner
Since you want the earlier team to score, a value of 1 means team B wins on a tie

You know about Conditional Actions?
Yes, you've taught me a couple of days ago 🙂 I got it, thanks.
If they are part of the same unit group as the player they will automatically form up on them. So either assign them to a different group or I think you can just give them an explicit command to do something else.

Couldn’t you have just made a spawn on team a but not allow players to join team a?
is the cursor heading also the ingame heading?
or make a spawn on team A that's a cold start in the air, so they crash immediately, with a briefing that just says "you joined the wrong team"

Anyone have a good way to tell wingmen to take off at your command, but otherwise stay on deck until you tell them to?
Default behavior parked?
Nope.

Well, I come to ask a question and I already see the answer. That's sad. I've been trying to use a trigger like a procedure. Having a list of actions there which needs repeated calls in the same sequence. Any alternative solution for that?
If the mission is PvE, you can create an objective on Team B with objective start actions for what you want to do, and also an action to cancel itself. Every time you want to run those actions start the objective.
My mission is PvP.

Ok, I'll try to think of something. And another question. Can I somehow make both teams lose? When I fail their main objectives in 2 consecutive actions, the second one always wins, since the first team fails the objective earlier.
nope
one team losing also causes the other team to win

Sequence can also run only once, right?
yes
Well, I've tried your first suggestion with a fake objective which gets cancelled, but in the same team. It's not too bad, since the end of my "procedure" actually results in a new objective, so the player does not see the message about the fake objective. Thanks! Should be good enough.

i figured this is probably the place to ask where can i find the stock in game missions like the desert cobra Champaign ?
They aren't normally available to edit, but can be extracted from the game files and converted to CustomScenarios with the right tools and knowledge.

@Sypwn I just want to say that I absolutely adore the Quick version of Dynamic Liberation, it's practically the only mission I host in public lobbies lately. It's great! Really renewed my fun for VTOL VR almost by itself.
Specifically I would like to know how to get ground units to actually follow roads instead of just running through them as though they don't exist.

should I be using railpath or normal path?
normal path
railpath is old code left over in the game

Good morning.  I have a question for anyone who knows the editor pretty well.  I'm currently trying to teach myself how to use it, and I'm having difficulty with one particular issue.  I'm trying to find a way to send a list of GPS waypoints to all players of a multiplayer mission that stays available after death (or can be refreshed after death).  So far: - A proximity trigger at the MP spawns to send GPS waypoints doesn't seem to refresh on death.  (I'm assuming this can only fire once.  I don't know how to change that.) - An objective that sends the GPS waypoints as a start event doesn't seem to send them at all. I've tried slight variations of both of these, but I haven't gotten it to work yet.  If anyone knows what I'm missing here, please let me know.  Thanks.

`GPS waypoints as a start event doesn't seem to send them at all.`  is it at the start of the mission?
Trigger can only fire once unfortunately
Good to know.

To be clear, you mean for triggering the objective?
If it trigger the gps event on activation and if the objective start immediatly on mission start, yes
Okay, great.  You might have just fixed my issue, because I never thought of that.  Thanks!  I'll try it tonight.

So a second should be enough to get around the latency?
on mission start I think so
if a player would take more than 1 sec from Lobby > start > ingame, he would be screwed tho

Would this still work for people joining late?
which is apparently the golden number for Live TV delay 😄
unfortunately no

how many pepole can be on one team?
up to 16 players in a lobby, and you can split it between the teams however you want (including 16-0)
thx

Happy to announce that my map is in Closed Beta, content is done, doing closed beta testing this weekend for performance tests and (hopefully) no bugs 🙂

is there a way to download campaigns that people have posted on the workshop in order to view how they work in the mission editor?
Afaik you would need to contact the original mission creator to get the original mission files, but I could be wrong
ok

in standalone missions, you can force a player's plane to break as an action in an event. I cant seem to find this option in the multiplayer campaign. Does anyone know where it is or how to do something similar?
Currently not possible in MP.
(I don't understand why)

im trying to prevent peopl from going above a certain altitude, how else could i do that without affecting the whole team?
Nothing clean
im just going to have to set up loads of SEAD arent I

Would that borkenness also include "within radius" triggers?
no those work fine
I am bad at conditional events confirmed 😦

then only afterward while loop is effective?
does the player spawn inside the zone?
nope

does the player spawn inside the zone?
nope
outside, drives inside

So then that means a While loop that has fired, then gone false, cannot be reactivated at any time? Say I wanted to make a wave event.
or a ...I dunno King of the Hill Event
players fighting over a zone

This one’s for the rising storm 2 fans. Just finished testing on my first legit mission/map and I wanted to share; any feedback would most certainly be appreciated.

Unfortunately the ai pathing does not seem to handle the valley well. It’s a cointoss whether the fa-26 and av-42 will actually land/bomb or just fly into a hill trying. Sometimes the fa-26 will go for bombing runs and fly over/drop flares but not actually drop bombs as well, although I’m not sure if that’s something I’m causing.
hey fellas, do you know what's involved in fulfilling the landing condition in the condition editor? is it coming to a complete stop or will it count as landing if you've touched down and you're moving at <50knots?

alright, thanks!

What exactly does stayinradius do on unit tools tab? Assume it let's the unit free roam in a specified area - and if so how do you define the radius? Thanks.
They'll continually go towards a DEFAULT WAYPOINT and never stop unless destroyed or told to do something else. They'll keep making short little "donuts" towards the waypoint, drive past, turn back towards the waypoint and try again in a small radius.
if you have the unit in a unit group, then it won't go to that waypoint unless the unit group is given the MOVE TO command

Make a mission that you would want to play yourself. If you enjoy testing it, then others will enjoy playing it

.. good missions? First make a mission, then make it harder until you cannot win alone, then add a player and move to public testing, then make it harder again, add player, rinse and repeat until the mission grows legs , and if nobody picks it up and plays it ...  start over from scratch !   After just a few you will start to make great missions !! Good Luck

Hi - been away for a while.  Has recurring / looping events been added yet - eg  if x enters y trigger  z event but it remains active unless deactivated so will trigger  multiple times. Or has there been any update /indication if it may be added in near future updates?
Literally last week. It's in public_testing
That's great news - thank you. Will just have to wait until its pushed to stable for the mission I'm working on - but I'll try it in public 👍

I cant seem to find this in a search. Will setting alt spawns for a player craft allow them to choose where they spawn?
No. The only way to do that is to create separate MP slots at each location.
Noted. Was hoping it would work similar to how the Heli works in DynLib. Thanks anyways!

But you have to tie it to a specific event, correct? Is that the same as in the chopper or if I set multiple spawns will it give an option for that airframe?
Not exactly sure what you're asking but  > Is that the same as in the chopper Spawn points behave the same regardless of what kind of aircraft it is. Dyn Lib only moving the chopper spawns was a mission design choice, not a game limitation.  > if I set multiple spawns will it give an option for that airframe? There is no way to present a spawn location option to players, beyond their choice of which aircraft slot to select in the lobby
I see. I may have misunderstood when a pilot told me he could select an airbase spawn, but what he probably meant was "once airbase is captured helis will spawn there instead of on Mom."
 Great work on DynLib btw

Yes. There is an Event Sequence dedicated to moving the chopper spawn points at the appropriate times.

Yeah would be nice to be able to set speeds and have it slow down on landing requests etc. I'm sure this is probably asked often, but is there any known plan to expand the editors capabilities?
Nothing on changing fleet speeds, but trigger looping and AI unit respawning was just finally added last week. It's in the public_testing branch right now.  My editor wishlist thread is here: https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/962116934730678332
and one of my posts there does include a request for naval unit speed options

Is there any way to set up a hard ceiling for a multiplayer mission?
I’m currently using invincible Sam sites to enforce one
There is now in the public_testing branch. You can make a looping trigger that watches for players to reach a certain altitude, then action kill them.

The ability to kill players via a trigger is coming in this next update too?
yes
Although the dev has mentioned he would prefer you kill players naturally when possible instead instead of trigger killing. For example, @Indybin using trigger looping you can make those SAMs ignore targets unless they go above a certain altitude.

Anyone know how to mimic freeflight when it comes to objectives?
I thought freeflight has no objective
well the campaign I'm working on has no objectives, but whenever I spawn in to test it the mission finishes and I can't just respawn back in when I die

I'm confused as I haven't changed anything in that area really and the last campaign I made didn't have this issue
no it's multiplayer

can you provide your player.log after playing the mission?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2.

Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.
It doesn't look like you played an MP mission in this log.

Just set the mpspawn to be on the carrier deck in its settings?
i know I can do that but I want to be able to move the spawn
guess only one way to find out

Generally I would use the move spawn action to move the spawn but ig if it doesn’t work well for spawning on carriers?
You can set the player spawn point to any airfield and then edit your carrier and assign the deck locations to your players. You will then spawn on the carrier instead of the airfield however you can re-arm at that airfield in game.
This just points players to where they spawned when they press the RTB button on their NAV page. you'll have to use move spawn triggers or alt spawns to move player's spawn points around

Yeah, got that now. Now I've got that weird Green plane. How do I set  that to the other planes?
How does that become the F/A-26 e.g.
should be in the unit settings

Or do i just spawn another plane right above it?
Hmmm
I don't see all of that

is there a particular unit limit?
Nope
Dynamic liberation I believe has over a thousand units

I have tried editing the .VTS file directly because I need to copy/paste a lot of functions (triggers only work once), but it did not take my edits once saved. Is it even possible to edit the .VTS file directly?
you need to fully close the game and reopen it to reload your changes from disk
ahh ok, will give it a try then thanks!

you can set an event for units to board an aircraft i believe

Everything looks correct here from what I know. Perhaps you also need a dropoff objective before they will board?
I do have one
with waypoint and all

does that work even without an objective?
im not sure
might

You were applying the break when you landed?
If you have a slight velocity AI will not try to board you when the door are open

I think it's just for oil rigs, to see if they've been destroyed
it fixed it

is there a way to make infantry units board the closes AV-42C?
can i get to the mission editor without going into vr first?
yes

can i get to the mission editor without going into vr first?
yes
you can launch the game without the headset, and in the bottom right corner you'll see the editors

do the event triggers keep checking even after they've been triggered? or just once
Currently looping triggers are available on PTB, as a sequence event
Player or AI?

Both? Would be great if I could have players do pickups instead of the AI, but have it pick up the slack when the players don't do it
For AI, it’s an action on the infantry units to board the AV-42C. Same to disembark
For player, pickup/drop off objectives will automatically have them board your plane

Another small issue i have been having is when I try to test the scenario and launch it in the editor.  The mission fails to load in VR. Is there a specific order I should open missions in the editor/oculus/steamVR, that I need? (I usually have them all closed) I'll put the headset on an only see my monitors.
No. VR should work fine when launched from the editor. Please post your log.
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

What headset do you have? Does VR work normally before you enter the editor?
I have the oculus quest. I open in in VR, but when I click to the editor it switches to desktop and the headset comes off. I have the issue after that. When I put the headset back on it shows my monitors in 2d VR mode. I'll check about the log.
It's normal for the editor to only show on the monitor. But the VR should return as soon as you exit the editor back to the menu, or when you start testing a mission. (The helmet room should be in VR)

could I just have a single waypoint to act as a battle locus of sorts?
the naval fleets move towards the waypoint, and all associated aircraft orbit around it
I think what you're describing is basically just patrol paths

Hey all another question I couldnt find an answer for. I want to drop off troops on a carrier. I saw some chat in here saying it needed to be a static object in order for it to work but the only static object for sea in the editor is an oil platform. any suggestions?
I think they mean it has to be not moving. I haven't messed with dropping off troops myself, but theoretically as long as it's stopped in a known location, you can put a waypoint there as a dropoff destination.
hmm ok, I set a waypoint but it just kind of hovers. it doesnt set itself on the carrier so i didnt know if it would trigger the drop off. Ill try that and see what happens

If you don't check the allow reloads on a mad4 / Sam launcher does it just fire at random intervals rather than a set reload time. I've had Sam lnr  fire repeated times without the allow reload box being checked?
Afaik each launcher has a number of missiles available for it to fire, kind of like a magazine. Allow reload just lets it refill that magazine after a period of time once fully depleted
Thanks Smol 👍

I am looking for some help on how to start with GPS coordinates in the GPS system for target groups in the aircraft. Can someone walk me through how I would set that up in the mission editor to start the mission with these GPS targets already in the aircraft?
singleplayer or multiplayer mission?
Multiplayer mission

Hmmm it shouldn't be aircraft dependent right?
Are you creating them right at the start of the mission? I put it on a 3 sec delay from mission start to ensure the aircraft has loaded in.
It won't affect players who aren't fully loaded in their aircraft when it triggers.

I'm trying to play a custom map but I need to make a mission, how do I quickly make a free flight mission?
Uhhhh... create a singleplayer mission, select your map, add a player spawn point, save, then launch a test run
Yeah but I'm trying to fly a jet, not use a helicopter

can i test a multiplayer mission in multiplayer without uploading it first?
As much as I know, No.
You can upload and immediately change it to ~~hidden~~ unlisted or friends only through steam

can you change the order of listed missions in a campaign?
Yes, Maravrin, you can click and drag the missions to whatever order you like. 🙂
lol THanks

Is there an easy way to get a "high quality" Image of a map your using for briefing purposes?
I use the minimap tool in the mission editor
interesting Ill give that a try. Thanks Sypwn... Eagle Dynamics should pay you for the amount of help you give

Wondering if anyone else has had this problem? Whenever I try to reset the player vehicle I can't type a heading, speed, or fade time. Every time I enter a number it just sets it to 0.
Odd
try restarting the game?

Is there any other way to reset the player to another spot?
Is this a singleplayer mission?
Yes

Is this a singleplayer mission?
Yes
I didn't even know "resetting" a player was an option. In SP, once the player dies, the mission fails.

Maybe wait for the player to return to a waypoint after each wave?
Or you could make it an MP mission and have the player eject to reset.
It can be an MP mission with only one slot.

Are we talking about a player? Or an AI unit?
A player
But only send it to the player that entered it

How do I get the drone carrier to use its drones offensively?
I'm trying to make the ship engage an allied cruiser, to send out its drones to attack it
hopefully from beyond the cruisers anti ship missile range

can someone help me with having AI taxi and takeoff using paths?
The AI will taxi/takeoff themselves, you just command them to takeoff
You don't manually create the paths for em

not even for AWACs and tankers?
Yep all AI aircraft will taxi on their own
thank you

@Strikeeaglechase how would you make an AI (in my case a B-11 Bomber) bomb a certain area?
use the Bomb Waypoint event action
Ok good Sypwn is here, I have no idea lmao

Does the current or PT mission editor have a way to detect and codify number of players that are in a game?  I have another way to do it, but I was hoping for something more streamlined.

UnitList (check all players) number alive greater/less than...
It will count players that are alive and spawned in

That actually begs the question how it looks at ALL type conditionals.  I know with AI it considered both spawned and unspawned units.        Example: group alpha is 4 player mp spawns. I have the conditional event: trueIF(ALL(Group_Alpha)=near_wpt).   If I only have only 3 players, would it be able to print true if the 3 players meet the conditional?
Lol nvm, even if it works the same as AI, I can still make a conditional flow that considers all options.
For ALL conditionals, it looks at all units regardless of alive or dead. So for `ALL (players) Near Waypoint` to be fulfilled, all player slots would have to be occupied and spawned in.

hey fellas, do lots of road being placed in a map have a significant impact on performance/frame rate in missions?
Not much, but I'm sure if you stack enough in a small area they will. L'etranger has built entire structures out of roads.
Cool, then I doubt what i'm up to will affect performance too much

Hi i started 3 days ago with the editor. I got tanks running into buildings. Path is set in linear but still they do continue. How ca.n i solve this? Also what are all the other path options like follow and Railpath? Whats thw difference there?
IIRC Railpath is something leftover and shouldn't be used, and units don't care about your placed buildings they just drive through everything no way around that but moving the paths themselves
Hey is there any reason that when I try to upload my mission to Steam Workshop I get "Error: Limit Exceeded". Has this ever happened to anybody?

Hey is there any reason that when I try to upload my mission to Steam Workshop I get "Error: Limit Exceeded". Has this ever happened to anybody?
The answer is that your mission/campaign's primary image is larger than 1MB
Thanks @Sypwn , I found that if I used a smaller image but tried uploading from within the mission editor it wouldn't change. You have to edit from within the campaign editor for anybody who gets the "Error: Limit Exceeded" and doesn't find a fix in the future.

Maybe define an exit condition as 'MP_Spawn 5' IS NOT locking target 'ON'. Wont the trigger hang indefinitely waiting for an exit condition to 'end' the sequence?
When you talk about "turning on" and "turning off" the respawning of the tank, are you stopping and starting any sequences? Or are you only toggling the value of that GV?
Also, the respawner sequence should have an exit condition of waiting for the tank to be dead. Otherwise it will run every second trying to spawn the tank over and over even when it's still alive, which will spam your player log.

I am solely just changing the GV, figured it would work just with that. Should I also stop and start the event as well?

No, I was just making sure. Next step would be to search for sequence entries in the player log
Was gonna do this

Hey, how do I use this thing?
Uhh you'll need nodejs installed, maybe ill setup a simple website to convert easier
@ISEGaming if you can create a test mission that recreates the logic you're having trouble with, then zip that up and upload it, that would be very helpful.

@Sypwn what sort of validation would be useful? First thing I thought of was checking `unitInstanceID` to make sure all IDs are unique
Validation on what?
VTS file

Oh, lol. If you wanted to make a tool to assist mission creators in doing things that are tedious in the VTEdit, that would be awesome. Validation, copying/moving actions and conditionals, reassigning conditionals, etc. But for a VTS-JSON converter? It's not as important.  If you want to have it validate as many IDs as you can, that would be cool. Unit instances, conditionals, conditional action blocks.
> that would be awesome Issue is thats all UI heavy
which I suck at lmao

Could you send me a vts file with such errors so I can test?
Tomorrow. I'm too tired to think now
I just so happen to be a front-end web developer, and I often make my own UI's, so I can help ya there 🙂

So you mean a unique numerical value used for referencing? Yes
And again, there are over a dozen different types of IDs in a VTS file. Units, waypoints, objectives, paths, bases, static objects, timed events, conditional events, event sequences, conditions, conditional actions nodes, global values...
some have useful unique names like `unitInstanceID`, but most just say `id`

what would you need from me if I made a very basic front-end?
I could do it myself if I had the motivation. I just haven't had a real need, and the fact that I have to completely quit and relaunch the game to load changes from disk means it would be a real hassle to use regardless.
prolly just gonna make a intex.html file with some css

like sort all (Unit/objectives/etc) Alpha?
thanks for the info Neo.
hello. My editor seems not to save the image and description in the Mp mission editor.  Am i doing something wrong? Also on steam it does jot show an image unless you actually click on the link to the map in the workshop. Hope someone can give me a clue on solving that. Thanks

nope, its very annoying
sometimes reloading the game seems to fix it? (after you assign the image and description)

strange. It makes it at every time i use the editor. Thanks anyhow for the quick reply.

im trying to make a mp "campaign"(its just one mission) but i cna only place one spawn point and even when its placed it still says theres an error  any help?
I'm assuming you've selected the Multiplayer option, so I'd assume that maybe you put down a SP spawn point and forgot to delete it? Other than that, I'm not sure.
i can only place sp spawn point and i DID make it an mp campaign so unless i am missing something and cant find the mp spawn points i dont know what to say

i can try
thats if i can find the folder again

You sent me a normal standalone singleplayer mission. You sure this was in your campaigns folder?
It doesn't show up ingame for me if I put it in my Campaigns folder
THERE IS NO CAMAIGN FOLDER

I agree ... wut ?
uh idk just send an image of what you have it set up as
pick up objective, set ur conditions then select the troops u pickup

Can you post a screenshot here?
i wa bouta say
havent even lost my nitro yet and people are already ignoring my existence again -_-

These are the options offered ?
and there arent any other missions yet
Yup

Before I get them to load ?
no
can u get vc?

any of that not make sense at all?
Thanks ... now lets see how much I absorbed  .. ha ! I will check back L8r
yes it was good

What if you put them under tabs listed across the top of the screen?
Because my units list is like 700 units long
Is this an external mission editor?

I have a question... are unspawned AI aircraft considered not alive in the conditional editor?
they are alive until destroyed

Is there anyway to detect when the player ejects?
You can check if the player is dead, but I don't think you can see if they ejected afterwards.

Is there anyway to detect when the player ejects?

Only with single player maps if you use the conditionals to check if the player uses the ejection handle.

What are you more generally trying to do?
Just trigger an event when the player either dies or ejects. It’s easy to do on player death but I’m trying to figure out how to trigger it on an ejection as well since dying from a missile is rare
And also have it triggered before the player respawns

hey guys I'm trying my hand at making a mission, I used to make broodwar maps so I'm fairly savvy,  but if there was a website or wiki I can look at and how to make the map a multiplayer app?
"map not app
Ejection counts as death.

Hi, How to a change all the MP spawn points in the MP mission? I want to change the spawn points from the starting missions airport to an airport that has been taken over. The spawn points for each players should then be there permanent.  Thanks in advance for the help.
There is an event to change the spawn. But you have to set an alt spawn in the unit editor
Great. found it. Thanks !!!!!!!👍

Is there a way to adjust the volume of custom audio files in the mission editor? Because the voice lines and stuff im using are all easily 3 times louder than ingame voicelines when I launch the missions...
Not through the editor. Just fix them using Audacity
I see. so I need to use third party means then... thats a shame and extremely tedious, given its over 20 files.

thanks for the help yesterday guys.  I'm playing with the map editor running a "capture " the bases map. ie have 5 airports on a map, and teams can take over/retake 3 of airfields. once a team has 4 airfields the game is over   Is this something the editor can handle? I know it can do single take overs, plenty of maps have this feature already, but can it change sides multiple times?  another question would be respawning the base defenses everytime it changes sides, is this also possible?
just before I go to far making placeables for something unachievable
Both of these (recapturable bases and respawning units) are possible but only in the new VTOL version 1.5 in public_testing. People are already starting to build MOBAs and stuff.

Quick question related to separated briefings; other than checking separated briefings in the editor is there anything else preventing the host from choosing the room type?  I have separate rooms unchecked in the editor and it’s false in the vts file, but it won’t let me chose the room when launching from the editor or hosting privately on the ptb
I believe if there are too many player slots you are forced to use the large combined
Since the separate briefing rooms supports only 12 people (6 per team) I believe

quick question: is there a way to count the player's kills?  I want a certain voice line to play after the player shot down 2 or 3 enemies, but i cant figure that out.  I can make voice lines play if certain enemies are shot down in general by anyone, but not the player specifically.  basically... how do I detect if the player made the kill, and not one of the npc's?

In an MP mission you can track how many kills the players together have gotten by using the score feature. But I don't think there is a way to detect which unit or player got a single kill.
ah, I see...  since its a single player mission, I guess Im... probably gonna have to see about being creative some other way.  though, good point on the score feature via multiplayer... maybe I can convert the map to be multiplayer capable, while still using that feature... hmm...

```validating campaign scenario hawaiattack - mapID: Hawaii_1764918363 Unable to locate map: Hawaii_1764918363 hawaiattack: Map must be packed!``` Something is wrong with the map for this mission. Did you create it yourself? Or did you use one from the workshop?
I used one from the workshop
Hmm. I haven't done that myself yet.

Do you think I should try to remake the mission on a different map?
If you can wait a day or two, I can try to experiment with workshop maps and see if it's a limitation.
ok thx I think I will work on another map for now

Why did this ping *me?*
Am I a moderator now?

I haven't been able to reproduce your error. Campaigns containing workshop maps seem pretty resilient.

@Strikeeaglechase @Sypwn following up, anything else needed on this UI? I'd like to get this thing rolling.
probably should have a separate thread for it
I extremely rarely use the editor so I cannot comment

Does the "Sort IDs" tab let you drag and drop the units around?
But I thought you would be the one implementing the thing
yes

Alhough it might be faster in this app. thoughts?
Bulk rename, maybe. But I wouldn't bother with features that exist in the editor.
Bulk rename would be nice, not sure how to go about doing that, other than a search and replace

of whats currently being dragged?
yeah
kk

i think i know the answer but just to be sure, let's say someone hipotheticaly had to format it's pc and forgot to backup the editors custom missions.. its there a way to retrieve them ?

On average how long does it take for a ship to fully sink in game?
And if an infantry goes underwater do they immediately die as well?
They half sink, then stay there for a while, then eventually despawn I think? Not sure on the timing.

erm... ok, just a precautionary question, but if I've published a scenario... and I lost the custom scenario files... how exactly could you get those files back? or is that scenario now just... dead and non-updatable?  havent happened to me, but im just curious.
There's not *really* a way
just backup your mission files always

To be honest though, im useless at scripting (if I wanna do it myself)... but Im still curious regardless, lol. How would a script help recover the files? I know you can get the custom scenario and custom map files in steam's workshop folders, but yeah... thats about it
> How would a script help recover the files? The files on the workshop are basically encrypted, the script undoes that
After that your left with just a regular mission that you can edit

I have just found out about this feature for Visual Studio Code? SliptUp, SplitDown, SplitLeft, SplitRight
That`s before you load the File You can have different files open on one window without using the Tab above to choose the file to look for.
What does this have to do with the mission editor?

What does this have to do with the mission editor?
You will see in 1 minuet
So if you look at the text file names I can have all open in one windows so in the Image belows I could have a Mission Todo list this could inclused OBjectives and how many units per Enemy or Allied

How do I exit mission testing? Is there anyway to force end the mission and go back to the editor?
Nevermind. You just have to press Delete
is it possible to open steam workshop missions in the editor?

is it possible to open steam workshop missions in the editor?
Only if they are your own
ah that's a shame]

I would assume so. You could probably run a test for that with tutorial messages.    I never used the initial delay thing because I can just.. you know, add? If I want the actions to delay after the event is triggered, I just add that to the time delay of each action.
In the editor when you put in for example like 300 for something like a trigger, it’s 300 meters right? It’s not like unreal engine where every unit is actually like like 2 centimeters or some bs?
yeah editor is almost entirely in meters

yeah editor is almost entirely in meters
There's a measuring tool in one of the top menus.

is there an opfor tanker for refueling?
Doesn't seem to be.
damn

I have also noticed if you change the Delay for each event they move out of order not sure if you have seen or noticed this?
For example if you where to change there delay to 600s = 10 mins or 300s = 5 mins
Are you referring to timed events?

Are you referring to timed events?
In a timed event group, the specified delay for each node is relative to the start of the event (after the initial delay). So for a timed event group like this:
```T+0   - Mission start (nothing happens) T+120 - GAV-25 spawns in T+150 - GAV-25 takes off T+180 - GAV-25 moves to attack player```

So if you and another player would play you both would have to complete objectives related to your Mission if one player has completed all objectives but not Return to carrier Objective then the hole mission fails and the 2nd player can no longer complete the Scenario Missions?
For testing how ever I let AI take out Golf then I will take to the air with my wingmen to take out India Enemy`s this will not be available in the Steam workshop update release both players must spawn in.
even if you spawn in on your own you would have to wait for Either Bravo Player or Sierra Player to spawn depending what unit you chose.

So How I want it to work is Only Bravo Mission Objectives will be visible ok obj screen of the aircraft when they all completed there mission there mission trigger would Stop and Sierra Mission would Start then all of Bravo Objectives are not showing only Sierra Objectives are showing?
> So How I want it to work is Only Bravo Mission Objectives will be visible ok obj screen of the aircraft when they all completed there mission there mission trigger would Stop and Sierra Mission would Start then all of Bravo Objectives are not showing only Sierra Objectives are showing?  I can't decipher this sentence. Is it missing punctuation?
As when I have tested instead of it saying Bravo Takeoff , Bravo Defeat Enemy Golf, I notice that the only objective that shows is Sierra Defeat India

Obj is short for Objectives on the aircraft main screen with all opstions

```mips so what if I dont want any Objectives or missions to start until the timed event is over? ```
Then you set `Start Mode: Triggered` and use triggers to activate them with the timer.
are conditions still relevant or only used for like combat in the air, So for example Golf is num allive = 0, then Objective Bravo Return, but cancels all other objectives that are no long needed as all enemy aircraft are dead.

Or how does the Objectives get completed?
I have never gone into detail before
> are conditions still relevant or only used for like combat in the air Yes, for objectives that do not fit into the standard objective types.  > So for example Golf is num allive = 0 That sounds like a Destroy objective would work, but you can still use a conditional if you prefer.  > then Objective Bravo Return Then *what* Objective Bravo Return? I think you're missing a verb?  > but cancels all other objectives that are no long needed as all enemy aircraft are dead. I know you tried to explain your mission earlier, but it takes me too much effort to decipher your writing. You can make the completion of one objective complete the others, or cancel them. If you cancel other objectives then they can't be used for prerequisite objectives, as they have to be completed to count toward the prerequisite.

I will record my screen of the missions, and objectives if that will help?
it certainly wouldn't hurt

Should I just stream it on YouTube but make it unlisted then I can send you the link to watch also do you have a mic so if you see me make a mistake you can point it out?

Through discord I mean in VC for the mic so I can hear what your saying as when I will be in mission editor, I will not see chat and it will be disabled also
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

I forgot to ask where can I find the wiki for VTEditor?
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor
Thanks

Is there anybody here who have had Event Sequence experiences?
yes many people do
I just need one of them for support at this moment in time.

Are you able to join VC so I can screen share?
it is 1 AM
Its 04:55 AM for me

Ok what would you call Military Time?
What?
Anyway we are off topic

So I the images I have added Do I still need to add the Objectives to Sequence Event or no?
I am sort of confused about this as I have set the events in the Objectives themselves.
You can set the events in the objektive and only trigger the objektive in the first node.  Second node seems to be conditional so I would not touch it.

1. Place players and friendly units. 2. Place enemies to kill. 3. Create objective to destroy enemy units. 4. Profit?
Also, <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor>
is it possible to create an objective for locating something

have you clicked on the success condition in the editor?
i've just been reading the wiki page
and related crosslinks on the page that say mission editor/dsfahjkf

so things are going well, I have the spawn groups set up to push unit spawns to newly owned / fall back posiitonds depending on objectives etc. but for some reason all the planes are ignoring alt spawn 1 for default and starting on 2 any ideas?
I'm makign a tug of war style map for PVP with PVE components. Each team has 3 air bases and as you loose one your spawns are pushed back to the next one. Or forward to the next. It seems to work fine other than the starting locations are being ignored in favor for spawn 2 at start.
What probability is alt spawn 2 set to?

What probability is alt spawn 2 set to?
90
1-4 is 100/90/80/70

and its only using alt-spawn 2?
yeah without fail
even though it has 4 configured?

even though it has 4 configured?
do you have *any* `force alt spawn` triggers?
A ton, but they don't com into play until either the timer after spawn (2 minutes) or a base is destroyed

do you have *any* `force alt spawn` triggers?
A ton, but they don't com into play until either the timer after spawn (2 minutes) or a base is destroyed
I can tell that it's choose 2 even in the lobby because I set each spawn locaiton to have a different number of available lives

I don't think the triggers can start until the host hits start match right?
oh, these are *players* with alt-spawns?
yea

oh, these are *players* with alt-spawns?
yea
I could try putting the probability of the other spawns to like 1

I am a little confused and hoping someone could help clear up my confusion. How do I design a multiplayer mission? The game officially supports multiplayer now but I can't find an option to make missions multiplayer. Am I missing something?
I try to add a second spawn point and it tells me I cannot do that.
You need to create a new Campaign. There you can toggle on multiplayer.

Oh, can't make single missions (custom scenarios) multiplayer?
You can have a single mission in a campaign
right of course, but was in custom scenario design mode

is there a way to use said map in making a new mission?
you can use it in a mission, but you can't edit it
is there a way to use a map that was used in a seperate mission? im trying to use the nyc map in a different mission

is there a way to use a map that was used in a seperate mission? im trying to use the nyc map in a different mission
Not officially
well damn, looks like ima have to try and remake it myself

Is this your first mission?
You could also ask the creator of that map if they are willing to share it.
no ive made a couple of missions before but they were all very quick'

I know the max player limit for a server is 16, but can you have more slots for players than that in the mission? I'm trying to do something with multiple spawns for different airbases around the map
Yeah, you can have as many player spawn slots as you want.
If you edit the .vts, you can make their starting lives 0 so they can only be used after progressing in the mission

have you had it to where on the enemy's screen they the "mission failed" after destroying a target, but it having not been the actual end of the mission? but their waypoints on the team that received it no longer have objectives, and everyone can spawn in and out normally as if the misison still is live?
nope
well glad to be breaking new ground haha

does anyone know why this is happening?
What are the targets?
players

should something like this work?
yes
Wait, maybe

so should i do total score?
yes
and in the mission options you set how many points kills and deaths are worth

what if i have like 200 NPCs also on the field?
oh, not sure
and i just want to count player deaths

Is that in an experimental branch?
yeah, #public_testing
it will probably be there for a while

Oh and one last thing. Does this count deaths as points for the enemy? Or for the team that its set to.
Because if this is right, that could mean i could count it as if killing NPCs doesnt give points but killing players does
deaths credit points to the opposing team

We are talking about the MP Stats conditions, right? I think it looks at the scoreboard and counts all the listed deaths on that team. So it won't count players that haven't spawned, but I also don't think it will count players that have died then quit the lobby.
alright, thanks for the help
If I have an AI aircraft (F-45A in this case) start cold, and I tell it to vertical take off, how long will it take to get running?

Also, if I command a sea group to move to a waypoint, will they move in formation or collide into each other?
i am once again doing stuff in the editor and i have run into a peculiar problem I have two objectives that both have a 50% chance of beginning. Plan is to have an RTB objective that comes after the completion of the 2 new objectives.  However, because both have a 50% chance of starting in the fist place, how do i make it so that you either have to complete the triggered mission/ both missions/ or just start the rtb objective if neither of the two have triggered?

(not a mission maker), maybe make it so that the RTB only requires 50% off all objectives to be completed?

Convoy 1 is started directly after reaching the waypoint and after it has been completed, Convoy 2 and Escort both have a 50% chance of happening after Con 1

@Sypwn sorry to ping ya, but would you perhaps happen to know how to go about this?
anyone?
One sec

is that last image from a seperate conditional event? The current Trigger for the convoy and Escort are the ones that decide wether or not to spawn them
The last image is whatever conditional checks if RTB should start
(wrong reply, whoops)

so this means that RTB begins as soon as either Obj 1/2 reach Value 2?
in theory this should be able to work now
Alternative method

dumb question, but how do i get to that if else editor?
the fact that i've never managed to spot it confuses me greatly
That's a conditional action. How else are you rolling objectives using chance??

That's a conditional action. How else are you rolling objectives using chance??
are you perhaps avaiable to discuss this in VC1 or something, im still a bit confused
i've tried to do the 2nd method

so as i understand it, is this trigger completely irrelevant now?
and the 50 Roll begins with the completion of the first destruction objective
leaving me in the end with the RTB condition that is triggered once the aforementioned objectives have reached Value 0

how does one go about making said sequencial event?
Events -> Event Sequences -> New Or something like that. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor/Events#Sequence>
everything seems to mostly be in working order now, so finishing up that event and polishing a few rough edges and the mission should be complete

My first custom multiplayer map & scenario! Tug of War - 8v8. PVP & PVE:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2869741013&searchtext=  I worked all weekend on this and I'm pretty proud of it.  A chain of islands where 2 teams fight over control of a total of 6 bases. Kind of like a MOBA were each base has to be taken before the next one.  Offence base Oscar > Defence Base Delta > Home.  Both sides have identical, symmetrical logic programmed into their mission objectives. So both sides have an equal opportunity.  When Oscar is destroyed it starts a chain of other objectives for both teams, the team winning gets a ground sneak attack on their offensive base they have to go back to handle, and the team that lost their offensive base gets the opportunity to complete an objective to launch their navy and carrier fleet.   Taking of the first base allows the team that won that enagement to spawn at the newly taken base, but if their offensive base gets captured they no longer can spawn there. etc.    There are other objectives that happen when triggered like a bomber squadron launching, extra lives per base capture that add up, etc.  Feedback is appreciated. I think I've worked out all the bugs.
Does this need VTOL v1.5?
is this good?

I dunno, I played it Sunday morning. I assume everyone was on the same version due to steam updates?

I dunno, I played it Sunday morning. I assume everyone was on the same version due to steam updates?
1.5 is the version in public_testing that supports looping triggers and respawning units. Impressive to make a tug of war map without these.
No. Conditional actions only fire once, instantly when they are activated. If you want the sequence to __wait__ for something to happen, then you have to put that condition in an entry or exit condition.

Question, i'm working on an even trigger that tells people to stay below 1000ft ASL. once it triggers though thats it, it won't trigger again if they fly below and then go back up. Any way to re-set the trigger so it can be used again and again? I tried set event = enable on a seprate timed event to re-enable the first one but that didnt' seem to help
Once a trigger is triggered, it can't be activated again
As Shadow stated, triggers can't be reactivated or looped.  ...unless you are using the new public_testing branch. VTOL v1.5 finally adds looping trigger support so you can do exactly what you want with a looping event sequence.

okay feeling dumb, where do I put breifing room MP3's ? hah
I tried putting them where the breifing room image is but no luck finding it in editor
EditorResources, same place as the images

Is it possible to edit a map used on a mission WITHOUT breaking the mission?
i made a mission and after bringing it into multiplayer everyone said it was one sided, so i need to add some cover
yeah, that's what repack does

So I have been playing with number of units and want to get an idea of how many total active units you all use in your missions? I try to keep mine in between 80 to 100 for performance reasons. My system can handle more but other players cannot come to find out. Curious as to what everyone uses as their standard?
Not all units have the same performance cost.  Players > AI Aircraft > AI Ground/Naval > Stationary  16 players vs 20 AI aircraft will perform far worse than 2 players vs 200 tanks
thx for the tip

What's the approximate detection range on the opfor Drone Carrier?
Aircraft detecting the carrier? Or the carrier detecting players?
My bad, the carrier detecting players

Aircraft detecting the carrier? Or the carrier detecting players?
My bad, the carrier detecting players
Depends on the player's RCS. I've never used the drone carrier, but it looks like it's based on the DMS Cruiser . It probably shares the same radar, which is much weaker than NMSS Cruiser.

Is there any way to send commands to the drones launched from a drone carrier?
again, never used em. Sorry
If there is, it would have to be though commands on the carrier host

Has anyone seen this before? I'm on Win11
Yeah, I noticed this as well. Use SteamVR for creating and testing missions.
Like Boot Steam VR, then VTOL VR?

Like Boot Steam VR, then VTOL VR?
Oh, for some reason I thought you said you were using the `oculus` launch option. It only happens for me when I do that. Check if you have the oculus launch option enabled, and if so, remove it.
Nope, stock boot options

Is SteamVR launching when you start the game?
No
Ok, then you have to force SteamVR to start somehow.

Is there a way to disable NVG in a mission using a script line in the  .vts file? Want to do a Tornado GR1 mission where there is no night vision capability. I realise I could just trust people to not use it....
Nooooooooope
Hello Editors. Is there a way to assign a task and setting the waypoint automatically? As an exemple. Alpha needs to run the mission objective Air to Air. While Xray needs to go for another objective. That means that when the first objective for Alpha starts it puts the waypoint for the first mission in the MFD for the objectives. A bit later I have a time trigger to make Xray start and go for their objective. Problem is that Alpha now sees the Xray objective. The goal here is that only the team the mission is assigned for sees its objective(waypoint) in the HUD and MFD objective screen. (I know that the other objectives would still be visible in the MFD screen, which is the way it works).

Now THIS is podracing! - 3 new maps pulled directly from the 1999 video game!  After the inspiring work of gandalfnog on the original Tatooine map based on the movie. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2797075913  I thought it would be fun to re-create the game version of these iconic race maps!  The issue with the original map was it had weapons, which turned many matches just into dog fights and the podracing went to the way side. Also it had no checkpoint spawns so if you died you just had to wait the match out.  On my version: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2871110672 The maps, sounds, descriptions, are all pulled directly from the 1999 game. Every turn and visual style replicated using the map creator's height map tool then smoothed out by me.  The only thing I can't do are overhangs and tunnels so you get a lot of canyons.  3 maps:  Mon Gazza - Desert map deep within the spice mines. There are several splits and routes you can take. Some more direct but with traps. Some safer but slower.  Boonta Clasic - Your standard Tatooine race map with canyons, Tusken raiders, obstacles and lots of twists and turns.  Beedo's Wild Ride - A snow map circling the high peek of Ando Prime. As it's white walled you may have issues following portions of the course. Do your best to not run into a wall!

Thats what I thought. Thanks anyhow for replying.

is it possible to turn of the mission editor hud so i can make screenshots of the mission for the briefing? I dont  want my brief images to look like *this*
Use the map editor? The units will be missing, but the briefing images are so small anyway no one will notice.
what about for images of stuff like the AWACS or carrier?

In the public testing branch there is an action to kill a player

Bit of a silly question, but how do multiplayer missions work? I can only make one player spawn, did I miss an option for single player/multiplayer when making the mission or something?
got to make it a campaign
even with just one mission in it

Does this work with old missions too?
as in made before the MP update?
Yes

as in made before the MP update?
Yes
They may be broken for other reasons

Hello, is there a way to stop a long time burning Flare and start a flare with a different color? or do they burn the whole time you set as burn time?
yeah, they burn the whole time as far as i know
In VTOL v1.5 (in public_testing), you can make a looping trigger, which allows you to continually reignite short-lived flares and change the color based on a conditional action or end it after some condition is met.  But in the current stable version of VTOL, you pretty much have to commit to a single color and duration.

Killbox MP coming soon? 👀
Looking forward to 1.5 🙂
Tried killbox in the mp mod and it wasn't the best mp mission tbh

Damn it. i lost my mission. The files are gone. is there any way to retrieve them from Steam?
@Strikeeaglechase can recover if you can prove they're yours
Thanks for the quick reply. i will contact him.

How do I set up multiple player spawns for MP missions?
To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign. 2. Import your mission into that campaign via the campaign editor. 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer via the campaign editor.
Does the same method work with a singular mission?

Does the same method work with a singular mission?
Yes. You cannot make a standalone multiplayer mission, only multiplayer campaigns.
So you have to convert it to a campaign, then convert it to multiplayer.

I'm confused. How do I use a map I downloaded from the Steam workshop? I clicked subscribe, but from there in the game, dunno how to open it
When you go to make a new mission, the map will be selectable from the list of maps
At the veeeeeeery bottom, so it's extra convenient.

i dont half of the buttons??
That's already a mutiplayer campaign
i didnt set up the mission in a campagin

@Sypwn how many units are there in the single sector dynamic liberations?
math
guesstimate

can I select multiple units and make changes to them?

Nope

how many units do you have spawned at one time?
in dynlib quick
didn't you just ask me that?

didn't you just ask me that?
yeah, but you said not at one time
hold on

so some of them aren't spawned right?
It's random, and it involves math, and I'm tired
lol fair enough

Is there way to set diffferent objectives for different groups?
nope
damn

What???? that simple 😛 Nice. Thanks.
question, for something like this, if i set it to enemy units, will a Bulwark, the enemy overlord, be set off by units on B team because they are technically the enemy team? or will it be set off by things on the A team since the A team is the enemy of that unit
"Allied" in this context means Team A

"Allied" in this context means Team A
im trying to make it so where the voiceline "Leans on overlord" is actually forced to happen, instead of what usually happens with the bulwark where it just says nothing

other thing, if i set an event trigger, will that trigger loop if the conditions are meant again? or will it just say the line once and never again
Only once ever
In the next version of VTOL in public_testing, you can make looping event sequences

could anyone help me? my friend is trying to make a mission and he wants to make it dynamic and neither of us know how to do it
If that isn't the hint you need, then you should probably start with something simpler and work your way up.
thank you

would I do that for every one of them?
Every time you need to make something random or dynamic
Here is some of the event sequence for spawning city targets in Sector A. Note the scroll bar. It is very long.

does anyone know if there is a # players check slotted for the next update? The looping function is going to be great for filling in empty slots with AI aircraft, but the "units alive" check is not going to be sufficient if players die.
What's wrong with "units alive"?
If I want to run a looping check to see number of human players, it will give bad values if it checks after a player is shot down and before he respawns

Does anyone have a visual representation of the field of view of the fire control radar?
big cone
just one very large cone

What is that 15 degrees?
Thx
Uhhh 10 degrees I think

Hey, in the mission editor you can make an action in a trigger 'send path to GPS' and then choose a target group#. This doesn't seem to work in multiplayer. I'm not seeing any path in GPS for any of my player aircraft groups. Am I missing something?
That's for single player AFAIK. Some objects you can trigger don't have specific players in mind, those are only for single player. This would also be for triggers that "open canopy" or "launch bar" etc because there's no specific player it references, it means for the single player. How I understand it.
Cool, that makes sense

anybody know why the images I put for the briefings in my missions arent showing up for my friend? they show for me but not for him

uhh how do I get that

@BahamutoD how did this happen?
for some reason only the blufor image is in the example folder
mmn ungh vtole worky game

it had another image in there but the mf just went and dipped?? dunno where hes goin but hes goin
Close the game. Move the correct `IslandsAtWar.PNG` and `IslandsAtWarOpfor.PNG` files into that folder. Replace the vts file with this one.
alright, thanks

Wait, why do you have steam installed into your user folder??
whuh
Whatever. Probably not worth fixing anyway.

what is the sivice celing of the E-4?
Dunno. Experiment yourself, or ping Chase.
Units cannot spawn higher than 33 000ft

what if i make a mountan and plan it on top?
Mountains only go to 6000m
Spawn altitude to 10 000m

so i cant get an extra 6000m?
No
10 000m ASL

is it posible to set a gps mark on the ground and have ai ground usints go there?
Just use waypoints, then use the move to waypoint function within the unit movement
no i want to tell them where to go from inside the mission

Can you edit the health values of units in the .vts to make them harder to kill in a multiplayer mission?
No, but you can toggle their invincibility.
For example, with a group of multiple units, you can make a sequence that temporarily makes them all invincible when one of them dies. This slows down anyone attempting to kill them all.

what does the "weight" do in alternate spawns? say, if one was on 100, and the other 90, what would happen when someone spawns in would they go to the one with 100 weight every time?
I thought probabilities were completely intuitive for you 🤔 `Weight` is how many marbles are in the bag to represent each alt-spawn. Spawn 1 : Weight 100 Spawn 2: Weight 200 means there is a 1/3 chance of spawning at spawn 1, and a 2/3 chance of spawning at spawn 2.
i didnt know it was probability (also, didnt mean to offend with my comment in the wishlist), I thought it was a hierarchy system. Thank you for the insight 😄 👍

Player? They are usually used for AI units to randomize where they spawn.
but no, this makes much more sense
Never used em for players

in what order will players spawn into them, numerical?
so MP Spawn 1 first, then 4 then 5 etc?
Each MP spawn unit represents a separate vehicle slot in the briefing room

so MP Spawn 1 first, then 4 then 5 etc?

ok. So if i chose the top slot, it would put me in the corresponding group at the first available spawnpoint?

Just click the test mission button and see for yourself
It should all make sense

Yes, but are you using steamvr through oculus?
not to matter, i can just upload to the workshop and then playtest in a private lobby
you have to dont you?

you have to dont you?
That's a real hassle
meh i dont mind

what im saying is, its not possible to use vtol vr without it isnt it?
ah i have that
i shall change it

yes, that's what `oculus` mode does

You made the podrace map?
How did you stop people from taking off early?
ok, quick question...  I wanna make a tutorial map for some friends, and I can do most of the things in the mission editor now, but... I cannot make short gifs/videos pop up to explain what to do like in the game's official tutorials.  am I maybe missing something?

The in game tutorials don't have any gif/video's pop up

what do you mean? see if its hidden within the game files?
I can extract that tutorial's vts file from the game files, then see which trigger action it calls to show the video. Then I can try to use that trigger action in a custom mission.
ok, yeah, im not insane.  it'd be nice if it was an official feature tho,

how do you go about doing that?
i can never find the heightmap and vts files of ingame levels for some reason
You have to datamine a bit

What would it compile to?
VTS isn't a programming language
didnt mean compile

Bundle? Yes thats how they are stored
hence the whole datamining aspect
yea thats it

It fails for everyone tho right?
So, if I go ahead and start work on a mission in PT, do you think I will be able to run on feature when 1.5 is release?  I haven't tried this before and I'm not sure the likelihood of an irreparable incompatibility.
It should be compatible

Unless baha radically changes something in an upcomming patch

nooooooooooope
could be weeks, could be months

was there any leaks or hints about the heli before it released?
Yes, tons
there probably aint a new vehicle then

i was editing the .vts file for my mission and was wondering whether its possible to duplicate sequence events. Im assuming all i would need to change is the id of the event so there is no conflict am i right?
Because when i attempted this they dont show up in my sequence events list in the editor. Im assuming its because i havent changed the id of the conditional?
Duplicating entire event sequences? Or just sequence nodes?

Did you completely quit VTOL and restart?
It doesn't load changes from disk until you exit the game
ill do that

How else will people read the briefing?
too true
You convinced me

It plays video sounds too?
holy fuck thats cool
You have to pair it with a play priority message or equivalent, as seen in the screenshot

Did you place all of them manually and edit in the config?
That must take alot of dedication
Yo that's awesome. Definitely using that 👍

Is it possible to setup a mission where players start on the carrier but then when they die they start in the air?
Yes. Use the `Move Spawn` trigger action
Is it possible to change the team of enemy units? For example have an ASF-30 show up as friendly for team A on their NAV map.

No
tragic

Are there any advantages to using the VTS file to create missions outside of the ability to copy paste?
You can do some things the mission editor won't let you do
like putting buildings in weird places

How many units is too many units?
For what? Pref? Dynamic lib has 1000+ spawns with like 25% spawning
In a performance context. Like is there a recommended cap when performance starts to suffer

Depends on the type of unit and what you have it doing

If an air unit is in a group following a path and has engage enemies checked. Will it break off of the path to attack ground targets that it comes across?
Performance cost: Players > AI air > AI ground/naval > AI stationary
specifically ASF-30 against radar/sam sites

hey, if I edit my mission .vts file and change a mission critical player aircraft's lives to zero, will the logic in the game consider that unit as dead? even though it hasn't spawned yet? (this player aircraft will get lives later in the mission though. I want this aircraft to be considered alive, just unavailable until a certain point in the mission)
Always interpret the `Is Alive` condition to mean "Has not died"
 Setting a slot's initial lives to 0 simply means it cannot be used at start, until its lives are increased by triggers.
I may have misread your question, but I think I answered it

How do you convert standalone missions to campaigns?
To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign. 2. Import your mission into that campaign via the campaign editor. 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer via the campaign editor.
how do i make ai land in editor

Curious... Perhaps the dollar sign?
Nah, it seems to empty every time so I hadn't hit save. I thought "if it uploaded first time it would upload every time" but not. then forgot to hit save after filling it in again... stupid me
1 last thing, no matter what i do the stupid budget for B team keeps re setting

did you move this from single player to multiplayer?
ie to campaign?
maybe, took me  awhile to figure out how to even make an mp game

is there a  and B budget line i can add?
ok, what you need to do is make a new campaign and mission, then compare all of the lines to that of your current one to make sure youre not missing any variables
i had to do it with my project, it takes about 20 mins

why do you want them to have a budget anyway?
stop spamram, making a comp 3v3 mission
hm

AIRS-T are disabled as well then?
yeah i cant think of an immediate fix
If your goal is to make a comp mission, limiting budget will mean good players never kill each other with AIM-120s

I've got a KC49 that I'm trying to have land at an enemy airbase. it spawns quite a ways away, then just orbits in place in stead of trying to fly over and land. do I need to get it closer before telling it to land or is there something up with the kc49 landing at enemy airbases?
Did you order it to land using a trigger action?
yes

Did you order it to land using a trigger action?
yes
Does that trigger fire immediately when the mission starts or when the KC49 spawns in? If so, you should change it to have a couple seconds delay.

Does that trigger fire immediately when the mission starts or when the KC49 spawns in? If so, you should change it to have a couple seconds delay.
the trigger action for landing had a 3 second delay after the aircraft spawned in. but the aircraft is like ~50nmi from the airbase
Also, is it a Team B KC49? (Does that unit even exist?)

Also, is it a Team B KC49? (Does that unit even exist?)
it's a team A kc49 trying to land on a team b airbase, there is no kc49 on team b
Oh, AI aircraft will never land on an enemy airbase. (Probably because ATC will never give it clearance.) You could temporarily switch the allegiance of the airbase, but that might mess with other aircraft.

any way to spawn an ai av42 that's already loaded up with guys on a cruiser though?
if not that's not a big deal, i can still work around it
Pretty sure you can spawn in an AI AV-42 full of infantry. There's an extra button in the AI AV-42 unit properties dialog for it. Never used it myself, and I wouldn't be surprised if putting it on a carrier breaks that.

Anyone know why sometimes images I put onto my senarios refuse to update? "No image"
cant get this bad boy to change to "saved"
I was able to fix it by editing the xml manually. weird

is there a way to detect how many players are online?   I want to spawn AI wingmen when there are too few players online, and despawn them if more players join
Currently there isn't a way to check how many players are in the game exactly
The best you can do is check how many player planes are alive with a looping event, and spawn AI aircraft if it's below a threshold

is there a way to "reset" an objective so it can be done again?
No
Well, you could cancel it instead of completing

so the only way to cancel an objective is through an event?
correct
nice

What's the question? And what's a "protect variable"?
how can I make it to where as long as a single unit from a list is alive you still pass?
Use a conditional objective

how can I make it to where as long as a single unit from a list is alive you still pass?
Use a conditional objective
fail condition: UnitList <units to protect> ~~is not all alive~~ num alive equals 0

is it possible to update the available weapons for a player after the game starts ? As in during a re-arming .. ?
No. But you can add slots that have 0 lives at start, and unlock them with triggers. Those slots can have more weapon options.
interesting .. ok thanks

I've got my convoy set to a path, and speed "fast" however they dont seem to move. Do they need to have a road under them or something?
Land units that are in a unit group must be ordered to move with unit group actions.
Default behavior doesn't work once they are in a group, for some reason.

and for ground targets, does railpath work better than path?
assume not or it'll clip through the ground hah
Railpath is deprecated. Don't use it

Is it normal for AI craft to follow a player even if they are not part of their flight group?  I got the mission im working up set up that one wingman will spawn per player that joins, so that every player will have one AI wingman, however when i tested the mission with a friend, the AI did not want to follow either of us until we gave the "form up" command, and when we did that, all the wingmen formed up on only one of us, regardless of flight group.
Never used AI wingmen, sorry :/
is ok. Hoping someone else can help tho

How do I make a multiplayer mission? I can't make a second player unit, so how do I go about it?
ah sorry, found the help post by the ATCBot. thank you
How do I make the player an aircraft other than the AV-24C

How do I create FARP in the mission editor?
Rearm points are a type of unit you can create
thank you!

I have a condition > Unit group:Alpha > Num Alive == 0  > AND  > TeamB kills > 0   This was true after one kill even though Alpha still had players in the air, any idea what I did wrong?
Players don't count for unit groups. Use a UnitList instead
Oh ok, thanks 👍

Does the fire ctrl radar p have the same stats as the fire ctrl radar?
I don't know which, but one of them has more transmitter power (I would assume the fcr P is the FCR2 in this graph)
Perhaps

I’d estimate like 14-18 ish based off of memory i think?
your guess is better than mine
maybe a decent way to measure performance would be deltaV

How'd you pull that off?
Iirc there's a position value in the vts you can tweak that dosn't actually move the airbase but does change where trees can/can't spawn
game updated trees in, then updated them out

problem is, they dont line up in the editor. The names of the units in the editor are MP Spawn [n], how do i tell which one is which?
should i just remove them all and add them back in in the order i want potential players to spawn
If you remove them all, you could break triggers and actions that reference Alpha group. Better to leave at least one member at all times.  They will always show up on the slot list in UnitID order you cannot change that without modifying the .vts. What you want to do is make the unit group member order match that.

What's wpn count? Does it tell you the armament of the player?
you should make a guide on all vteditor hidden functionality
Can you find the independence day UFOs in source code, and if so, can they be called by editing the .vts? Asking for a friend.

i made a map but it won't let the host get in the plane. Any idea of how I can fix that? Map is Day 2 of the Kyushu multiplayer campaign
Wow, you're right. That's a bug!
Which file did you find this in? I need to find the unitID and .vts/.vtc format to spawn a ufo fighter.

Which file did you find this in? I need to find the unitID and .vts/.vtc format to spawn a ufo fighter.
I didn't, that was Red Elite. It's only used in that workshop mission, which I assume is encrypted. You can ask Red Elite for the info, or decompile the game and search for the list of units.

Can I remedy this somehow or are you working on a bugfix for this certain issue yourself? I could try changing a few things out that I've never used before for things I know would work in their stead
Baha will likely fix it at some point, but if you want to look for a work around, it seems somehow related to ASF-30 [208], my guess its unit group/unit group actions somehow
If I had to guess, having the AI aircraft in the same group as the rocket boats fucks up something

@Tyron did you edit the VTS at some point?
Well there's the problem
I didn't edit the VTS, no. But it sometimes happens that units get mangled up in different groups, I had that happen before

What method do you usually use to assign group membership? Selecting it in the unit dialog? Mass-assignment through the unit groups list? Copying units?
Normally just single-selecting a unit and assigning it but for the ones that got mangled I had them copied from an existing configured unit
tfw you spend about 4 hours in the editor and lose everything to a power outage fml

Let's say I want jets to take off with a delay to another group taking off. Would the events look something like this? It didn't work when I checked; Kilo took off 60s after mission launch instead of waiting 60s after Bravo is airborne
Does the bravo group spawn in immediately?
yeah. They are all parked by default

Does the bravo group spawn in immediately?
yeah. They are all parked by default
Correct me if im wrong sypwn, but i believe what is happening here is that for a brief moment when you load in, the game thinks all units are airborne. Therefore, what i would do is change the delay on the first node to 10, 15 seconds. And move the entry condition from the first node to the second

the delay in the top left of each timed sequenced action refers to it being before the entry condition is met or is it after?
I believe before
i may be wrong tho

Silly question but what does the "training mission" checkbox do when creating a mission?
I dont actually know, i think it disables quick saves for singleplayer missions
I feel that Euler has screwed me over here.

Just testing using slanted platforms as a "skirt" around a large raised platform.

How do I make a path that infinitely loops around a given path? Does the loop function do that automatically? And what is a Rail Path vs the normal Path a unit can undertake?
When constructing the path, check the "loop" box.  Rail Path is deprecated. Do not use it. Just use Path
that makes sense. My tanks didn't move, haha :D

Is it reasonable to ask this guy to not call his mission "Dynamic Combined Arms Liberation"?
ehhh
Like, I don't claim ownership of either of those words individually, but please don't use them together :/

@Sypwn so what do you reckon they'd be doing? BTW thnks for response. i seem to have Discord connectivity at present. Previously have 'unable to update Discord', then text loads but images won't (until I disable Kaspersky AV). is all a bit weird - first Oculus wouldn't connect to internet, then (a few weeks later) Skype f*cked up, now Discord!?
If you work for a three letter government agency, then they would theoretically use it to copy data from your computer and otherwise spy on you. Otherwise, they might use it for a botnet.  But it doesn't matter. Just uninstall Kaspersky. Windows Defender is good enough these days.
Also, this conversation doesn't belong in #mission_editor

Whats the best way to make a group of aicraft take off and attack a certain target? set them to take off and in the same trigger add priority targets?
like that?
`Attack Target` and `Set Designated Targets` should both work, engaging the target regardless of distance. `Set Priority Targets` only works if the target enters their engagement range.

will it both work in the same event or do i have to wait with the target designation until they all took off?
`Set Designated Targets` can be set anytime as long as they are alive. They will engage when able. `Attack Target` I'm not sure about
attack target im pretty sure just makes them instantly know where their target is and disregard everything else till they knock it out

does unit that is not yet spawned count as dead if it is in a unit list thats set to trigger if "not all alive"?
if it's waiting to spawn it is not dead
Consider alive to mean "has not died yet"

I can't get ground tanks to follow the path I have set up. Any guides? They should follow at spawn but they dont move
Are they in a group?
A unit group, like Alpha or Charlie

Are they in a group?
A unit group, like Alpha or Charlie
Yes but I want them to travel individually

Could I make them not part of a group but share a path?
Or make individual paths
Yes, but you'd have to issue each individual unit separate movement actions (or only stick with default behavior)

So the only thing I'm missing is that theyre in a group?
Its not too fancy
Yeah. If you ungroup them, place one in each corner of the square path, and set their default behavior to path (with that square path selected), then I think they will do what you want.

will a required objective with no success condition keep the mssion from being completed? a.i., "protect carrier" fail= carrier destroyed, success= none
Yes, because objectives can be set completed by separate trigger actions.
ok

whats the best way to trigger it complete once all other objectives are complete?
Have a GV that increments by 1 when each other objective completes, and when it reaches the right number than that last objective completes.
thats gonna be fun. never used global values

have you ever programmed anything? GVs are just integer variables
nope
Ok then, it's just a number stored and tracked by the game. You can set the initial value, you can change it with actions, and you can check it with conditions.

this menu? dont see it here. im guessing somewhere else
System
ah

and just do that for every objective and then set the protect carrier to be completed once [number of objectives] is reached?
yes
Or alternatively, you could have an objective that fires using "Prereqs". So it only fires once all the objectives before it are complete

also, what do you guys think of having to drop off ground crew at an airbase to use it for refueling? i always thought its kinda weird that we bomb a place to pieces and sudddenly the ground crew materialzes and is  telling you theyre ready
good idea
now i wish we could place and keep infantry on moving carriers. for now i have to make up some story of how they managaed to swim to an island near the AO the day before lol

if i go into the map the mission is using and change something, will it just accept it on the mission folder as well?
That's what the `Tools -> Repack Map` button does. Update the mission with the latest version of the custom map.
So you change it in the map editor, then go into the mission editor and repack.

okay, save and quit mission editor, open map editor, fix it, open mission editor, repack?
exactly
The reason the road cuts off is because it's technically a bridge at that point. You need to delete that last road segment, then add two short segments at the end that are both grounded to fully convert it to grounded road.

Not in formation, no. You can kinda fake column by making them split up and follow the same path independently, but the ships have different top speeds and won't stick together. https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/962116934730678332/1023827513153175582

what are the capabilities of the rocket boat? are they unguided rockets, heat seeking, do they act like artillery?
Unguided. The can engage other naval targets, or ground targets near the shore. They do a significant amount of damage though.

unrelated, whats the max range of the opfor artillery guns/ the trucks?

"if p1 is near p2 or p3 or p4 or p5 or p4= destroy p1" wont work?
Make event trigger with a unit list, then use a `Conditional Action` to determine which units collided and blow them up
there would have to be one trigger event for each possible collision, no?

there would have to be one trigger event for each possible collision, no?
Although I'm not sure if blowing one of the players up will make impossible to detect which other player involved.
with 6 players on each team that 36 events

what is the unit for initial and nav airspeed in the mission editor?

i just realized, this will only work if one team is only hunting and one only being hunted. cus, how are you going to determine who earned the kill?
alright, i have a setup that might work. 4 players each team. 2 hunters, 2 hunted. hunter is F-45 with no equips, hunted is F-26 with a gun.

Fair enough, thank you.

Still no spawning infantry on boats, right?
yes. You can place infantry on a non moving carrier/cruiser or drop them off there with a AV, but as soon as the ship moves they will be left floating

Question about briefings ; is there something in the editor I need to select for a mission to be able to use the nice big defcon room looking breifing room?
The choice of the briefing room is up to the person hosting the mission

got a vague concept/idea for a mission the other day while playing cyberpunk. had the idea of basically making a trauma team mission where you fly the AV-42 around doing medi-vacs. missions would be varying from simple grab and goes to hot LZ's and some sort of idle patrol. anyone got any good ideas for objectives/tasks? imagining just using the training map for it but any other suggestions ill be open to.
Is your HUD/HMCS off at the time?

How can I create Objectives for the opposing team?

There's an option in the objectives tab
Team a and team b

I'm catching up on repeatable actions in mission editor. Can someone pls give me a short description of repeating actions/events. How does it work? How do you configure to get an event/action to fire again.  Pls
Switch to the public_testing branch of VTOL. Looping triggers were only just added in 1.5.0 Create an event sequence. Check the "While" box. Leave the while condition as "true"
Give your sequence's first node an entry condition of when you want it to fire.
Of course your mission won't be playable by the general public until 1.5.0 gets pushed to stable, which could be quite a while at this point.

how do I make objectives optional?
Uncheck the "Required" box in the objective properties
The mission ends in success when all Required objectives are completed, or ends in failure if any Required objectives are failed.

Any way to re-order the objectives? Dragging them around in the objectives menu doesnt seem to do anything. They stay in the order they were created
Activate them in a specific order
(But late joiners will always see them in the order you initially created them)

How do paths work for ground units? I'm assuming they stick to the ground regardless of the height of the path node
iv been haveing an issue where the name and decription of my campain will not save. anyone know whats going on and how to fix it?
AFAIK, yes. Although I haven't tried telling ground units to follow path nodes far in the air...

After playing the mission, search your player.log for the name/id of that AWACS. If something is preventing it from spawning, it should show up there.

Need help. Making MP mission on custom made map. Set default path to a given path. Another aircraft default orbit to a given way point to orbit.   Set to takeoff ready so they’re engines hot. Load in to test. Fly over and the enemy aircrafts have not moved an inch. What am I doing wrong? Spent ages fiddling and nothing!   I haven’t tried placing them airborne as I want the enemy planes to take off as we do.
Set their default behavior to takeoff, not path
Once they takeoff and complete this given command, do they the default to their next command entry? Ether path or orbit?    Also without any given command after take off, what is their default behaviour?

Once they takeoff and complete this given command, do they the default to their next command entry? Ether path or orbit?    Also without any given command after take off, what is their default behaviour?
If they have a default path assigned, they will start pathing it after takeoff
….. I am so upset I didn’t think of this. Genuinely been shouting at myself for the last 2 hours. Sypwn thank you! I will load up tomorrow and set their values correctly.

does this campaign have any other missions in it, besides teh one we're looking at?
it’s one mission and a lot of targets
???

or more options to displaying hints /text than there currently are... is it possible to set these infinitely instead of having them disappear after 1-99999s?
Make it an objective
I wouldn't want popup text blocking my view for an entire mission

hi, i am trying to write a sequence to make an ai AV-42 do a pickup mission (mostly just for fun) but for some reason whenever it tries to take off after the pickup it immediately flips forwards and ends up on the ground on its back, any ideas what is going wrong?
Nap time : ]
well it is 11:30pm for me so almost

Does it follow a path?
no, just take off
with a delay 3 second delay for the next action (RTB)

What happens if you don't have the land at waypoint action?
And does the kestrel flip over immediately after taking off?
lets see

And does the kestrel flip over immediately after taking off?
lets see
yes, will film it this time

how do i report bugs?
make a post in #vtolvr-bugs
ok

How did you get that view in the editor?
good point, it is landing under full AA and missile fire
push insert to get debug camera

Does anyone know why my MP map has 12 player slots but will only let 8 people join a team and the rest get stuck on the team select screen?
that's the limit
theres a slider in the menu with which you can limit the amount of players, the people that can spawn in are limited by the number of player aircraft

are there more than 8 aircraft slots?
there is like 30 player spawn
it just started happening not long ago but before i could have 12 in the lobby

does the briefing room have enough seats?
idk
yeah its the large room with the 2 rows of chairs on both sides like every other mission

Could you put a road there that goes uphill slightly to stop it from flipping forward?
not easily. Im using the default island map. Not up to making my own
I can try and set the waypoint so that it is taking off from one of the existing roads

Is there any tutorial guides for making automatically spawning AI? I want to make AI automatically respawn/fresh spawn in and follow default route/orbit, AFTER certain AI planes/patrols have been destroyed. I think it uses the logic panel but I’ve no idea how it what to use.
only in public testing right now
looping event sequences and respawnable units is what you are looking for

Either that or delay AI from following take off sequence.    Or can I for example, place in editor but NOT spawned in. So the event can be, if unit Bravo is not present they spawn in?
yes. you can check the "respawnable" box on units to make them respawnable. You can already place units but uncheck "spawn immediately" and they won't spawn until you make them
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/1037631734356918312

So with this. In THEORY. I could have many many units at a secondary airfield spawn in under an event action. Such as Bravo Unit being killed? So on so forth
You just can't have killed units respawn
Yes. This is how Dynamic Liberation reinforcements currently work. Many many copies of the same units.

So I can, have BRAVO unit spawn once ALPHA is destroyed.   Then CHARLIE unit spawn once BRAVO is destroyed and so on. That would be how to do it, correct?   With entering commands. I would leave default behaviour as take off and default path to the path I want them to fly and the newly spawned in unit will follow these like normal?
Yes, exactly
Put all that in a single Event Sequence.

How do I do this? I had a brief look but it intimidated me. Tried Google but direct video to explain it
Nevermind lol already said it
Not near a computer right now or I would send you a screenshot

hello fellas, ive been working on a map which is intended to be open world with the random encounters mod.   I have an AWACS and tanker setup to be flying around the friendly area of the map and they both have different paths set, but no matter what ive tried, they both stick to the same path and orbit right next to each other (which makes refuelling unnecessarily difficult). does anyone know what the issue could be?
you need them to be in different groups, otherwise they will try and form up together
didnt think of that :o

do the event sequences delay timers start right away or do they only start once entry conditions are met?
I would think the timer starts first then does the entry check once the timer runs out right?
Delay -> Entry condition -> Action -> Exit condition

I would think the timer starts first then does the entry check once the timer runs out right?
Delay -> Entry condition -> Action -> Exit condition
If you want a delay **after **a condition is met, then you need to put that condition in the exit condition of the previous node

Dumb question but i wanted to be sure when you upload a map to the steam workshop do you update it the same way? By uploading the same missions just new ones
> Dumb question but i wanted to be sure when you upload a map to the steam workshop do you update it the same way? Yes  > By uploading the same missions just new ones What?
Ah sorry about that me being bad at English

But thanks

so how does a sequence work with nodes vs actions?
👆
each component is optional

so why would a taxi action be getting skipped?
Nothing is skipped
ok, why would it be taking off wihtout taxiing?

ok, why would it be taking off wihtout taxiing?
what's "it"?
an AI av42

is there a way to force it to?
dunno
never tried

there are no time stamps, it this oldest first or newest first?
oldest at the top
search for the name of the unit, or the name of the sequence node

is there a way to make infantry act normal when under fire not just stand there?
Are they set to engage enemies? Are there nearby enemies they can shoot at?
yes and yes but they just stand there

Are they set to engage enemies? Are there nearby enemies they can shoot at?
yes and yes but they just stand there
They won't take cover or nothing, but they should be shooting

will tanks with engage set but stop to engage unset shoot while moving?
yes
cool

anyone know if the gav-25 has a twr limit for vertical takeoff?
I believe the TWR requited for all VTOL AI is 1.1
thanks. thats why they haven't been taking off then.

Can anyone confirm for spawning in enemies.  Alpha unit. spawn immediately. Bravo, DO NOT spawn immediately.  Event as follows, entry condition: Alpha number alive 0=output.  Exit condition: Bravo All Alive=Output.  Doing this will spawn in Bravo units once ALL Alpha units are dead, Correct?
Your entry condition is correct, but your exit condition makes no sense. You'll want to use an action to spawn bravo, not a condition
So, Remove conidiont and add action

That will then spawn in Bravo under the condition Alpha are all dead?
Yes
Once again Sypwn you have saved A LOT of swearing 🙂 appreciate it all!

Question is, any idea why the rest of the server doesn't hear the audio?
most likely this logic only runs on the host, and the sound isn't synchronised
do not quote me on this, am not multiplayer mission maker

Me again.   So I have two enemy airfields that are set to become ours once we destroy X amount of enemies for repairs and re-arm...  How will I stop the newly placed spawn-in enemies from spawning there once we take control of alpha and bravo base?
use a Global Value
or, stop the reinforcement sequence when the airbase is captured

Can you link a "how to" guide on that?
there are no guides
Because simply put, ive copied the units changed names and set them to spawn when their counter part units all die and follow the set commands, take off/default path etc

and it's all handled in one large Event Sequence, right?
have a global variable like: "Basecaptured" set to 0, and set it to 1 after its captured. Global variables are in the same category as scenario info i believe
you can use global variables in conditions

So in objectives, under completed event, New action Alpha respawn=Stop sequence. and this stops ALL event sequence of the preset I have for respawn?
So sorry I'm not the best at explaining
> So in objectives, under completed event, New action Alpha respawn=Stop sequence Yes  > this stops ALL event sequence of the preset I have for respawn? As far as I understand, yes

> So in objectives, under completed event, New action Alpha respawn=Stop sequence Yes  > this stops ALL event sequence of the preset I have for respawn? As far as I understand, yes
then post screenshots instead of text explainations
everyone loves screenshots

what does the follow behavure do on grounfd units?
not sure
oof

oh, and another thing I am curious about with the current pub test. Lets say you have a large enemy group and half of them have been killed. If you have the entire group force respawned by an event, does it just respawn the dead units, or does the *entire* unit list/group get respawned in it's entirety? (creating even more units than were originally spawned.)
only units that are dead will be respawned
noice

Will this work on multiplayer too?
Only for ai iirc
Hmmm

i cant get this convoy to move on the rail path for the life of me lol any ideas why they wont budge?
iirc railpath is a discountined feature, just use regular path mode
sorry i made a path I've set them to follow the path and there fucking stood there

yea then not sure, take a look through your logic and if you dont notice anything send an image i guess?
fuck it im off to bed haha will try tomorrow
thank you dude!

is there any simple way to modify the default missions? say for example I wanted to play some of the F26 campaign as an F45, some of the F45 quick missions as an AV-42, etc
Yes but requires some work/extracting the game
Not quite "simple". You have to extract the asset files with AssetRipper, then convert them to .vts files.

How do alt spawns work so i want the helio to spawn on a fob base after we take it do i have to put another spawn on the position?
Don't use alt-spawns for that. Use the "Move Spawn" action
Alt-spawns are primarily for randomizing the position of AI units

do flying units always have to take off in order to be airborne or can i spawn them in the air?
i tried to spawn them in the air and set a path but they never got there
did you give them fuel and an initial speed?

did you give them fuel and an initial speed?
yes you can spawn aircraft in the air
this is my convoy atm... they wont budge

were do i make these actions?
thank you
like this?

awesome so they should move now?
if i want to make this convoy bigger now can i just copy the units?
will they all take the same action

if i want to make this convoy bigger now can i just copy the units?
will they all take the same action
Yeah, as long as they are in alpha group

well i give this ago and if i get stuck again can i give u a shout?
thanks so much for helpinf dude! im such a boomer when it comes to this shit haha
Just ask your questions here in this channel.

Hey everyone!  Looking for a bit of help.   If i create a path like this, is there a way I can trigger it to be set as a route on the nav screen?
I.E by hitting a waypoint trigger
I'm not sure, if I want to create a "route" I'll just normally use a load of waypoints which I then connect to objectives which only activate once the previous objectives are complete

Me again...  So, after we take say, Alpha base and it becomes friendly ally base. How can I set this as a new respawn instead of the initial FOB airfield?
use the Move Spawn trigger action
you can put it in the complete actions of the objective to capture the airbase

Can I not move spawn for Unitgroup? I assume I will need to add MP spawn to that location or does it make me place new spawn after the event trigger
> Can I not move spawn for Unitgroup? No. That would move the entire unitgroup into one spot, so everyone would spawn inside each other, lol. You'll want people to spawn in different hangers or helipads or whatever.  > I assume I will need to add MP spawn to that location No. The Move Spawn trigger makes you set a new location through the trigger
To the left of UI.. Thats the new spawn?

Purple smudge orb
yeah

Does the headig not follow your orange radar thing on the editor with the arrow for facing direction?
what orange radar thing?
That

Sweet jesus. Okay next one. How to reference curser heading, is it in 360 compass value? For example 0 is north 180 south etc?
because the Move Spawn action was quickly added in 5 minutes in response to AH-94s being otherwise unplayable in Dynamic Liberation
Yes. You can see the current cursor heading at the bottom of the screen.

is there a way to change player spawn points? or is that just for AI
Scroll up. That's the conversation I just had with Ducky
awkward. thanks

For a cleaner lobby look and story line  is it not possible to do it the way I mentioned then?
If it works it works I’m happy! Just tidiness of story line and lobby appearance that’s all
I'm not sure

Help. I just deleted a custom campaign I have been working on. It wasn't uploaded to steam yet. Any ideas if I can retrieve it somehow?
do you have any back-ups? like file history?
I'm just trying a system restore to see if I can see the campaign folder is back before I open up vtol again

Enable limited lives for that helicopter slot. Go into the .vts and change the initial lives to 0. To unlock the slot, grant it 99 lives or whatever with a trigger.

I am trying to access the debug camera, but when I press the insert key nothing happens. Can someone help me?
You need to make a pilot named "devcam" and use that when you test the mission. Also try pressing shift-insert. Sometimes only that works for some reason.
IIRC devcam is only necessary in mp

That worked, thanks a lot! Also, is there a way to skip the team selection screen, so I don't have to put on my goggles everytime?
Only by converting the mission back to singleplayer.
I created Dyn Lib initially as a singleplayer mission, then converted it to MP once all the mission logic was done and tested. The ability to remotely kill units and fast-forward in the devcam are also exclusive to singleplayer missions and super useful.

Okay, how can I convert a MP mission to a SP one?
Create a SP mission and add one player spawn. Create an MP mission and add one player spawn. Open both .vts files in Notepad++ or equivalent and study the differences.
I used AI aircraft to represent the other players while I was working on the mission, then manually converted them back to MP slots when I converted the rest of the mission. That way I could program in all the triggers that reference them.

SO. to set a Bravo base to spawn in nonespawned AI AFTER Alpha base has been taken.. do I just begin event sequence bravo base start with ONLY a new action " Spawn XXX unit "?
objective finish events
event sequence to begin after alpha base is taken

So the secondary photo is fine? it will begin event seuqence and follow the action " spawn XXX unit "
and then any spawn unit sequence after will active once XXX unit is dead
If all you're doing is spawning those units immediately, you can cut out the sequence entirely and spawn them directly from the objective complete action from the previous base

So having both an event sequence AND obj complete action to spawn, will not cause any problems?
What you have in the pictures will work fine
Thanks ❤️

Hey, I'm making an absolutely amazing rescue mission. How do I get the infantrymen to get into the airplane when they land?
Is the AV-42 a player or is it AI?
they will end up being AI. It's for multiplayer.

Is the AV-42 a player or is it AI?
they will end up being AI. It's for multiplayer.
You have to use an event action to tell the AI to pick them up.  You may first have to tell them to land nearby. I haven't used pickups myself yet. @ISEGaming may know more.

Having both the ship and jets set to spawn in with either objective finish or even sequence, this will work like an airbase correct?
Yes. Although you may want to delay the spawning of the aircraft for a second after the carrier spawns. Otherwise there is a race condition where the aircraft sometimes won't spawn.
How do I delay? I assume thats in the event sequence for "spawn unit group "?

How do I delay? I assume thats in the event sequence for "spawn unit group "?
Split it into two nodes in the sequence. First node spawns the carrier (and other ships) with no delay. Second node spawns the aircraft, but set the delay to 0.1
Like so?

First carrier spawns and jets 0.01 after.. once first jets are numberalive=0 carrier 2 and secondary jets spawn in. That is correct I believe?
I've added 0.01 to second jets to prevent issues
Wait, so the second carrier just pops in once you kill the first set of aircraft??  Why not make them all spawn in with the planes parked, and have the second set take off when the first are destroyed?

Or wait for 1.5 when you can respawn units
Trying to keep performance up which is why I went that route. Which would be better?

Trying to keep performance up which is why I went that route. Which would be better?
they have roughly 15nm to cover before they get to where friendly will be
Stationary units don't use much performance

Okay! I will give it a whirl! But for future big big missions, what I had was correct for it to work?
Appreciate it!
For future big big missions, use 1.5 unit respawning as much as possible

*reads* looks like you guys explained the whole Player AV-42 picking up Soliders to @udjason?
_me again_  If I place ASF30's on the same flight path as an enemy AWACS.. will they convoy or will they fly off and leave the AWACS?
what is the range of the mpa155

_me again_  If I place ASF30's on the same flight path as an enemy AWACS.. will they convoy or will they fly off and leave the AWACS?
what is the range of the mpa155
~26km on flat terrain

question, does the mission editor have a trigger for hitting a specific waypoint with a weapon of any kind?
nope
you could simulate it probably

whta is the firerate of the mpa155?
uhh
It's fairly quick

isnt a salvo a shot?
No
i want to know the how long it takes for the pice to shoot and then shoot agian

if i set a desingnated target to a group will a mpa155 attack that target?
Yes
same with priority?

will it stack the bodies of the targets?
I read too quick sometimes
i read quick all thre time

If you set it to attack a group?
no if the arty pice in in a grou and i give it a priority target as a group
Yes the whole group will fire

Will they return to formation if they destroy enemies? I want them to convoy and protect the AWACS
Yeah
Sorry, the AWACS is enemy AWACS, being escorted by X3 ASF-30's

Can I set Enemy Sam Radar to respawn after being destroyed? Or do I need to set up alternative radars to "spawn in" after the primary radar is downed?
Don't think it will work for new actions "spawn unit" after it is destroyed
In VTOL 1.5.0 yes. I'm the current stable version no

Does anyone know of a way to create a timer that increments every second without using the 1.5 features?
using 1.5 features is a way
I will show myself out

Only using a timed event or sequence with 1s delay. For what purpose do you want this?
i was going to create a timer that counted down from 10 minutes, but i realised i could just use a 10 min delay for timed trigger
I was going to ask, why do you need one second increments?

I was going to ask, why do you need one second increments?
But it sounds like you have it figured out
I dont, but now im curious if its possible without the looping triggers

may do in the future?
HS will probably never support triggers or AI, because of how complicated the code is for that.
Does chase have to write it himself?

Does chase have to write it himself?
yeah
makes sense

I think ive already suggested this, but how cool would it be to have an AI in the HS that uses machine learning to get better at beating people?
I would have to entirely write the AI and the physics
For PvP, most of the data is just players updating each other on who is where and who is doing what. HS simply forwards that data between the players. It doesn't even know the full state of the game.  Triggers and AI are both processed exclusively by the host, then the result is sent to the other clients. The other clients don't help with it at all, so HS would have to do that. Chase can't just steal all that code from VTOL, so he'd have to write it from scratch.

I'm trying to add a capture base to my campaign but I'm not sure how to go about it. Is it under BASE, Targets and then set team? It's a little confusing as to what constitutes taking a base.
That's how you set the initial team. You can change the base's faction as part of on objective's Completion Action
where might i find that in this menu?

where might i find that in this menu?
That's it, you got it
Sorry, I thought you were asking about the Base's tab on the right side of the editor

how does the weight in alternate spawns work, is it a percentage chance?
because if i leave them all at 100 if always chooses the first available spawn
if they all have a weight of 100, then there is an equal chance of rolling any of them

does sync group affect anything?
because i seem to be alwasy spawning in the same place
IIRC is object A has a weight 1 and object B has a weight of 3, the object A has a 25% chance of spawning

How would one properly tell an AI AV42 to land, pickup soldiers, and then take off again?
also what is the difference between Land at Wpt w/ direction and Land at Wpt w/ dir facing?
Land at wpt is just land at this spot. land at wpt w/ dir is land at this spot and when you land you need to be facing x direction

also what is the difference between Land at Wpt w/ direction and Land at Wpt w/ dir facing?
Land at wpt is just land at this spot. land at wpt w/ dir is land at this spot and when you land you need to be facing x direction
Do alt spawns work in mp spawn class?

Do alt spawns work in mp spawn class?
I think so, but they're only rolled once at the start of the mission.
You need looping triggers to properly randomize player spawns.

are looping triggers possible now?
In the 1.5.0 PTB
how do I make an alt spawn weight 0?

how do I make an alt spawn weight 0?
I want to make checkpoints so players that die dont get left behind
Do I just make it 1, hope they spawn in the right spot, and then force the spawn once they've reached the checkpoint?

Do I just make it 1, hope they spawn in the right spot, and then force the spawn once they've reached the checkpoint?
just use the move spawn action?
thats a thing?

just use the move spawn action?
thats a thing?
oh

in objectives what is per kill reward?
there is no points in vtol
and also what is full completion bonus??

and also what is full completion bonus??
ayyy
or is it just kills counted to the players stats?

or is it just kills counted to the players stats?
Those rewards are all about ingame $$, only really useful in singleplayer campaigns.
ahh

Can you get to the mission editor without a headset on hand?
Yes there are buttons on screen when you first launch the game
Yes

are there people who make missions for people? i acc suck at it terribly
Not really. But if you detail what you're looking for, and the idea is appealing, you might just inspire someone to make it.
what is this

how do i get pre planned GPS points?
There's an event action under System -> System. I think it's called "Send waypoint to GPS"
okay cool thank you

What kinder mission you after?
WAIT. So I don’t need to add rearm stations to the hangers…? Once we capture their bases we have access to them?
Is it possible to spawn an enemy multiple times?

WAIT. So I don’t need to add rearm stations to the hangers…? Once we capture their bases we have access to them?
Is it possible to spawn an enemy multiple times?
In 1.5 yes

Is it possible to spawn an enemy multiple times?
In 1.5 yes
and for now?

any idea when 1.5 is coming to stable?
I guess thats up to baha
Yeah baha probably dosn't even know

can anyone tell me how to sett the aircraft im using?
So I'm guessing you're trying to get all of them to take off once one of them takes off?
Yeah that’s right. Both AV are meant to take off when any of the 4 player vehicles take off

So I'm guessing you're trying to get all of them to take off once one of them takes off?

Pinned a message.

Sorry, So now that the AVs take off loaded with troops the next event is land at WPT                 but it seems like the AVs are just orbiting a waypoint which is the last event in my sequence?

An airborne AI's default behavior if it has no other active orders is to orbit its "Default orbit point" if one is set in its unit properties, or orbit its spawn point if not. Could this be what's happening?  As for why it has no other active orders, check your player.log. Not only is the firing of each event sequence node logged, but issues with AI orders are often logged there as well.

To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

is this how the sequence is meant to work? do i need to add entry/exit conditions too all the nodes to properly time the events?
Oh yeah, actions in VTOL are never blocking.
If a sequence needs to wait for something, there needs to be an entry/exit condition

Im having trouble making ai f45s engage enemy players. They have weapons and are set to engage. Is there something im missing?
Fuel?
were it so easy

Can they still detect them without it?
No if you have them with radar off they won’t engage with fox-3s. They will shoot fox-2s when they get super close
Does tis apply for enemy AI, set radar OFF and they won’t use fox 3?

Does tis apply for enemy AI, set radar OFF and they won’t use fox 3?
Even if they’re armed with fox 3’s.
Correct

I am trying to make it so that a MAD-4 radar and launcher truck moves after it launches a missile. What would be the best way to create this behavior?
You can't detect when it launched a missile.  You may have to first tell the radar to pack up by turning off "engage enemies"
what is meant by "is detected by enemy team"?

what is meant by "is detected by enemy team"?
does that count rwr detection from a player or is that only when it shows up on nav map?
Not for RWR

does that count rwr detection from a player or is that only when it shows up on nav map?
Not for RWR
(replied to wrong comment)

While I have you here do you mind talking with me about how the vehicle control events work?
I notice that you can use conditional triggers to detect when certain switches and such are interacted with in the cockpit
I actually have to go now, sorry

When I complete objective it starts objective B.  Under the start it will begin Event Sequence as shown. This will work correct? I dont need entry or exit conditions.  It is a naval carrier and x10 jets. Jets are on a 0.01S delay as suggested beforehand
Had an issue with spawn enemies so simplifying step by step to make sure it works
yeah

_Ignore location_  Once spawned onto carrier, they will automatically take off and follow given path, correct?  My understanding is,  this will work.
they should
Can I run two nodes in an event sequence, using the same entry condition " Unit A num alive=0 "

you mean in 1.5? in VTOL 1.4, unspawned units are always considered alive, so repeating an alive check like that is pointless
It's for separate nodes to spawn carrier and then jets in 1.4
what's the point to adding that condition to the second entry condition?

what's the point to adding that condition to the second entry condition?
I assume if I want the node to activate I need an entry condition
Or will it activate from top and begin going downwards once node 1 entry conditions are met, therefor making node 2 entry condition pointless/not needed?

Or will it activate from top and begin going downwards once node 1 entry conditions are met, therefor making node 2 entry condition pointless/not needed?
no
delay is optional entry condition is optional actions are optional exit condition is optional

Can I restrict weapons at different airfields? I want to make an aircraft that can't spawn with any weapons and has to go somewhere to get them
Yeah, but the player will have to manually switch between planes in the lobby
You can do that by limiting the amount of lives a spawn has

_is_ there a way I can make myself invincible in MP lobbies I host.  As I make and test missions among my friends I wanna be able to fly about freely and see what is taking off and what unbits spawn in etc.. so is there a way I can make myself invincible so I can monitor and watch how the mission develops?
I don't think you can in the editor
You may be able to in .vts

Why do you need to be flying around, why don't you just use insert camera?
What's insert camera?
devcam

I thought you had to name yourself "devcam" as well?
yes
Oh ok

Are you going to run the HS and the BFM thingy on the same lobby or 2 different ones?
HC?
Headless client

Can you not have this conversation here?
Trying to test a mission and discord won't stop chirping
kek

do you have pings on in such a way that you get pinged whenever someone types in this channel?
yes
ping

is there anything other than the static crashed av42c that emits black smoke?
I built a PvP Strike Mission for AH-94 anyone wanna help me playtest and figure out bugs and test functionality before I release?
can you make a black flare?

how to you spawn a flare?

can you make a black flare?
how to you spawn a flare?
LOL

how to you spawn a flare?
LOL
it's a trigger action, I think under System -> System

that cannot be much to ask for?
you can probably hide the crashed av42 under the ground to just get the smoke
I hide them under trees and put them on top of ATC towers to make them look like a blown up S?A

I hide them under trees and put them on top of ATC towers to make them look like a blown up S?A
S/A
but black flare should absolutely be a thing with no light emission. I just wanna spruce up some target cities with some visual interest and make it a little more obvious where the fighting is happening

Does anyone know if you can actually record the voices for wingmen yourself in missions, or is that still limited by the selection available? Thinking about making custom voice lines for a mission; but for wingmen, as well as for the story.
not for wingmen normal interactions (evading missiles and such)
but for specific events you can use custom radio chatter

@Joshua Marston did you rename or delete the original map?
No just update it
open the VTOL game directory 1. Inside the CustomMaps folder should be a folder with the name of your custom map (`map000_firstmap`?). Inside that folder should be a .vtm file with the exact same name (`map000_firstmap.vtm`?) 2. Inside the CustomScenarios folder (and then inside the Campaigns folder if it's a campaign) should be your custom mission. Look for the mission's .vts and open it in notepad. It should say `mapID = map000_firstmap` or whatever the actual name of your custom map is.

Does anybody here know why campaign names and descriptions arnt being saved in game but are being saved on the workshop page?
There's a known bug where clicking "save" sometimes doesn't save campaign name/description changes for some reason.

Hi there, It seems we can only set a 'destroy' objective on an enemy unit. Does anyone know if it's possible to set a static object as an objective ?
use a conditional objective
hmmm ok... haven't found this yet 😇  Can you elaborate ?

hmmm ok... haven't found this yet 😇  Can you elaborate ?
oooooh I guess I'll go to sleep a bit less stupid then
thanks 🙂

is there a way to open the mission editor without having to put on a headset?
yes
Main menu bottom right@Velocity Raptor

why wont my GPS targets show up in game? i sent waypoint to GPS for each waypoint and none of them show up
this is what i have
Is that a multiplayer mission?

Is that a multiplayer mission?
The waypoints are only added to GPS for players that are alive at the time it's fired. You have it firing at 0s after mission starts. Player are still fading out from the briefing room at that time, so no one is in their vehicles to receive it.
You usually need to wait 2-3 seconds to wait for the fadeout, but even then it would fail if a player starts the mission without picking a slot.

Next question what is the max height for either the Sam Missiles or Radar?
There’s not really a max height
Generally both radars and missiles do better against high targets

Could I fake it with logic?
fake what?
Is HC live? seems like website is down

Is HC live? seems like website is down
It never was up
oh

so how to setup HC?
It is not open to the public either
oh ok i see

@Sypwn, was it you who said you had a sizeable collection of dedicated servers?
I mean could you also like just have them on different ports?
and then use a proxy like nginx to forwards the different domain names to ports

I mean could you also like just have them on different ports?
and then use a proxy like nginx to forwards the different domain names to ports
For my services I do, and I have it behind nginx so I can map different domain names to internal services

Would you be breaking terms by running them simultaneously?
ahhh so the issue isnt ports but rather how many VTOL VR copies you have
yeah VM is probably the best solution to that

does HC and HS actually *rely* on the VTOL executables or is that just a restriction you made for copyright reasons?
Also we should go to #off-topic before Sypwn wakes up
fair

Just to confirm. If I set enemy AI with radar OFF they wont have use of Fox3's?
it seems unlikely that they can use fox3s
(Sorry got distracted yesterday) fake a max radar range or angle if possible

Hey! I'm making a mission which has a couple of hundreds of very similar objectives. The scenario then selects a random set of 9 of them. It's a pain to make all the objectives in the internal objective editor, but would be easy to copy and past in a text editor. 1. Any caveats with using an external text editor? 2. Is the vts file format actually conforming to some common file format which could be recognized and highlighted by a code editor?
The vts file format is a glorified .txt
You can use any text editor to edit it

Why don't you have these grouped into a single "6 selected" number alive check?
Honestly, its a personal choice, its better for me to understand at a glance. I do it alot in Engineering projects. Yes it would be cleaner to have 6 but ehh
Hey! Is this a bug? If I cancel a selected objective with "Cancel objective" action it stays visible on the objective screen. Pressing prev and then next on the screen removes it.

Hey! Is this a bug? If I cancel a selected objective with "Cancel objective" action it stays visible on the objective screen. Pressing prev and then next on the screen removes it.
The objective should change to a red colour on the objective screen. But a objective will only disappear if there is another objective after it.
Red color is for failed ones AFAIK.

Is there a convenient way to decouple workshop item description from in-game campaign description? I want to make a more in-depth description on Steam, but it does not make sense to have that in-game. So far the best option I can see is uploading with VTOL and manually editing the description on Steam, having the detailed one saves somewhere on GitHub.
Yeah. I just have a better description on steam
@Sypwn ok im here how do i do it

how do i make it so the round ends after a specific amount of enemies have been killed?
AI? Or players?
Players

does anyone have a spreadsheet with all the costs of attachments? just to give a feeling of how much budget to give
im sorry to ask this but how do you make a enemy team player? i cant seem to spawn a player for the enemy team
Did you create the mission as part of a multiplayer campaign?

Hi everyone, what does this option do in the editor?
It means when the objective starts, all present players have their NAV points set to the selected waypoint.
I doubt it. Maybe @Strikeeaglechase . But few people touch that feature.

i also got 2 small questions that would be a lot of help for fanciness 1. how do i give players GPS coordinates. not waypoints 2. can i make an enemy blind/dormant? there is the "engage enemies" checkbox, but i dont believe that affects cruiser radar/SAMs?
> 1. how do i give players GPS coordinates. not waypoints It's an event action under System -> System. (Send Waypoint/Path to GPS?) But know that in MP it only affects players that are spawned in and alive when it activates.  > 2. can i make an enemy blind/dormant? there is the "engage enemies" checkbox, but i dont believe that affects cruiser radar/SAMs?  Yeah I think that's a bug. I need to report it. There's also the "Set non-targets" action, but that can be just as buggy.
1. ah, okay that explains it. so i have to set up a trigger to like 5 seconds so that they get it?  2. sad. i know that for the mobile ground radars (only mad 4 i guess) it is meant to not close in on enemies while still having the radar going

> ah, okay that explains it. so i have to set up a trigger to like 5 seconds so that they get it?  Yeah. Because players are still fading out from the briefing room for the first couple seconds, and some people don't pick their slots right away.

If I want to have a take off objective with allied group conditions, will it require the entire group for a true outcome or just however many of that group is spawned in?

Group conditionals usually start with  "Any..." or "All..."

so is not alive can also mean not spawned?
thanks for the help!
Only for human players in MP, yes

Unfortunate

I seem to be having a problem with enemy ground units not following the path i set does anyone know what could be causing this?
If the units are in a group, they will form up and follow the leader ignoring any other orders given.
You have to give them group action orders, or ungroup them

so any units that I want to patrol a path cannot be in a group correct?
They can, as long as they are all following it in formation
ok thank you

okay that works then XD I think for the simplicity of it will it work if i just dont set them to any group but have each convoy unit set to follow the path?
Each approach (grouped or ungrouped) has its pros and cons. You'll just have to experiment with both and decide what you think would be best for your needs.
Ok once again thank you for your expertise I'm going to be testing the "finished product" today and would be honored if you could join me

@BahamutoD or anyone else have a TL;DR explanation of exactly how units decide where to join a looping path?
If I had uploaded a test version of the mission/campaign to steam is there anyway to update that with the final version or do I just have to re-upload each version to the workshop
I can feel the frustration radiating off this post

is there a way to move spawns?
there's a Move Spawn trigger action
il look into that, thanks

is it possible to launch the editor without launching the game/VR?
yes
how do I do that?

how do I do that?
Start the game and it should be on the bottom right
That starts my VR, any way to do it without VR launching?

use the `oculus` launch option

Hey! Objectives have  "Completion reward" field. Do I assume correctly that it should add score to the team score but is just broken for now?
It adds to team (or player) budget but i dont think money currently works to limit what players can equip (might be wrong)
so... since I cannot despawn infantry, is there a way to make infantry disappear without killing them? specifically, this is for a mission I wanna make where the infantry has to go inside a building, and obviously.... they cant just be standing out there, outside the door. they actually have to go "inside" the building and not die.  so... help?

IIRC all units can just clip into a building
oh O_O I mean, that works...

i come to you again with another random question  is there any way to make an enemy plane carry an anti ship missile?
No
damn, what a shame

how "stupid" will the AI go when i set a designated target? will it only evade missiles and otherwise beeline the target? and what if i only set one of a group to do so? will the others follow them? (maybe thats a good time to ask how the AI determines wing leaders by default)
pretty much what you said
if its a formation lead aircraft, the following aircraft will go with it

and im guessing the AI just determines the "first created" as the lead? also, if the lead got a designated target, will the followers break off once you get close to them?
i think its the first assigned to the group
Group membership order is determined by the order you add the units to the group. You can see the current order here. (In this case, 12, 13, 11, 10)

hmm... that might be worth integrating into the story... and i got just the right place for them to try... whats their range?
it's complicated
oh no

WAIT i didnt have to set the waypoint/path of the entire group, just the leader this entire time then??
yeah but why would you not command the entire group
its way easier

how do i do this? i got their path set and now i want them to shoot at the carrier once they are at the final waypoint... im guessing its not "set priority target"?
For rocket boats, I think "Set priority target" is the best you can do
maybe you can place rocket arty on a carrier and it maybe wont slide off XD

do you know how many problems that would solve for me?
i am weapons to surpass metal gear
When I tried that with a carrier group they all phased into each other and followed the path single file instead of staying in formation

Now are they able to shoot?
How do you Inter developer camera I couldn’t get it to work lol
I guess my insert key is broke

@Strikeeaglechase do carriers and allied cruisers have something special that allows them to move ground units while carrying them?
yes
they have a moving platform component

don't suppose one of the other smaller enemy vessels has them?
very unlikely
idk why not, its not like its really an optimisation

boats use special net syncs right?
yes
They use the downloadData same as players iirc

Why do you care so much about the AI anyway?  Your workshop doesn't appear to have any non-test VTOL missions
what do you use all this knowledge for?
oh you know

what do you use all this knowledge for?
oh you know
*also airtraffic, random encounters, ai tweaks, ai debug*

but for what? or who? do you have a portfolio of CSA missions you've made? It's just odd to make all these tools for others when you doesn't seem to have a goal of using them yourself for something. Not trying to imply anything, I'm just really curious about your motivation.
my skillset includes writing code, my skillset does not include being good at level design
fair enough

I hear we have unit respawns now? Is this true?
in vtol 1.5, yes
you can currently access it through the public_testing branch

I've got a question. What exactly needs to be done for an objective to show up for a player? I'm trying to set an objective to reach a checkpoint, and so far have it trigger on proximity and set a new spawn location, and it works when I fly in the mission, but I don't actually see the objective pop up.
Do you get the objective in your objectives menu?

In game
I don't get it there no

Are you looking for the "new objective" popup at the top of the hud?
You should probably have the spawn movement be handled by an event rather than a trigger
like am I looking to have it pop up for the player? not necessarily, the only thing I care about is that you can see the marker on your HUD.

like am I looking to have it pop up for the player? not necessarily, the only thing I care about is that you can see the marker on your HUD.
The new objective popup only happens if the objective is created during gameplay
The Move Spawn action should be inside the Completed Event actions for the objective. No need for a separate triggered event.

OOOOOH, you mean the waypoint?
yea yea
you need to check the "Auto-set Waypoint" box in the objective

in completed event action of objective editor?
yes
right now I just have it enabling the trigger

is there a way to set specific enemy units not to be targeted without making them force undetected?
that's what I'm saying, skip the pointless extra trigger
"Set non-target" action?

so is the waypoint separate from the objective? Like do I need to still put the checkpoint in the exact spot as the objective for it to be a waypoint or will the objective be a waypoint in it's own
No, the objective waypoint is the center of the trigger
I think that's what you're asking

Are you trying to decouple the visible waypoint the player sees from the actual place they have to go? Use two different waypoints for them?
No, but they are two separate things so I was wondering if I could just skip the waypoint part
but as you've explained that's impossible

except if its a player? I think there's bugs with setting players as non-targets
Not a player
I'm curious, is there a list of planned features for 1.5 available?

I'm curious, is there a list of planned features for 1.5 available?
Planned, no. Already implemented? See the pinned messages in #public_testing
Baha very very rarely announces any future plans.

Planned, no. Already implemented? See the pinned messages in #public_testing
Baha very very rarely announces any future plans.
So now I've got another question. How do I make another objective become the waypoint for the player after the previous objective has been completed? It's not as simple as enabling Auto-set Waypoint is it?

So now I've got another question. How do I make another objective become the waypoint for the player after the previous objective has been completed? It's not as simple as enabling Auto-set Waypoint is it?
As long as the objectives fire in sequence (using prerequisite objectives or such), then yes it's that simple. If multiple objectives are active at the same time, then moving waypoints between them gets complicated.
ok so if I have 2 different objectives that are set to Auto-set Waypoint, do they both show up as a waypoint or does it pick one or the other?

ok so if I have 2 different objectives that are set to Auto-set Waypoint, do they both show up as a waypoint or does it pick one or the other?
the one that was activated most recently overrides the previous one
but players can anytime open their OBJ page and click the WPT button to set their current waypoint to any objective's waypoint, even if you didn't check "Auto-set waypoint"

so how do I trigger another objective to start once the previous one finishes? it doesn't seem obvious from the available actions in objective events.
set objective 2's Start Mode: Prerequesite
then check the box for objective 1 as the prereq

Is the mission count as complete once all objectives are done?
Once all __active__ and __Required__ objectives are done, yes.
If there are no active objectives at the start of the mission, it won't finish. But if there is at least 1 completed objective and no currently active required objectives, it completes.

is it possible to clone/duplicate a mission?
File -> Save As
just spent the last 4 hours making a simple mission, really gave me an appreciation for Dynamic Liberation lmao

Any kind of pattern with what aspects you don't like?
Usually the end goal is boring
Stuff like "Clear airbase to win"

Is there a way to force units in a sea group to spawn in their formation positions?
whoops bad reply
place them in their correct formation positions?

place them in their correct formation positions?
But uh, on that topic, you could simply copy the file
they always drift and I cry

So how does formation work for a group of 6?
1 23 456  I assume
It's always a V

how, without just removing and readding?
It allows a trigger to happen *every* time an event occurs, instead of only *the first time* an event occurs.  Every time the player goes above a certain altitude, something bad happens. Every time they respawn, they are invincible for x seconds. Every time they approach a friendly convoy, it resumes moving. Every time they fly away, it stops.
The possibilities are pretty insane

Does stopping  a timed event sequence pause it or stop and restart it?
I assumed stop and restart
stopping a timed event or an event sequence makes it impossible to resume or restart

This won't be the case in 1.5?
1.5 allows an event sequence to loop back to the beginning when it hits the end, instead of stop.
But that's it. Still can't restart dead sequences

How did you do that so fast? Was this already built?
or you could do this and give the objective a success condition of hold time == 30
I already had the 1.5 editor open, but otherwise no I'm just quick with making triggers 😛

If you already had it planned out I'm sure you could do it in a minute but on the fly? maybe not quite
also I didn't actually fill in the condition trees lol
Bruh :wkek:

Has there been any hint of text-from API in the mission editor?
what?
Advanced Programmer Interface, like proper scripting with text and copy paste so I can work faster and make less mistakes than I do dragging my mouse around from checkbox to checkbox

I mean are the base .vts files just default Unity serialization of the CustomScenario class? Cuz if so, moving it all to json might not even be the best move to make, for editability and all.
I don't know. Are the default unity serialization plain text?
Just go make a new scenario and look at one, lol

I don't know. Are the default unity serialization plain text?
Just go make a new scenario and look at one, lol
To be fair I also wrote a C# version

Because that's against the TOS?
Well I wouldn’t have put it on GitHub
Only reason that vts to json exists is I needed it for HC and figured it would be useful to other ppl

eta on mission editor update is like ? this spring or sooner than that?
there is no eta on anything, lol
ah man baha just needs to make the game more expensive its like giving a bunch of people a crack addiction and then not supplying more

with a proximity trigger on it as well?
for units to spawn for the encounter
im confused on where to put the chance in the logic is what i think im asking

oh for fucks sake they dont?
that explains a lot
is there a list of broken and working shit

Also, have you played shazmode?
I havent ever had a private MP experience
idk what shazmode is

Shazmode is in this campaign: <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2793994908> Dynamic Liberation AH-94 (and AV-42) only No enemy aircraft Clearing a sector moves your spawns to the next one
yucky ucky 42
pubs hate the 42 so no worries

Fly 60 minutes, get nailed by a random hidden manpad?
The other problem with realism is that we have magic IFF and no civilian faction.
more like fly 20 minutes and get shot down if your stupid

Has baha everattempted team work previously? Or hes just not open to it
I believe he's stated that he's not interested, and doesn't enjoy it.
And I can respect that

How would that work? Baha would basically have to open source the unity project lmao
well instead of making it a skill issue, work on the process so its easier for someone to create a custom unit or aircraft
like

My biggest question is *how*? What could be done to make it easier?
You literally just described CSA
yeah CSA makes it relatively easy for ai units

Has anyone actually asked Baha about that?
We've mentioned it a bunch of times without baha saying anything
:/

How would that work with things like team score and objectives tho?
oh wait hc doesnt support objectives anyway
nvm

Anyone know why I can’t see my custom mission/campaign when hosting an mp lobby? It’s set to multiplayer, I have spawn points and can launch the mission fine within the editor. I’m subscribed on steam and it’s installed but it doesn’t show up in the campaign selector when hosting a lobby
Quit the game, verify files, try again
Ok I’ll try that out

Are there any AI cruise missiles?
Some might classify the NMSS's SuperMissile as a cruise missile. But if you're asking about a big honkin missile that you can order AI to fire at ground targets, only the AGM-89/161 and only from Team A.
Ok so a "Vampire slayer" mission in which you have to kill a bunch of incoming anti ship missiles would have to be performed from Team B it seems

Do the order of key-value pairs in the `.vt*` files matter or will it read them in any order?
I assume they aren't required to be ordered
Nah order does not matter

or do you mean you can't find it in game?
I managed to find it

is it possible to have an MP spawn where if no one spawns there, a bot would spawn there?
you could pull that off with triggers
place both a player spawn and AI there, check if that player "is alive", if not spawn the AI.

so I just gotta hop on open beta and my mission will still work?
Otherwise it will only work the first time and never again
yeah thats what I assumed would happen

Im saying its not gonna break anything that is already in the game? I know ill have to update the radar logic
It should be fine
where is ptu changes pinned again?

where is ptu changes pinned again?
nvm

another question, what does enabling engage enemies do on the AEW-50 Bulwark. Does it provide BRAAA callouts for REDFOR? or does it make the AWACS lock up targets
uhhhh, I don't imagine it would do anything
yeah confused

does it have a "Radar Enabled" property?
yes
It launches fox 3's

What happens if you give an AWACS an Attack action order?
idk what happens
Im charging headset rn and building REDFOR CAP

REDFOR AI doesnt have a FOX 1?
I think they have one you can equip
nah, i think its just the heatseeking and semiactive radar missile, i cant remember their names ever

do you know which is which?
LOL yes
you got a fun mnemonic so i can remember them or something? XD

you got a fun mnemonic so i can remember them or something? XD
yeah, SRM stands for short range missile (IR), and MRM stands for medium range missile (FOX3) although MRM could probably be renamed to MRMSAR if Baha were to add a FOX-1 for REDFOR AI
then you would have MRMAR for FOX-1

also, I know there is a way for AI to prioritize targets. Does that queue in a priority list? example: GAV-25 takes off pathing to target A. when it gets to the end of its path it triggers enable engage for the GAV to prioritize target A. Then a player is detected by the GAV-25 and that triggers another prioritize target PLAYER. Will the GAV add the player to the queue or break off from its attack to intercept a player and then return to its original strike?
If you use "Add priority target", it will add the player to its pool of priority targets it can choose from. If you use "Set priority target", it will clear the pool of priority targets, and then add the player so it goes after that.
set priority target is what I need for the player proximity trigger then?

set priority target is what I need for the player proximity trigger then?
If you want it to break off at a certain point to attack the player, then resume attacking the original target, you'll need to use an Event Sequence to order it around
and I can use Player Is Not Alive to return him to his strike targets?

and I can use Player Is Not Alive to return him to his strike targets?
yeah, but once you Set priority target it will completely forget about attacking the previous target, even if the player is dead
okok sequence it is

set priority deletes the queue of targets, add priority targets adds it to the pool of targets it will attack, what does set designated and attack target do thats different?
priority targets will be attacked when they are spotted by normal means designated targets are revealed to that AI so they don't need to be spotted, and will be attacked regardless "attack target" overrides all other orders and they will attack a single target (then revert back to previous behavior when done)
okay so I need to use designated targets and attack target orders to have GAV-25's harass AH-94 pilots

attack target reverts to previous behavior which could be designated targets? so I could cut out the looping sequence?
okay so now my issue is making it individual per player. I dont want the GAV's to set attack on all players. Just the one or two that are getting too close
can I make a node for each player that will work independently or do I have to make a sequence for each player that could interfere with the GAV flight?

clicking "respawn able" means when the unit dies it automatically respawns?
I would guess so, but I've never tested mixing them before

I would guess so, but I've never tested mixing them before
The simplest solution is to make a sequence for each player, unfortunately. It is possible to do it single sequence with a Conditional Action, and a GV for each player, but that's probably more clicks.

is there a way to turn on collisions between aircraft? i feel like it was a thing at some point, but in my missions there are none
It is in singleplayer. But not in multiplayer
ah, thanks. thats what i was worried about

so where is the action to respawn when dead? Im having trouble finding it
Im going to loop for redundancies sake now
yeah per player seems like the most straightforward way

testers? more like testes amirite
No tester role so dosn't count
Baha plz

is Unit Group Is Any Near Waypoint broken?
😩 so many questions LOL
If the UnitGroup has players in it, yes. Use UnitList if you there are players involved.

are timed events repeatable if they are looped by a sequence?
also is there any way to have a flight take off and have it randomly pick between lets say 3 different looped paths. Once it chooses a path it runs that circuit until it detects an enemy aircraft. If it wins against the player, it returns to its circuit, if it get shot down it respawns, takes off, and the dice roll for choosing 1 of the 3 paths happens again
how the hell do you direct infantry to load into an AV-42C I think im blind

is there an issue with Player AV-42C's loading and unloading infantry or something?
could've sworn I once upon a time had an infantry group load into a vehicle all at once
idk if im just being stupid

always wondered how default behavior StayInRadius works, anyone know?
If the AV-42 are piloted by players, you have to create "Pick Up" objectives for them.
No

What do you mean exactly?
Normally you just need to complete all of a mission's required objectives
Dose completing all objectives pull up the end game panel?

Dose completing all objectives pull up the end game panel?
all objectives marked as required yes

another one from me, default behavior "takeoff" used on an aircraft does what? Do I have to build a taxi path for all AI aircraft or does the default behavior just autopath to whichever runway is closest?
they handle taxiing themselves
unless they are VTOL capable, in which case they will just take off straight up

so gav-25 requires a taxi path built if you want it to STOL?
after taxiing, they will follow their default path, or orbit their default waypoint
you don't need to build any taxi paths  If they are are on an airbase or carrier, and their TWR is too low for VTOL, they will automatically taxi to the runway for takeoff.

and what is that TWR?
Thrust to Weight Ratio  Heavy aircraft can't take off straight up because too heavy
You can see the TWR for AI aircraft on the equip tab

Lower fuel and loadout until it's.... 1.2 I think?
okokok
GAV-25s are suuuuuuuuper fuel efficient. The ones in Dyn Lib spawn with like 20% and flying from sector C -> A consumes less than half of that.

does a unit require engage enemies ON if I send that unit priority targets will it still engage them?
I want a UCAV to engage ground targets with its ATGM's but I don't want it to get distracted by players
Priority: yes it requires engage enemies on Designated: dunno "Attack target": no it will ignore engage enemies setting

ok but will the drone get distracted and attack players it detects even if it doesnt have its gun?
drone won't attack anything if it doesn't have a weapon, lol
As I understand it, for each type of target (air, ground, naval, stationary) the game has a list of weapons that are "highly effective", and a list of weapons that are "less effective".  AI will freely engage targets if they have a "highly effective" weapon against that target. So a fighter carrying a MRM or SRM will engage any hostile aircraft it detects, if engage enemies is on.  An AI aircraft will not always (not sure on details) engage enemies if they are only carrying "less effective" weapons against that target, but still can be ordered to attack that target manually.  An aircraft carrying unguided bombs won't normally attack a moving ship, but will if you set that ship as a designated target.

i guess slightly under 2.00 is realistic?
How do I change callsigns
Assign the players to a group

How can I set the target of rocket artillery in the mission editor?
Use a trigger action
Thanks

Can *single player* have it?
I’m probably just blanking
Wait…

Is it possible to measure lives left for a specific unit in the conditional editor?
I thought there was a condition to check remaining lives...
It checks for the whole team, and can't be used to measure a specific player

@Sypwn when Im sending a GPS point via system. Target Group is what? the GPS group?
Anyone interested in playtesting a PVE Vietnam War multiplayer map I've been working on?
Don't know. Test it and see what happens. Honestly I thought you would have done that by now instead of waiting for my answer.

Im just messin around, I need more time to test

People ask me "How are you so good with computers?" or "How are you so knowledgeable about the mission editor?"
Me:
I push every button and flip every switch to see what happens, then put it back together when I break it.
fuck I consider testing each gameplay mechanic I want to add but same time most of the conditional logic and event sequences Im doing are making the AI slightly more intelligent.  Honestly a Mission Editor Handbook wouldn't be a terrible idea especially with specifics like Unit Group has issues dealing with Players etc.

how the send waypoint to GPS trigger's "Target Group" property works?
That would be better to put in https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor/Events
Some of the features pertaining to 1.5. Ig we need to do more testing to see whats possible though...

Is looping removed currently due to the first node skipped bug?
No, looping was reworked (at my request) to be less confusing. To make a sequence loop, use the new sequence "Restart" action.
I could kiss you

Of course the real reason I pleaded was because the ol' `while` method would have turned this #mission_editor channel into a madhouse of "Why won't my sequence work right?" x8365
Restart only restarts the node or the entire sequence though?
entire sequence

(it should, not actually tested yet)

is this what convinced Baha?
part of it, yeah
programerless behaviour

where tf is it? Im in PTE and Im looking in system
but, actually, I feel like the standard is that the programmer words have to mean the things they do, because thats how most level editors work, cause most level editors were made by programmers
if thats actually how while worked, used to work that is a bit silly

anyway to make mp missions for friends without uploading them to steam workshop? tried putting them in everyones customscenarios folder but they dont show up when hosting the mission
you can upload them and make it unlisted, that way only people with a link can see it
i think then i would still have to have mission content follow the rules of steam workshop

hmm well disregarding that part, if multiple people work on the mission, everyone of us would have to upload it themself yes before anyone of us can playtest it?, are there issues with beeing subbed to multiple missions with same name/etc?
wtf are you uploading lmao
:FloppaFlushed:

does workshop content have to be compatible with the base game, or can they be mod compatible only?
oh, is it just copyrighted music?
yep from bakrus

oh, is it just copyrighted music?

thats fine lmao

is the music even an issue?
wasnt there a version check when you join a server?
🤷‍♂️

you can do addition and subtraction now, is that not enough?
You can't add GV to GV
you can only add constant to GV

Where do the new spawn slot labels show up?
even if you did do what I was thinking, the number of 'ticks' required to do it would mess up everything
And I'm not just waiting for a pipe dream. Baha teased the most awesome thing but hasn't added it yet

Is there a char limit for the descriptions?
30
30 I think

remove the library and re-add it?
unless you install everything to the steam directory of course
restarting it worked this time, I was too fast to complain

@Sypwn are you going to be updating dynlib with the new 1.5 features?
or did you already do that
Some of them. I'll add slot descriptions and loadout recommendations real soon. For the trigger stuff, I'm not sure yet.

Does anyone know of a way to count the number of active players in a match?
Unit List (select all players) Num Alive
Sorry I should specify

Next question: can AI still jump over edges if their path goes through it?
Here for instance, would it jump from the ground to the platform?
I think it will vertically displace up to a certain limit. Although maybe not if it's an overhang like that.

is the recommended just a standard equipment layout upon enter a vehicle slot that they can change?
yes I should add a quickload kit for each spawn then
yes but the equipment is already on the hardpoint

does anybody know the distance of the mpa-155s arty fire?
very big
no clue, you have to find out by trial and error

Before I go insane, is this really the only way to do this?
It's taken me ages, even with file editing
These are relatively simple as they are a single action

Why did you have to do this 8 times?
For each individual player
if(playerX > radius) -> Murder them

couldn't you make a sequence containing only those 8 actions, and restart *that* sequence each time you need to restart them all?
use sequences as functions
That's what this is yes

yeah, but I thought you were complaining about having to create 8x8=64 restart actions?
No, just the lack of foreach loops
oh, yeah welcome to VTEdit

is it event sequence logic?
Yes
Conditions run BEFORE I spawn

have you looked at your player log?
I have done extensive enough testing that I've ruled it down to timings
I can get around them, with timers specifically

Is there a way to set the position of a carrier? I'm trying to randomize where the players carrier group spawns at
you can use alternate spawns, no?
with the new update is it only sequence's that can be reset because i cant seem to get triggers to go off more than once

Correct. But sequences can take the place of the other trigger types.

@BrianAnim we just tried to play podrace and it's all broken - No countdown at the start - Spawn points don't move - No enemies at the top of the canyon - "Someone has won the race" (I think it was supposed to say who?)
I'm new to mission editing and I had a pretty basic question I couldn't seem to find when searching online or on here... How do you designate units and bases to a specific team? It doesn't seem like Enemy is Team B, but rather the AI enemy faction? I'm trying to make a PvP mission and this is really throwing me for a bit of a loop....
If you want it PVP you need to make the mission a multiplayer mission first

Then you can assign AI to either side

How do I assign AI to a side?
enemy units are team b
thats just how it is

So then if I wanted to have AI jets for Team B, they would use the ASF's?
yes
and Team B can use enemy bases while Team A can use allied bases?

and Team B can use enemy bases while Team A can use allied bases?
yes
awesome, thanks for the help!

I don't suppose there's a way to make an AI hostile to both sides?
nope
Dang... I was really hoping lol

what about for static units like Radar and SAMs? I want to try and create a trigger that'll have them swap sides
noooope
Noooooooo my idea.. lol

Is there an easier way to set an objective that requires you to stay in a zone for a period of time to complete? For example, you have to fly inside of a 5 km radius zone for 10 seconds before completing, but if you fly out of it, it resets the obj timer. The only way I can think of is chaining together delayed triggers, wasn't sure what the  best way to do this is
no but you can decide how long before an action is triggered in a sequence. Example: you could have a Pick Up mission for AV42C. The mission only completes once the troops are loaded. Now create an event sequence that tells the Troops to board the AV42C when it is landed and within proximity of a waypoint but delay it for however long you want a player to remain landed for + the travel time of the Troops pathing to the AV42C and loading. Then the objective will complete
In a part of the map far away from the campaign, you could spawn an infantry when player near waypoint, set the infantry to move a certain distance to an objective, then have when infantry at objective then: insert command. Having the infantry respawnable and killed when the timer is up

So I made a few hours of changes to a mission I've been working on this morning. I don't know what happened but I closed out of Vtol and left for a bit. When I came back and loaded up my mission in the editor none of my updates seem to be there from the changes I made and saved today. however I uploaded my changes to the steam workshop and it all seems to be there and okay. I've heard there's a way to retrieve your own missions from the workshop and convert them back to .vts files etc to pull up in the mission editor. can someone help me with that so I can get the changes I've made back into my mission files on my end?
@Strikeeaglechase

So I have this certain mission and many people can't figure out that a requirement in the mission is to stay low, what action can I use to warn individual players flying too high they are about to have a bad time?
put "DON'T FLY ABOVE ROOFTOPS" as the slot description for every slot
Im glad im not the only using slot descriptions as an alternative to briefings

Do you think that's sufficient?  Many people don't read text unless it's right in front of their face.
And the slot text is in front of their face
it will be in front of their face, many many times

is the "throttle" control message applied to the collective?
nvm "combat collective"
Those dont work in MP IIRC

Are running tutorial messages applied to new joining clients?
no
You can run a loop and detect when people become alive then show the message later (and as I learned yesterday, with a wee bit of delay)

wouldn't the result be idiot messages for everyone then?
You can do it for every individual player
You can do it for each *slot*, but not for each player

first off, how did you get these audio files?
recorded them with audacity
ok, are you using BGM or comms actions?

What is the range of the mad-4 radar? I want to make a path for the AWACS, but I don't want it to get too close.
success condition
55km but it will ping, spike, and range targets beyond that

Instead of setting the Loiter Begin Objective action, why not set Take Off to be a prereq of Loiter?
also 55km is arbitrary it all depends on launch parameters
right, I'll just put it about 70 km out.

Maybe something's up with your Loiter objective, I don't have much exp yet in this so don't take my word for it, but everything looks fine. Do you complete or fail the mission after take off?
complete
if I continue the mission all my objectives after take off work correctly

is it a singleplayer mission with forced equips enabled?
yes that would be why wouldnt it

more questions: is there any way to change the limited equips mid mission? like have an event where player completes and objective and as a reward unlocks the ability to use certain weapons
@Sypwn you can re-alive slots right? cause if true, you can have slots that are limited and slots that are not
and then give a live to the slot you want unlocked

@Sypwn you can re-alive slots right? cause if true, you can have slots that are limited and slots that are not

Wish you could limit equips based on the rearm point instead of the slot. Then you could have stuff like FARPs be able to equip less than a full airfield or carrier

How long does the smoke last on dead units?

How do I rasie the spawn off the ground

scroll wheel (or is it ctrl-scroll or something?)
or enter a new altitude in those boxes in the bottom right corner of the editor
then once your editor cursor is in the air, move the spawn point

make it a team B player spawn
Where is that option

do we have general range of the agm-89 fired from surface level?

I think that's @drmedwurst275's map
Update is great - but can someone give an example where the respawnable option would be used pls. I wanted to have 'enemy' leave buildings - move on a path towards another building - and assuming the player didn't kill them they would then enter the building they have run to. Destroying them leaves a body on the floor. Is the above possible now - and does the new respawnable option enable the above scenario. Thanks.

Here I am with another question 🙂  How exactly do I set up a proper loop?  For context, here is the purpose for the loop:  I want ally aircraft to respawn at the airbase after they have been shot down. same for enemies. if they get shot down, there will be a 60 second cooldown, they they respawn and take off and head to battle.  currently I have that much going using the event sequencer. I set he event sequence to "start immediately" and the delay to 5 seconds just for testing purposes. as I remember, I set the ally aircraft to be spawned in at mission start, and the event sequencer just checks if the ally plane has been destroyed or not. the entry condition checks if it's alive. if its not, I set a "spawn" event followed by a "restart event sequence" event, all in one node.  however... when the ally plane dies, they spawn in IMMEDIATELY, without any delay. The delay timer doesnt seem to do anything in the event sequencer.  am I doing something wrong?
Can you screenshot the sequence?
Yeah, definately. gimme a moment to grab it

Can you screenshot the sequence?
Yeah, definately. gimme a moment to grab it
The delay occurs before the entry condition

ooohhhhh, I see... So I kinda gotta make it a 2-node sequence then. the actual spawning and restart will be in the second node, and the first one will be, for all intents and purposes, the "delay" (so to say0, cos it'll wait for the exit condition before heading onto node 2?
yeah that's one way to do it. Put the entry condition in the first node (leave the rest of it empty), and keep the delay on the second node
you can add to budget through events and stuff, but can you subtract from enemy budget?

you can add to budget through events and stuff, but can you subtract from enemy budget?
would be cool if you could have PvP missions where blowing up a strategic target caused the enemy to be less capable due to budget shortage

I have a quick question, so i tested my mission out and when i got to a certain objective it completed the mission even though there were still  3 objectives left, and i put them all on required, does anyone know what could be happening?
Did the required objectives show up on the MFD page at the time the mission ended?
yes and no, when the mission ended no other objectives were displayed until one of the aircraft i made triggered the next objective

Did the required objectives show up on the MFD page at the time the mission ended?
yes and no, when the mission ended no other objectives were displayed until one of the aircraft i made triggered the next objective
which then showed up

when i click on the link it is the "what are alt spawns?" paragraph is that the one you are refering to?
oh the wiki is weird, scroll up one line
okay

it also says that if the enemy completed their objectives but i havent set any up for them could that be a problem?
The player.log spits out a block of text every time it checks for mission completion. That might be useful to look at.
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

does anyone know exactly how "infAmmoReloadDelay" works?
okay thank you
does it reload only once it is all empty or periodically

where are the insert cam controls pinned again?
Are you just copying the text in the darker section? ```%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR```

thx

so what do i do with player log?
that...shouldn't matter
search it for the last appearance of `Final Mission Completion Check Routine`

how do u want me to upload?
drag it here into the discord window then press enter
magic

did you just restart the game and open the editor?
it was a little bit ago
yeah

The objective titled "Fly to waypoint" is completing, and there are no other objectives active at the time. It looks like you're starting another objective "Destroy enemy AA" immediately after, but it's too late. How is that second objective being started?
I just added this paragraph to my FAQ > Be careful to keep a "Required" objective open at all times until you want the mission to end. The intended method to do this is to use Prerequisite Objective Start Types, so that completing one objective immediately starts another. You can also put an Objective -> Start actions inside another objective's Completion and Failed actions section. Or you can have one "Required" objective that sits in the background for the whole mission, and is completed only at the very end.
It is being triggered by the waypoint proximity of the Fly to waypoint, as soon as they get in the proximity of the trigger, the next objective starts but then it says mission complete

so there is a separate proximity trigger that starts the second objective?
Yes, the fly to objective has its own proximity detecter and then i have a seperate one to start the next objective
but that prob isnt neccessary now

Does the Alt Spawn is rerolled on each Respawn?
no
you have to use a Conditional Action of Chances and Force Alt Spawn actions to re-roll it manually.

I want to make my mission multiplayer and I have it in a campaign how do I add another player spawn?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ>
literally the first question

what file? what folder? I'm talking about the campaign editor
ok I'm good now
we can't call them that anymore

Do you also live in my walls?
||redacted||
is there a way to make some infantry load into one players aircraft and others into another as an objective?

is there a way to make some infantry load into one players aircraft and others into another as an objective?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#av42boarding> You select which infantry should be loaded as part of the objective. You can split that up however you like.
ok so 2 separate objectives with different waypoints

@Sypwn what does the Start Immediately checkbox do?  if its not checked the event sequence has to be triggered before an entry condition can be met yes?
if its not checked, the sequence won't do anything until it's started by another action
ok so it works how i thought it did I was just having issues with some of my sequences starting too early

oh, because you have to restart the game so frequently?
yeah
though I think I figured it out I gotta change the value AND the minimums to allow for negative values

> I have it set on a per life basis Shouldn't you need to set it to per team basis then?
I haven't messed around with the budget stuff, but as I understand per life mode means the budget resets every respawn.
it does

is the moderator role really worth our pain in the editor?
lol
*the tester role sure is* 👀

oh god are we turning this into the modding channel too, where there is no topic?
*absolutely*
we should stop, I enjoy this channel

Can someone please tell me how i create a Bullseye Point for a Multiplayer Mission?
its in scenario info in the mission editor
you create a waypoint, call it "bullseye" or something

what's going wrong? Log shows sequence restarting and all 3 nodes firing, but message 1 never reappears
Try making the duration of the first message ever so slightly slower
like 1.9 seconds

put my dummy node (no actions) back in at front and sequence works properly again - get msg 1 then msg 2 then msg 1, msg 2 etc etc. I'm surprised this hasn't been picked up before. lots of people have been using Restart in sequence  unless it is some weird situation with system actions one after the other in sequence?!
@Sypwn just seeking advice pls and noting my earlier misameanor "Did you just completely ignore what I told Monarch directly above?"   I'm happy to put things in VTOL Issues, but what's the difference between a bug and an issue? Is #public_testing reserved for issues (bugs) related to the most recent release? And thread vtolvr-issues for other issues/bugs ... just asking.   I have identified 'issue/bug' with Restart - see last few posts. I guess it should go to  vtolvr -issues2
Interesting. This was actually a bug in v1.5.0p16 (one of the testing builds) that it would skip the first node after restart, but that was fixed for the release, and I haven't had any problems. I won't have access to VR until sometime tomorrow.  If you make a new blank mission on Akutan and just add a player spawn and that sequence, does it still happen? If so please make a new thread on #vtolvr-bugs and include that mission's vts file.

I want to copy a multiplayer mission I have for the same campaign. Namely a dogfighting mission, one with guns and the other with guns'n'heaters. How do I copy it correctly because just changing the folder and file name replaces the other mission in the editor?

duplicate the physical folder
then alter its name

It that something easily figured in the editor?
🤷 I normally don't use the editor maybe @Scralar knows
Aight I'll keep my eyes open here. Cheers dude

its my first time playing around with the ships movement in formation, anyone know a way to get them to move in formation without having to make a path for every ship?
@Sypwn
You can assign them all to a group, then order the group to move to waypoints, they will move in formation if you move them via unit groups

Is there a way to randomise music that plays during a mission? Just a random thought, but... I think it could be an interesting to do in some non-story based missions or pvp missions.
Use the "chance" condition to play the music
wait, that works on music? And a bunch of songs set at 25 percent wont try to... work against eachother?

This screenshot uses the old While loop format. @Lazy You have to use sequence restarts now <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#sequenceloop>

It still works tho doesnt it?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#uploadfail>
if the box was already checked, yes. But otherwise the box is not present to be checked.

Did that FAQ answer your question?
Testing atm
Yes, it helped tremendously, thanks again

did akutan and simple 3 node sequence as suggested  and it worked fine!! went back to my original and it worked fine as well ... go figure. Your reference to fix in v1.5.0p16 might be the clue. I hadn't played VTOL for while and software might have been pre p16 then subsequently updated? I checked this time and i'm now p19. Is there a list somewhere of the p releases and dates? I can only find 1.5.x updates on steam. thks for assist!
you shouldn't be on p# anything right now. You need to switch to the stable branch.
1.5.2 is out on stable

Why? I've been on PTB for about 3 years. is there particular reason I should switch?
Because ptb is currently out of date. The 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 fixes were never pushed to ptb. Also, you never play multiplayer??
Oh didn't realise Stable was passed PTB - I'll change. Played multiplayer on my own when first released to see what it was like ... each time in somebody just shot me down - no warning no messages no nothing. Haven't been back since - might think about it again.

Is there a way to modify a mission found on the workshop?
If you are the mission creator yes
otherwise you have to ask the creator for the files

How do you enable the Gunner Seat in the Mission Editor for the Apache?  "Select the MP spawn in the editor and set the seats up to 2" Is that Slots or am i trippin bc i aint finding sth called seats
thanks
Did you create the mission as part of a multiplayer campaign? I'm guessing you made a singleplayer mission instead.

Did you create the mission as part of a multiplayer campaign? I'm guessing you made a singleplayer mission instead.
yes
To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign. 2. Import your mission into that campaign via the campaign editor. 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer via the campaign editor.

Looking at the other channel, it had alt spawns before? Perhaps you hadonly enabled the second seat on Alt Spawn 2?
I'll take the silence as meaning it's fixed.
yes but now i cant load in

Other players? So you're hosting this for real, not just testing from the editor?
No
I've seen this before...

what VR headset do you have connected? This log doesn't seem to have any
Now I see why you have "bug hunter" I'm your bio
💀  Oculust Quest 2

And you're trying to select your slot and stuff in VR, right? You can't use the mouse in the briefing room.
mouse? from pc?
nah that not there

Was this log was taken immediately after you got stuck?
Or did you, like, restart the game after that
I may be reading it wrong, but this long only appears to have you starting the game, opening a custom mission in the editor, and nothing else. Nothing to indicate you tested the mission.

Anyone got a minute to help me with some mission editor basics? Im trying to setup what I think is a fairly unique version of a strike mission but Im new. I would love a mentor to hop in voice. Here is a sneak peak!
you should probably be using the weight function built into alt spawns
I thought that'd work.... but then the fighters also just choose one single alt spawn and never ghoose any of the others ever again 😦

Are you forcing alt spawn and spawning them all within the same action block? You should separate it by a tiny delay. Force alt spawn, delay 0.1s, spawn units.
Also to create an even 3-way split with Conditional Actions you need to make the conditions: If (chance 33) Else if (chance 50) Else
my power went off so im gonna have to try it tomorrow, but I did take some screensgots of how my setup looks

did you find the fix to this? i have the same issue
I need someone to provide their player.log file immediately after hosting a mission and clicking start mission. Or I need to set back up my VR, but I'm too lazy
lemme do that rq

When trying to upload I get a limit exceeded error. What limit have I exceeded? There is not much on the map
only made one alpha group for like 12 jets
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ

something related to an objective?
OH
i set a blank objective i think

yeah how many objectives do you have?
1
blank

@[SPF]_CAPTPhilipp™ do you have any incomplete objectives with big red text at the top?
yeah i  give up
not on the using the brain part but the time it takes to go back to the editor lmao

big map with lots of city area?
yeah probably bigger than it needs to be for a few planes flying next to each other terribly
City area is a huge hit on load times. You can trim it down and repack the map

I'm just learning the mission editor and I didn't see an option to switch a base from red to blue. Is it possible to switch the alliance of a base in real time?
I was planning to do a capture the base type of mission.
There's an event action to change it

<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ> Just added two new questions: Q: How can I re-roll new alt spawn locations when I respawn units? Q: How do I make a random chance of something happening?
Question, I'm trying to allow for player choice in drop off objectives. So I have multiple drop off objectives targeting the same units. When I go to drop off the units, all the objectives get completed at once, where as I only want the one I actually complete to finish. Is this a bug?
isnt that conditonal?

like

Did u see that in the editor while my mission was loaded ?
How would I go about making "or" conditions. I want to make a strike mission where you have to destroy the targets OR kill all of the enemy aircraft so its kinda like a strike mission and TDM at the same time
do I set all objectives to not required since you can complete the mission without doing all objectives

What triggers a game to end? All required obj are completed?
yep
all required objectives for that team anyway

I seem to be having an issue with StaticObject references in the new 1.5.2. Haven't noticed this issue in previous versions. I am curious if anyone is experiencing the problem as well? When making a StaticObject reference inside the conditional editor my list of StaticObjects is just coming up blank even though I have StaticObjects.
I have tried to restart the game but no good still.
I noticed that only oil platforms are able to be referenced

Im now convinced that the issues I was having yesterday with the "force alt spawn" and wanting the units to respawn at random positions was infact bugged... because I now have the 2 fighters respawning consistantly and randomly, as I want them... in ways that the game doesnt really... account for.  think I should make a bug report? its, if i can truly confirm it, a fairly complex bug.  Posting this here, cos I believe its still a mission editor related thing, until later when I make a bug post.
Ah ok, thanks, good to know
same problem i checked what you told but there was nothing

is there way to transport infantry?
using units and not the AV42C
walking

I have two drop off objectives targeting the same units. When I go to fulfill one, both of them complete together, even though I'm clearly not fulfilling the other. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
sounds like it, but I'd have to see them to be sure
@Sypwn how does the MPA 155 work? because it says it only fires on a position when commanded to but how do you tell it to shoot and tell it where to shoot?

@Sypwn how does the MPA 155 work? because it says it only fires on a position when commanded to but how do you tell it to shoot and tell it where to shoot?
trigger actions
You could probably have ai despawn near a vehicle, have the vehicle drive to the drop off and respawn the infantry

Can the HB-106 attack and kill a carrier?
Not easily
how about 20?

so ive just started making missions, how do I make a unit attack a specific spot?
Im trying to get HB-106's to attack an airbase
add a waypoint

Is it just the bullsharks that can attack a carrier?
seems like dyn lib uses those as carrier cap threats
ASF-30 can as well, if you give them bombs and explicitly order them to attack it.

I've read the advice about making old missions multiplayer compatible except that I'm stuck with the step of "import your mission into that campaign" from which screen am I able to import a mission?
From the campaign editor for a **singleplayer campaign**, there's a button that says "import".
when a unit is respawnable, does it still need to be manually respawned after it was killed?

Yes
Functionality question: Can someone go into detail about the "unit detected" parameter in logic windows? My main thing is figuring out if it is persistent or not. For example: Player is detected by a radar system only for a moment. Later, the radar system is destroyed and no units are detecting the player- if I call a "unit detected" parameter following the radar destruction, will it print as true of false?

Normally a unit's "detected" status persists for the rest of their life. But Baha just added a "gets detected now" condition for players.
so that prints true of false if the player is within view ranges at the time of the conditional firing?

I believe he renamed the old condition to "was ever detected" which is more accurate to the original functionally
Also, number alive doesn't count stuff unspawned right?

Also, number alive doesn't count stuff unspawned right?
it didn't prior to 1.5. not sure if that changed
i.e. if I use it as the win objective (number of enemy forces alive is 0), that should be fine?

i.e. if I use it as the win objective (number of enemy forces alive is 0), that should be fine?
AI units that have never spawned in are considered alive
I see

it's different for player units, though, right?
cuz i made that work once
Best workaround is to use "num near waypoint" with a radius that covers the whole map. That will only count units that are presently alive

What's the best way to get ground units to follow a path in formation?
Put them in a group, other that group to follow the path
how can i  put a oil rig in, i once was able to now i cant

Do the WR-25 Rocket Pods sink carrier?

That's the right attitude to have

Hey, I think I've found a bug related to the mission editor but I'm not sure. let me check if you guys know anything about it first. It's a bit hard to describe but when you have player's MPspawns with lives and some other player spawns without lives, when you have all players switch to the new spawns that had no lives by adding lives to them, then set the lives of the aircraft they started with to zero it prevents players from joining even if there are free slots. it say's the lobby is full, even if you have it set to allow joining in progress. I've got a 6 player mission that has each player moving to 3 other aircraft as the mission progresses removing lives of their previous tier aircraft and adding lives to the next. once all lives get removed from the first aircraft and lives get added to the second aircraft for players to switch to, it seems like that's the point that the game someone stops letting people join the mission in progress. sorry for that being so long winded, not sure how else to describe it. anyone know what might be going on there?
No clue, not having the same issue
@Sypwn

ok so it will just restart itself? destroying the vehicle doesnt even happen?
Yeah I know....
but when the player is not near WPT 20,000m it doesn't destroy the vehicle

basically saying include a global value for the game to reference when deciding to kill a player. so both conditions are met. Is Not Near WPT and global value = 0 it will kill the player?
no, that was just for me to prevent people from taking off before a race
ok so youre saying add a altitude maximum?

ok so youre saying add a altitude maximum?
no lol. Its just an example of what i did
that was to prevent people from skipping parts of the race by forcing them to stay low

do you send it immediately at game start?
yes but I also send it whenever a player dies
so you can always see the BFM arena boundaries

what are you using as the ball?
No ball, had to be a little creative. You have to land a 1000lb dumb bomb on a tiny bunker perched on a spike to score. I took away the TGP because you could cheat with it lol
LOL

so camp by the goal and wait 1 minute?
Yep
LOL

i believe it works for gps bombs set to dumb mode? idk
I only give non gps total dumb dumb bombs in soccer so thats ok

Why would the plane be able to CCPR off of a TGP point, but not off a GPS point?
because it means that dumb bombs are in a Low Tech mode without the TGP\
mission design basically

so i think we agree?
no I have no idea what you are talking about
Arbitarailly less accurate when its a GPS point vs when its a TGP point?

Arbitarailly less accurate when its a GPS point vs when its a TGP point?
a point is a point, the aircraft shouldnt be magically more or less accurate
nonono you misunderstand me

> the bomb just doesnt have a terminal guidance phase arent dumb bombs unguided anyway tho?
yes but we have found out that you cannot CCRP a dumb bomb without a tgp
yes ok?

quick question how do i add allied units to enemy team? for example i want to place an assault carrier on team b but i cant, theres only the nfp one
you cannot do that
fr?

you dropped a TGP assisted CCRP dumb bomb recently?
idk bout recently bur sure
Why would it be any harder than with the TGP?

Why would it be any harder than with the TGP?
Dropping off the TGP and dropping off the GPS should be identical
it wouldn't you would just have more situational awareness with the TGP. Lets say the GPS target isn't sent to you and you have to place it manually thats a lot easier with a tgp compared to trying to mark a gps point in the nav map when the target is force undetected

you are simply saying its harder to get a GPS point than a TGP point?
yeah which is why I said we agree like 10 messages ago LOL add a CCRP mode for dumb bombs via GPS
this is what confused me

Does anyone here have any clue on how to make the AWACS work in the mission editor? I've got it set to take off and circle an orbit point, turn on its radar and have open communications. Am I missing something? he still comes back as if its not on station when requesting a bogey dope, RTB vector, etc.
how do you set rocket arty targets
there's an action to fire at waypoint

is there a way to set it for a squad instead of a single unit?
yes, put all the artillery in a unit group
i did

are there any other types of units in that group?
no
Oh, you're right. It's not there, and never was. My bad.

If I set rearm location to none will npcs rtb?
dunno

an unnamed entity

anybody have any advice on how to make the AWACS work in a multiplayer scenario?
Just curious... before I make a proper bug report, does anyone else have issues where F-26 fighters can only take off once from carriers?   If you made them respawn, once respawed, they cannot take off from the carrier anymore and this is what the player log gives me:  -11752858 ModuleEngine.SetPower(0) -11752858 ModuleEngine.SetPower(1) -11752858 ModuleEngine.ToggleEngine() to False F/A-26B [38] requesting takeoff. F/A-26B [38] no runway for takeoff. -11755596 ModuleEngine.SetPower(0) -11755596 ModuleEngine.SetPower(1) -11755596 ModuleEngine.ToggleEngine() to False F/A-26B [37] requesting takeoff. F/A-26B [37] no runway for takeoff.  Take note, they do take off just fine the first time.
That seems likely to be a bug, when you post it make sure to include a full log file (and a vts file if possible)

so she has to have some escorts to work? I hope that's it. Thank you, I'll let you know how it goes
No you can just slap her down
But she has to arms of her own and needs protection

Have you verified your game files?
I have
Can I get a screenshot of its settings

try removing the engage enmys?
I have events that set it to take off and circle the orbit point. Ok I'll try that
and fly wit it

it climbs to 33,000 feet and starts its orbit. I'm thing my waypoint is the issue. Maybe I set it too high in the air?
thats pretty high what height does the alt warn in the jets start
is it 30k or 40k

i swear its 40k so 30k for an AWACS should be fine(?)
its 40k, i have the default altitude and orbit altitude set to 10k and it just ignores it and climbs
I deleted it and the events and remade them all, going to try it now

Does anyone know how to set the visibility for a map I uploaded to public?
I don’t see the option

According to google, that might be the problem

how do you guys edit your map PNGs? like adding the bullseye and stuff
like... does anyone have a PNG of the bullseye marker?
You can't. The bullseye location is set in the scenario information.

Does anyone have any good  missions for the AH-94?
(Singleplayer)
depends on what you are looking for. i remember some good CAW missions being on the workshop, those are multiplayer though. why singleplayer anyways?

Add it with gimp
Omg, if he does this, it would save me tons of time.

Like, get you the mission file you can edit?? My drive with killbox and BoM crashed so all that work is GONE.
Yeah. @Strikeeaglechase

Is there a way to check if there are no enemies near a waypoint? I thought I might be able to use trigger event (Proximity, AnyEnemy, OnExit). But enemy units being destroyed don't trigger the event.
Use a conditional trigger event, not proximity
UnitList (select all enemies) num near wpt equals 0

Got another question for one of you wizards, I have a conditional trigger event, when tank is not alive, spawn tank. If you kill the tank it spawns again, but only once.  I thought maybe once the trigger condition is met, perhaps its no longer enabled. So I tried setting the trigger event to enable itself after spawning the tank - that didn't work either. Ideas?

damnit, alright thank you

how on earth do i setup ground artillery to fire on a waypoint? do i really have to manually create an event for every single one of them?
also, when making enemy planes take off, can i just set them on orbit when placing them in the hangars and, once i want them to have them take off so they will automatically move to their orbit waypoint without anymore input?  the way i have been doing it is set them to parked, then make them take off and have a second conditional event telling them to orbit once taken off
Yes

Hello there ! Does anyone has already made a scenario with infinite ammo ? I would have thought it'll take few days for variation of missions with infinite ammo to appear in multiplayer but I haven't seen any...
Anyone know if objectives that have been cancelled can be triggered again?    Say I want to start an objective, then cancel, then restart, then cancel.. so on.    Use-case: signaling directives for air superiority pvp missions (defend CAP, retake the CAP)
I think so

restarts just stop the event in its tracks and restart it i believe

why is the AWACS in my mission just responding with unable to everything? it is orbiting a point with radar and comms turned on. do i need to turn engage enemies on?
also my MAD4s dont start deployed anymore? do i use the event "park now"? or is it engage enemies
Is there some easier way to test longer MP missions? I usually set ammo to infinite and slog through until I get to the objective, only to find a bug and have to restart

Engage enemies for radar units is, IIRC, the same as "radar tracking". You need to have both on

Yeah. Or create the mission as a SP mission (so you can use the devcam gun and fast-fowarding), then convert it to MP after the triggers are tested.

Its not possible to convert MP back to SP is it?
Officially, no. But it's pretty straightforward if you already know how to do vts editing.
Alrighty, cool. Is there any good resources for VTS editing anywhere? I assume its like editing text documents and such?

Thankyou again

If ally fighters are set to "parked" and dont automatically take off, how can you make them take off, without setting a trigger?  here's my scenario: I want wingmen to be on standby on the ground. they will only take off if you actively call for your wingmen via "form up" or something like that... but if they are set to "parked" in their unit settings, nothing can get them to take off, unless you made an event or trigger that makes them take off.
you can tell ai wingmen to take off with the comms menu im pretty sure
I thought about the same, but... I dint actually see any take off command there. only refuel, rtb, rtb & refuel

So my soccer mode is nearly perfect, but there is one bug I am trying to fix.  How would I create a delayed respawn? For example a bunker is destroyed by a bomb and I want it to respawn 20 seconds after being destroyed. Currently it instantly respawns after being destroyed. This causes a rare issue where if two attackers drop bombs that are on target it allows their team to score 2 points in one round.
Anyone free to help test something? Look for Shamebird's lobby. PVP Miami map.

Is this about right or am I all wrong? This is a tad confusing to me lol sorry
I changed the exit condition "or" to "and" because both goals should be alive
Yeah, then restart the event sequence after a delay of 20 seconds

The time delay should be in the first or second node?
(Im doing 60 seconds for testing purposes)
2nd node

Any idea why that might be?
Where does the delayed goal respawn event get triggered?
Nvm then

Where does the delayed goal respawn event get triggered?
Nvm then
Its triggered by the completion of each objective

Does each objective complete when a bunker is destroyed?
Yes
the same bunker

Ok and set it to begin immediately?
Yes
But also add a 20 second delay on the first node

So thats all that would be needed?
You also need to delay the start of the next objective otherwise it all starts instantly
Ah gotcha

How would you go about doing that with my existing framework?
It's pretty difficult. I have made a similar mission easier and I just used event sequences for most of it
What if i switched from pre req to triggered and started the next mission with the respawn delay

So I'm having an issue in trying to set up a mission. I can't get allies or enemies to follow paths. Is there a good guide on doing it? I draw the path with points, have the vehicles spawn right next to it, set them to 'path' (and I've tried 'railpath') and they don't move at all.
Wondering if it has to be a 'only one vehicle can use the path' thing, and I need to set the rest to follow...? (Haven't used follow yet tho)
Oh hi Urban

Forced alt spawn index is 1 based right?
It starts at 1, yes
but internally, and in the player log, they start at -1 for...reasons.

Does anyone know the character limit per briefing page?
And per objective page
Nm. Found a rough estimate

Is there a dev log or console I can bring up whilst viewing dev cam? Some way to peek into the guts of a mission to see whats firing off?
I imagine not but I thought I'd ask just in case
https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/mfg6inev/ it's a mod but it's the closest thing we have

Alright, is there any reason, that all my AI and events wont work or fire off? E.g. SAM wont have radar, no AI do what the initial events say.
I've restarted my game, thought it could be that
No objectives, radio response

so my awacs was still not responding after setting it to "engage enemies". it was sharing its data trough data link, however it would not speak to us at all.  i had set him up to just take off. he then defaulted to orbiting his default waypoint. maybe he was still in "take off" behavior and would not respond? i set up an event now to properly change his behavior to orbit his waypoint after takeoff now, will test later if that fixes it
Alright, I'm working on an air-to-air mission. I want the enemy planes to spawn in after the player(s) get within a certain distance of a waypoint. Figured out how to make the trigger event, but how do I make it so the enemy planes don't spawn in *until* the player crosses that point?
Do I just uncheck 'spawn immediately' on all the units?

What units are members of EnemyEcho?
The log shows this is actually a problem with a unitgroup
yeah, but its for the ai wing leader code

hey fellas, I see that 'Alt Spawns' are designed for AI units, but has anyone figured out a way to make them work for player aircraft? I'm looking to utilize the ability to change loadouts from the altspawn feature for players, so a movespawn won't do in this situation as I can't adjust loadouts directly with those. Does anyone know if there's a clever way to accomplish this via vts editing or some other method, or am I out of luck using altspawns to set various loadouts throughout my mission in vtol's current state?
You have to use different player spawns
Each player spawn is associated one loadout, whether forced or not

Does it need to be a DM? Can we just make a thread?
sure, that will work.
Looking at the IComparer.Compare() bug, its kinda weird this hasn't broken the game completely

Something to do with enemy seagroup Mike I think?
In reference to everything else
Nvm i think this is it

Can I turn a path in the editor into a path in the GPS so it shows up on the NAV page? I have a small mission where the player can shoot some targets and go for a canyon run.
I think you have to use waypoints
I think that paths are only for AI

If I check for units like this, is there a way to check their height aswell?
I think you have to do it individually
Or use an objective fly to instead

Is there a way to respawn destroyed units? I got an event set to "Spawn All" but that only spawned units, that were not spawned before.
Spawn all respawns them if they are destroyed also
Can I check somewhere if that trigger actually triggered?

in the player.log
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

I would assume an event can be triggered multiple times, correct?
if i sart a timed event does it continue to go untill i tel it to stop?
yes

if i sart a timed event does it continue to go untill i tel it to stop?
yes
oof

does what i dicsribed work?
not at all
oof

set a time delay for the event and then just tigger it after evry objective complete?
does this work @Sypwn?
wait no

Did you start the sequence or check "start immediately"? Did you check the "respawnable" box in the unit's properties?
one sec
slight goof

How would one go about creating a objective matrix that can have any group of 22 Groups of 4 infantry land at any 22 bases, without having to drop all 22 groups at one base, and without all 22 objectives completing at once due to a minimum of 4 infantry being dropped off at a single objective waypoint?  (I've already created an entire framework of events that react to any base being taken by any group, and leveling from short to long range, who owns it, etc.. This is just the last piece, and I can't think through it currently)  Fixed it: I eneded up using a event sequence of 2 minutes, that cancled the objective, reset it, then begain it, that was only fired by a conditinal event that had a condition of: All unit groups: IS NOT: Near waypoint (waypoint) distance.  then ran into a bug where if you set a rally point, and the infantry park at the rally, they couldnt be set a path or interacted with at all, so ended up moving the rally point to a diffrent than the drop off location waypoint to make everything work.
I think ISEGaming has experience with multiple dropoff points for infantry, but I don't want to ping them at 2AM EST.
I don't know enough about pickup/dropoff mechanics to offer a recommendation.

so setting the AWACS to orbit also didnt help. quick recap on my problem: the AWACS in my mission will only respond with "negative" or the likes. he does however share his data via data link. he is set to engage enemies, comms enabled and also orbit a waypoint.  going back to my older missions, the AWACS there also doesnt work anymore. is this an issue with a update?
I've had the same exact issue for over a week and yesterday I hopped into the premade F-45 mission and the AWACS did the same thing so I'd say it's a bug introduced with the update

Is it intended that if you put multiple ground units into a group they stop following their given path?
Hei guys 🙂 i made a little mission and wanted to test it. It has 7 basic objectives with lots of targets during a night time operation. It is nothing special but up to 15 people can fly together. Any tips on how to test it properly?
Fly it solo (if possible) before getting other people involved. It's quite frustrating to get a group together only for the mission to completely break 5 mins in.

You can't bulk kill units with a group?  like for example:  Allied: Group Bravo               Action: Kill all *Wouldn't* actually kill them?

I have a bomber set to fly along a path and deploy 8 ASMs, but in game it opens the doors, deploys one ASM, keeps flying the path with its doors open, turns around when it hits the end of the path and circles around before deploying another. How do I make it shoot off a volley?

I tried removing the path and allowing it to freely orbit a point within deployment range. It now deploys one missile and orbits with its doors open until either given another order or shot down. I have also tried spacing out the deployments with five second sequence delays.  No luck.
i dont think its possible

You use the same action to set invincible and remove invincible
The check box tells it which one you're doing

Question, is it possible to edit a workshop multiplayer mission in the mission editor?
Only if you are the creator
Ok, good.

what does "force detected" do in the editor?
Makes that unit show up on NAV to the enemy, regardless of if they've actually been seen or not.
Note it does NOT show up on the F-45 HUD/TSD because of a technicality. But it does show up on all units NAV page.

if i do that, woould it be viable to use the nav screen to use gps guided munitions?
im trying to make it so if you do recon in the previous mission, you do an easier version of the mission in which you have the targets gps locations
The player can indeed use it to manually create a GPS point based on location of the unit on NAV. But if that's your intent, you might as well also send them the GPS data directly.

hey. is there a way i can force an eject to a player and then end the mission successfully??
In SP? Not that I can think of
wanted to have a mission end with you ejecting and the next mission is to protect a group of heli to rescue said pilot

do i need to do this for each target?

do i need to do this for each target?
yeah
ah

and then make a dif event for each?
Not an entire event, just another action
ah

how do i make it send, do i need to do somthing to make it send at spawn?
Only players that are alive and in their cockpit at the time will receive the GPS coords. So you have to work around that
at what time though?

can i make diffrent gps groups send?
like one for radars, one for iraps, one for bunkers?
People wonder why all the custom missions are so similar with cookie cutter objectives. Then they try to use the mission editor and discover all the limitations.

yeah

sypwn, two questions.  if i complete a mission then eject it will still pass right?
two how to force eject or to force win a mission
I think that's the number you specify in the action properties

but if you win a mission you can still eject without loosing ???
Once the mission ends, its outcome cannot be changed
👍

is it me or does the f-45 have way superior AI and parameters than literally all the enemy units?  2x f-45 vs 2x asf-33 and the ASF units get absolutely descimated, sometimes without a single f-45 loss. this is repeatable... quite a lot.  2x f-45 vs 2x asf-58, same deal, if anything, the asf-58 planes fare even worse.  for a multiplayer game where both teams have some AI units flying around, as im trying to make, this makes it extremely unfair for one team, giving a large disadvantage to one team, and a big advantage to the other. it makes it so the mission I wanna make is kinda impossible to make
I'll see if I can confirm this tomorrow, i've been struggling with this for over an hour. I hope its just me being tired, but if this really is the case, I guess I simply cannot make the mission then
asmrm-7s are pretty dogshit, especially compared to 120ds

wonder if the asf-30 would be a more fair balance?
prob asf-30 or maaybe 33 yeah
I figured the lower thrust of the other two would give it a disadvantage

i mean you could just give team b more numbers, no?
I could, but there is a score counter that keeps track of team kills. first team to x kills win.  I mean, I probably could change the goals a bit
The AH-94 Proficiency Test mission has an objective to escort a tank under fire. It's actually invincible except when it gets really close to an enemy the player hasn't killed.

well having ai v ai count for that might not be the best anyway? idk
could probably set up a way for team b ai deaths to count as less tho..
true. but that does still mean one team will have more enemy AI targets shooting at them

Im trying to test a mission scenario im creating and when I go to load into the map from the loadout/briefing room it my view goes black and it freezes. I assume it is crashing or stuck loading infinitely. Any idea how to fix it?

aaah sweet. Thanks! ill try that

Oh boy, what exactly happens when I repair it? Obviously updating it to the latest build and such, my last update was just before 1.5.5
It corrects the mission and campaign metadata.
Before anyone asks, I do have it backed up online and as a ZIP, so I am fine if it royally borks it. But I did find some new trigger bugs I gotta fix

is there a way to make a group of ships follow a single path in a formation? Or do you have to make a parallel path for every ship unit to follow individually?
if you put them in a group, and order the UnitGroup to follow the path, they will use a Vee formation.
oh cool thanks!

Can the trigger events be re-enabled once they fire off to be used as a loop? Or do i need to make use of the sequence?
Okay, nevermind, but another question arose. When using event sequences, do all of the nodes check their entry condition, or only the nodes before which another nodes have fired off? To put in another terms: Do nodes need to fire before another node for it to fire?
is it like if then if then if then...  or more like if {} if {} if {} if {} .... ?

They will enable a single time per conditions met So  if: unit: alive Then: kill  If unit: is not: alive  Then: spawn  Would lead to an infinite loop

how could I make a singleplayer mission for a modded aircraft such as mirage 2k or gav-25?
Theoretically you open the mission editor with that mod active, and the vehicle should show up as an option
or would that break on the workshop

okay but I could send the raw files for the modded mission to another player and it could work?
yeah

no

i plan to make use of this new respawnable setting just gonna figure out how it works does it work through an event/trigger? or when i tick it on lets say a bomber if he dies does spawn back in a set time
and lets say if we captured an airbase where he respawns id have to trigger an event to stop it

Im trying to make a engage enemies toggle event. as of right now I'm using the fuel port as the toggle switch. its supposed to set a unit group to attack the player when open and toggle them off when its closed. as well as tell teh player they have been toggled to passive or hostile with a tutorial message. but when i toggle the fuel port switch it doesn't do anything?
any tips?
Cockpit controls don't work in multiplayer

What are you trying to accomplish tho?
damn
i wanted to make a lobby for me and friends to practice shooting at AI jets that are default not aggressive but then have the ability to toggle them to become aggressive at any time with a switch in the plane

@Strikeeaglechase @THE GREAT OVERLORD OF ALL CHEESE do you know if radars or launchers have minimum engagement ranges? And if so, what they are? I have a SLAM truck linked to a SAM S/A Radar and it only seems to lock+fire within a very narrow range window.
Yes some have min-range, ill check what its set to for the slam truck
1km

is there something else I can try so balance a red vs blue team mission where one team's AI (the blue team) just doesn have MASSIVELY better specs and destroys the other team? balancing is pretty much impossible when the AI f-26 takes 2 missile hits to destroy and every red AI plane takes only one, and gets out maneuvered (asf-30 vs f 26 has a 1;6 kill ratio in the f26's favor.)
not beyond what I've already suggested
only somewhat balanced fight is f45 vs asf33, and the f46 is, arguably, not even a fighter

what channel does he watch? never really saw a suggestion channel. cos having AI planes of the same types on both teams would solve the multiplayer issue instantly (both sides can have asf planes for Ai and both can have F series planes as AI)
oh thats damn true, lol

Is there some way to add a benefit for ejecting before you get killed/the pilot surviving?
nope
Hey another question, Is there a way to choose your spawn point between a few areas WITHOUT adding additional planes/ players?   (IE: I want to have One type of each aircraft that the player picks and then give them a choice where that plane spawns in.)

You can use multiple slots to represent each spawn location, and with fancy trigger work make them mutually exclusive so you don't raise the player cap. ```Alpha 1-1 - Spawns on Airbase A Alpha 1-2 - Spawns on Airbase B Alpha 1-3 - Spawns on Airbase C Bravo 1-1 - Spawns on Airbase A Bravo 1-2 - Spawns on Airbase B Bravo 1-3 - Spawns on Airbase C``` As soon as Alpha 1-1 spawns in, Alpha 1-2 and 1-3 are locked out. As soon as Bravo 1-2 spawns in, Bravo 1-1 and 1-3 are locked out. etc

What are the units in the vehicle speeds? I.E is fast 30 30 kts, 30 kmh?
m/s i believe
Editor units are all in metric

Are units in a group?
not sure
the gunboats are for sure cause there's 3

and the completed event is when the obj is done correct?
yes
how far is this radius 10? does it mean 10k?

Quick question: How many of you guys and girls use the "Health percentage" slider in mission editor, as a condition?  Like for example, make it so if an enemy is at 50 percent health, they get destroyed?  Its... a cool setting that kinda helped me a lot right now with my "f26 are flying tanks" issue.  To those with issues, Give that conditional a try... That is, if its underused...

So I made a basic 1v1 MP mission for a friend and I to practice missile avoidance. How do I set it up to where we can play together? Do I upload to workshop and add it like a regular workshop mission?
if it's a MP campaign then yep just upload it and run it like any mission

awesome, it is, thank you!

Hey y'all I just have a quick question.   Is it possible for vehicles during the initial spawn to be in cold spawn mode, but in subsequent respawns, have them in flight ready mode? Or is it just one or the other for the whole mission?
If its on a moving carrier, no. Otherwise, yeah just "move" the spawn to the same location but change it to hot start. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#movespawn>
alright cool thank you! I'll check that out now

does anyone here have experience with AI using Aim-9e missiles? im not sure if im doing something wrong, but f-26 AI simply refuses to use those missiles. and they barely use guns too, even if placed right behind a non-engaging red aircraft. they just kinda dance around wildly and never aim, then disengage, take a WIDE circle and do the same thing.  asf-30's however, they use their rear aspect missiles and guns PLENTY.  possible bug, or am i missing something in the editor?  if its a bug, i'll make a report tomorrow when my power is back on.
Yeah that sounds like a bug
I rarely touch Team A AI units

The bigger question is, how did you miss the pinned FAQ link?
you're right.
@Sypwn moderator colour change??

That renders mission base names useless, right? I was going to use it to change the name with ownership change in a campaign. It's not a huge deal. I'll just pick a name and stick with it.
how do i select multiple units at a time to copy them
you can't

Out of curiosity, why are you trying to copy a group of units?
The only time I would have found that particularly useful was before unit respawning was added.  Otherwise single unit copying covers most of what I need.
*Triggers, however...*

triggers and events can't be copied right?
Only by doing it manually in the vts file.
i’m making an old tech a2a battle cuz i can’t find any and have never made a mission so i thought it would be fun, but i want to copy a squadron and place them in a different location

Are the different members of the squadron different types of aircraft?
If not, copy one unit to the new location, change its group, then copy that unit to fill the rest of the squad
i’ll add more aircraft and different aircraft as you progress

this was supposed to work, right? but it keeps adding funds every 5 seconds even if the unit is alive, after the first entry.. c'mon i can't be that dumb can i?
if i put a friendly aircraft in my aircraft group (alpha, etc..) with they fly with me and follow my commands?
Only in singleplayer missions

if i put a friendly aircraft in my aircraft group (alpha, etc..) with they fly with me and follow my commands?
Only in singleplayer missions
doesnt necessarily needs to be in the same group. you choose "force player commands" in the unit

Which condition is that you're showing? I see two entry conditions
first one
what's the second one?

You said the trigger fires continually even if ASF-33 [19] was never killed?
after the first kill, it continues to fire repeatedly even after the unit respawn
Now I'm trying to remember how Alive checks work for respawning AI units...

is initial delay in seconds or minutes?
seconds
great thanks

Is it a SP standalone mission, SP campaign, or MP campaign?
hey how do you make someting spawn the same time as you
like you die right

an AI will spawn with you, how do you do that?
If you need to do it once, a conditional event
If you need to do it multiple times, a looping event sequence

can you post a screenshot of what you have now?
yeah just wait a sec
and the event sequence?

But what's this attached to? A conditional event?
i was ussing trigger events not sequence
ah

So the problem is you want the AI to spawn in when you spawn in (after 5 deaths), but instead it's spawning it when you die (after 5 deaths)?
yes
exactly

do I just put nothing in node 1?
Just an exit condition, nothing else
This FAQ answer may also be a helpful read: <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#sequenceorder>

did you disable or delete the old conditional trigger?
not when I spawned
yeahh

should I put start inmediatly?
yeah
didnt work

can you drop your player log?
how do I do that?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

If you start your MP3 player while mission BGM is playing, your MP3 player will override and stop the custom BGM (instead of playing both at the same time). If you then pause the MP3 player, it won't resume the BGM, so the result is nothing is playing anymore.

Are they in a group?
I tried. Can you share how.
Check the "respawnable" box and then trigger the spawn action after they die

How do i tell the group to follow the path?
All i want them to do is keep moving.
There's an event action UnitGroup -> Name of group -> Follow path (or something like that)

Are there any plans to make the mission and map editors compatible with 4K displays? Right now the UI is scaled for 1080p resolution, and everything is almost frustratingly small to click on.
Not that I'm aware
Okay then, no worries.

Is it possible to display a message to only one player or selected players? It seems that you can either displayy a message for everyone on a team or to everyone in the game (on both teams)
Nope
Damn it!

But it shows that to everyone or everyone on the team right?
Shows to everyone
I will explain what I have made and maybe one of you brilliant minds can help me with the last puzzle piece: I have essentially create an Among Us game mode. There are 4 players, each game one of them is chosen at random to be the "alien". If the alien dies or If all 3 humans die the game ends. This is all working properly. However, I do not currently have a way to let the alien know that they are the alien while not telling the humans who the alien is.

they spawn in differente locations?
do they see each other on spawn?
They will show up on NAV. No way to prevent that

do they see each other on spawn?
They will show up on NAV. No way to prevent that
i don't know if it's the smartest solution, but the first thing that ocurred to me is use a 'flare' in front of the players blue for humans red for alien for example for 5 seconds

may i ask how u did it?
oh yeah, chances. ok
Yes using chances but I also had to make it to where there is a max limit of imposters and there is always that amount

in the objective editor if you set it to "final" for start does it not appear until all other objectives are complete?

Hi! I'm trying to figure out how to make your wingman land at whatever airbase the player is at, and then take off when the player doea something like start their engines. I've tried using a conditional event and a waypoint event to land the wingman. The problem is that the wingman won't take off again even if the takeoff event is triggered

How many points can a path handle, what would be recommended?
I have paths with hundreds of points
okay great

Is it possible for different vehicles to have different RTB way points at the same time?
afaik you can't, but you should be able to change the waypoint with triggers
Okay, thanks

Also, I have enemy planes on a carrier, and have the 'engage enemies' box checked, but when I engage the strike group, the planes don't launch to engage in the battle. Is there a way to make them engage?
Order them to take off with trigger actions
you can make it conditional on the player getting close

How could I do that?
You're lucky I have the editor open already (forgot to increase the radius to something reasonable)
But you should really try to figure things out yourself first

quick question regarding BGM: There is a "play bgm" event that I can use to play music, but how can I cycle between songs, instead of just looping the same song over and over?  wondering if im missing something
Does playing a different BGM not stop the previous one?
My guess is you just tell it to play a different BGM, but I haven't tried it myself.

<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ> Added: Q: How do I make a ground unit follow the road? Q: Can I despawn or teleport AI units?
Wow, after struggling for a bit I finally figured out everything needed to make it so you can have troops pre-spawned and perform a load/unload sequence.  Here's what you need along with the entry conditions needed for it to transition correctly. Without the first entry conditional, (is not landed), the aircraft will orbit its takeoff location. If the second conditional is excluded, the troops will not unload from the craft.
already figured it out but thanks

Does anyone know how to make a wingman land and take off with the player?
Can you RE-trigger a timed event? Or is it just objectives that can now be reset? Thanks.

Is there a way to track if someone has ejected in the mission editor? Having "ejected" as a trigger condition?  I'm working on mission with CSAR aspects, so that if you're shot down you have to go pick up your pilot before you can get back into the action. I'd like to be able to track if someone successfully ejected or not and give them different pickup objectives accordingly.
nope

Like how? Every time I use the land command, I can't get the wingman to take back off

Like how? Every time I use the land command, I can't get the wingman to take back off
Oh, not sure why they wouldn't take off when ordered to
I've tried using both conditional and proximity events. It seems that once a wingman has landed and powered down, they won't power back on

its not ideal but you could spawn in new ones?
ideally this should work tho
they should be able to take off again

@Sypwn even if I use the "player is not landed" condition?
I guess what I'm asking here is what defines the "landed" condition?
Wheels touching the ground

I want to leave aircraft as props. I set their default behavior to parked and unchecked "engage enemies." Is that good?
Was late last night and didn't get to test it. I'm at work rn
Yeah. Just be aware that enemy units will still attack those "props" if they get the opportunity

Like, using attack target actions to force blue on blue? I planned to test that later.
yep, but it wont work if the aircraft has missile equiped, it will attempt to attack the target with missiles, but either the radar, the missile, or some part of the missile attack routine has a friendly fire check, so it will never launch
bummer

Is there any reason my tanks aren't moving?

Question guys. Is BGM in missions limited in volume? I really want to have loud bgm, but even at 100% volume in settings, it's really quiet, even if I amplify the absolute ass out of it in audacity.
The same goes for "sound effects," I can't find a viable way to make it sound like anything is loud enough to give it an actual meaningful affect in-game. If anybody has any tips lmk
You can't rely on BGM for anything serious to the mission. Many players have it turned off in the game options, either for preference, or so they can safely stream the game.

Quick question regarding the radar of the f-26 vs the asf-30...  the map im making is a 200x200km map, however the f-26 planes detect and engage planes that are more than 3/4rds of the map away. thats 3 times more than the asf-30 planes can even dream of detecting planes from... so its really impossible for me to isolate squadrons to certain parts of the map without events.  is that a bug?   cos right now, I need to figure out a way to force every single plane undetected for the f-26 AI, as well as make them get destroyed, ontop of the event that destroys them at 50 percent ehalth, cos they tank missiles, lol....  if this is a bug and not just me missing something, ill make a bug report tomorrow.
I should probably add: I flew in a f-26 in formation with the AI f-26... and they outranged my own radar by a looooot as well
the ASF-30s radar is about 20% worse than the 26b's (inverse square law prob means its *range* is less than 20% different, but thats output power), the AI 26b has an identical radar to the player radar

Are you sure they are getting targets on radar and aren't just turning to them via RWR?
we were waaayyyy out of RWR range as well (I got no RWR until we got way closer, like half the distance?).   when I flew on the red team with the asf-30's,, we (eventually) got within RWR range, but the asf-30's had zero response and even turned away from the very quickly approaching f-26's
so yeah, im... gonna play around tomorrow a bit and see just... what's going on. I could honestly just be making a mistake

Yeah just looking at their stats I don't see why they would behave differently

Question regarding non target lists.  If I add non-targets to a fighter group... does that persist through their death? meaning if I respawn the group - does that list persist or do I need to re-action that?
I think it does for a group. Not sure about individual units though
But you should test it

In a sequence - Does the delay happen before the entry condition.  Does the delay happen before the action? When one node finishes... does it immediately do the delay on the next node? or fire the node then delay? I'm just confused on where the delay takes place.

No, not without mods. You could always use SAMs but they arent the same

I'm building a mission and like to add a tunnel like in the first map, but I see no options in the map editor to do this . Is this possible?
it is not, the game uses height maps to generate it's terrain which don't allow holes to get poked into them
the original map "akutan" was made without the use of heightmaps

In one of the recent updates, the developer, stated that you can use loops in the sequence editor, has anyone figure how to do this?
Ive kinda confirmed its a bug. the moment I put a certain event in for the enemy group, the f 26 will spot the asf 30 at 129km out.  the moment I remove the event, the f-26 will detect normally.  the event in question is to just add "orbit point" and set it to "none" and leave the altitude and radius values as is. that, somehow, forces the asf-30 to be detected.  I took a video and I'll make a proper bug report in a few minutes.  Edit: now im just confused, as I test it more. cos it seems it isnt the orbit event, but rather the fact that the asf turned really hard that made the f 26 see it. but even so, that makes little sense cos there are zero RWR spikes....
Ok, yeah. it isnt a bug with radars or detection ranges or anything likt that. its literally just that the f-26 detects you way before you recieve an RWR warning, if you make hard turns.  asf-30 doesnt detect you at all, but the moment you have an rwr warning and you turn really hard/show your rear end, he detects you.  so yeah... F-26 radar range extends past its rwr range...? which doesnt quite make sense, but that does actually explain things

Is it possible to spawn in a player AV-42 with soldiers already inside?

Is it possible to spawn in a player AV-42 with soldiers already inside?
I think so?
Should be an option at the top of the AV42's properties window

is it possible to edit that in via the VTS file?
I wouldn't try it. If it's disabled in MP, that's probably for a reason.
I think I remember discussing this before, and Chase confirmed it wasn't synced or something.

put the infantry there to be picked up?
or put them wherever the player spawns
I think I'll just have the AV-42 spawn at the platform

where did you want it to spawn before?
it's possible to edit the VTS to spawn infantry on the deck of a carrier
Oh?

How would you go about spawning infantry on the deck of a carrier?
create waypoints where you want the infantry, then copy those waypoint positions into the infantry's positions
After you attach the AV-42 to the carrier deck, you can use that position as a reference point

does if matter if the carrier is moving?
you have to do it before the carrier starts moving
ok and to get the infantry to get into the player AV-42 it's just the same as as if they were on the ground?

ok and to get the infantry to get into the player AV-42 it's just the same as as if they were on the ground?

You'd have to have a separate slot that starts with 0 lives, and add lives later to unlock the slot and the weapons it can access.
You can then lock out the old slots forcing the players to pick the new one at next respawn.

To save me a lot of trial and  error does anyone know what would be a minimum safe distance to stand a carrier group off a coastline that is protected by mad4 launchers and mobile radar please. I don't know about various Sam types etc - is 20k the maximum detection range? Want to launch a flight to clear the ews/mad4 guarding the coastline before cruisers approach. Thanks.
50km+
Closer to 100km would be safer

If I do not select an airport to land at for the Gav-25, will it land at the location it took off from? or will it just disregard the land command?
If it has auto RTB enabled, it will land at the closest allied rearm/airbase when it gets low.
so the rearm stations it will vertically land to?

so the rearm stations it will vertically land to?
wait, do you mean the "land at" action?
just the land command

does the land command have a property to specify a location?

under it, says which airfield. and i have it selected to none.
oh, not sure what would happen

is there a reason for this?
something I have done wrong in the editor?
the map is pretty big

after the crash happens, upload your player.log

you want the whole thing?
the whole log, yes
have fun

Are you sure this is the whole thing? It doesn't show any crashes. And why is it called "message.txt"?
probably becausse of how many characters it is, discord will automatically do it sometimes, could also be its off notepad. and the crashed happened 2 minutes before this
Anyway, can you open the ATC Free Flight objective properties and take a screenshot of it?

Anyway, can you open the ATC Free Flight objective properties and take a screenshot of it?
how would I
do that exactly

so you just want me to click on the objective tab in the editor?
yes, then open that objective's properties, then take a screenshot and paste it here
that could be the problem, I was messing around with it just so I could upload it to steam workshop

so should I test it?
yeah
ill send the log if it crashes

Same thing. Did you save changes and test from the mission editor?
yup
ill try again to see

Hello, so I have a mission fully created but I want to be able to host it in a private server, I can’t find it when I try to do it though, how do I upload it? It’s one mission within one campaign.
Did you upload the mission to the workshop?
There is a button to upload it in the campaign editor

Did you upload the mission to the workshop?
There is a button to upload it in the campaign editor
Pretty sure I did.

Should I upload the entire campaign though?
I only uploaded that one mission.
yes, you have to if it's a MP mission

Is there a limit to displayed slots?
~~Unless you do a chase and rewrite the game code from scratch to handle more players~~
not sure, but browning has a mission with something like 30+ slots

When sending path to GPS, I am unsure what "target group" should be? I presume 1 for group A?
It is the name of the GPS group
The one in the GPS menu on the mfd

I got in on takeoff and orbit, but why isnt it putting the boom down?
do you have the fuel port open?
yes sir

do you have the fuel port open?
yes sir
is it a tanker?

so it doesn't have the big spinny dish up top?
no
good, is your internal tank full  it won't let you refuel if you're near full

Is it because they were in orbit yet?
Maybe they weren’t done pathing to orbit so it wouldn’t open
So I tried using system > sendwpt to gps as well as send path to gps neither of which show up in my GPS when I start the game. Does this maybe only work for single player?

<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#conditionalatstart>
the word "gps" dosen't show up there

When I reset objectives, then set another objective to "begin objective" the auto-set waypoint dosen't take effect. I'm assuming to make it like it was never started to begin with I would need to "cancel objective" first?
Other way around, reset, then cancle objective, then have something "begin" it does the trick
Did this end up working out?

Did this end up working out?
Yup it worked just fine from my testing
Just know that if you have multiple av42s it can be tricky to make sure that the specific infantry you want goes into the right plane. As there isn’t much room on the flight deck

Can you trigger an event of an objective being complete? I dont see it as a condition in the logic
Put the action inside the objective's completed event
Oh I see I was thinking backwards putting the objective in the event, ty

Just want to verify there is no way to change the budget in a multiplayer mission during the mission? I wanted to have a budget reward per kill/objective, but from what I am reading that does not work?

Question: how much health does the different planes have?  every single other plane dies when taking a direct missile hit (as you'd expect) except the f/a-26... if thats a bug, I have taken a recording of it and will make a report, but I wanna make sure if its intended before I actually do that.
> every single other plane dies when taking a direct missile hit (as you'd expect) except the f/a-26 Iv seen the F-45 tank missiles many more times than iv seen 26b's, unless you mean AI?
^ I've seen the F-45 tank multiple heaters 😄

for AI iv exported their relevent stats here https://canary.discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/1029607562598948965

In these stats, the f/a-26b has its "wingrightpart" health at 50, but its "wingleftpart" is at 1... why is that? just curious.  also, sorry if this discussion might need to go to the dev channel        "health": 50,       "minDamage": 0,       "name": "wingRightPart"
 and        "health": 1,       "minDamage": 0,       "name": "wingLeftPart"
> why is that Dunno maybe baha meant to update all of em but got sidetracked
I don't think its meant to be like that lol

ah, lol, fair, fair.  huh... Yeah, I guess im gonna have to use a workaround? but then again, the asf-30 has 40 health, same as the f26, according to the .json's
wait what, did the f45 ai get nerfed?
how much health does the av-42 ai have rn

@AtrociousAmbition/Mr. Charisma  clearly it's a cost reduction in the navy contract by right wing weapon manufacturing lobbies. 😩

I've created about 10+ missions and having a blast. However I'm not trying to get enemies to spawn with a trigger. I set the enemy units on the spawn immediately not checked and then use a trigger to spawn unit.  It doesn't seem to be working. Amy I missing something? Is it just those two things? not spawn immediately and then use a trigger to spawn it?
You've got it. Can you send a screenshot of the trigger you're using.
Trigger and action to spawn

Question: what triggers "auto rearm" in AI units?  Specifically, how low on ammunition does a unit need to get before they go rearm? because I have to add a few bombs to some AI units to bring their weight up, but those bombs will never get used. im afraid that since the plane will always have those bombs on it, that Auto rearm will not trigger
Also, during rearm, do ai units also refuel external fuel tanks, and re-equip them if jetissoned?  seems like an odd question, but heres my reasoning: Players have to manually re-equip stuff they jetissoned. if jetissoned, thyey are no longer "part of your loadout" due to the whole pylon being yeeted.  as for refueling external fuel tanks... if it is still on the plane and not "fired" like a regular missile (no empty, yet present, pylon) then does the AI actually have the knowledge to realize "hey-ho, the internal fuel is now refueled, now its the external tanks' turn!"
Currently there is a bug within the mission editor in which certain triggered events only show for the Host, while timed events show up for everyone in the server. I am using this bug to my advantage to be able to send messages to the host only during missions, but i fear that when the bug is fixed i will lose this mechanic.

Recommended weapon loadouts not saving in mp mission. Is this a known issue? Set up 4 FA26 with cruise missiles and and a 65' on pylon 1 and 10 - but it won't save the agm 65s only the cruise missiles. Tried padlocks open and closed and various combos.? Any one else had this. Thanks
"Won't save" meaning if you save, exit the editor, and open it back up, those slots show no overrides?
for some reason it skipped over the first node enitrely and immediatly played the second node, can i have a little help?

Hmm, I don't think the AI can VIFF, but I also don't think you can force it to stall. My guess is it will ignore orders to fly too slow.

Best to test and find out.

Tried it on new missions/maps same issue - then (should have done this before...) checked game files integrity - 82 files with issues re-acquired. When 100% OK made a new vanilla map - v small island - one base - only way I could get the loadout on any aircraft type I placed as a mp spawn to show in briefing room was to lock the padlock on that slot. Any open slots with stuff I wanted to just recommend still didn't show in the briefing. I made sure all weapons were 'available' and  tried on a carrier (where I found the issue) and on land air bases - nothing sorted it. Got the green recommended loadout modal far left of loadout screen but nothing showing unless I padlocked it in the editor. I'm on stable branch. Appreciate you checking you don't have the same issue - not sure what to do next - other than just leave it. Does anyone else reading this have, or has had the same issue?
> Any open slots with stuff I wanted to just recommend still didn't show in the briefing You clicked "load recommended" and nothing happened?  Can you send me the .vts file?
@Hrallil when adding units, there is an option at the top to switch between Allied and Enemy units

I.. dont see any

oo... is there another editor for units ?
After you've created and saved the map, you then need to create a mission and select that map
ooooooo isee

Is there a way to make it so the allied ground units can’t kill enemy ground units but can still attack each other?
yeah just make them all invunerable
wont work if you need aircraft to take them out tho

It shows a lot of other things too. It's pinned for reference.
so this sequence is triggered by a completed objective, which also stops another sequence currently playing music. the stop music thing works properly but it instantly skips goes to peacekeeper loop and skips over peacekeeper initial. I've tried adding a delay to peacekeeper loop but it just plays peace keeper intial then instantly skips over it the momment the delay is over

I made a loop = true path type bezier for a formation of carriers, but everyone stops after a while.  How can I troubleshoot this?
So they follow the path for a while, then stop?
yes, I think it might be back at the start of the loop

yes, I think it might be back at the start of the loop
Are you ordering them to follow it as a group using a trigger? Or are you using default behaviors?

Are you ordering them to follow it as a group using a trigger? Or are you using default behaviors?
they are assigned to a group and appear to hold formation
their chosen formation, I put them in one order and the ships shuffle around as they gain speed

does mp vs single player make a difference?  How about sub-orbital mp spawn heights?
*sub-orbital?*
yeah, asking for a friend.  He wants to know if 100,000 - 200,000m spawn heights will break the path loop

Can you create a single player campaign then convert to multiplayer?
yes, requires some trickey after, sypwn knows how
Good to know, thanks

In what situation is this used, just wondering?
In case someone wants to act as an actual ATC (as a ground or tower controller)
Mainly developed due to a request from someone in a group I'm in, but decided to post it here in case anyone wants to use/modify them since no charts currently exist.

It doesn't seem relevant enough to pin here, but should be put somewhere that can be referenced. @Freedomplaza could this go in one of your manuals?
Or maybe on the wiki @AtrociousAmbition/Mr. Charisma ?
Maybe, if not I'll put it in the SOPs

How do i edit the max Player count in a scenario. It says i can only have 8 players but i want 12. is there any way to change it at all?

How do i edit the max Player count in a scenario. It says i can only have 8 players but i want 12. is there any way to change it at all?
Max players per team is limited by the number of player spawns on that team. Additionally, the max players total (both teams combined) is 16.
If you placed AH-94 spawns, they default to single seat. You have to change Slots to 2 for each one to allow a gunner.

that makes sense as to why i can only have 8 players per team.  can you change the total max of 16?
I will definitely steal the runway measurements tyvm 😊
I dunno what kind of awful diagrams you have seen with no runway length indicators

Are those the actual measurements?
Of course
I did ATC for far too long

Did you get the runway width too by any chance?
70 from memory

If you're trying to make it obvious that we won't get anywhere with text chat, you succeeded.

it could also have something to do with the nested sequences I had going on, too? 🤷‍♂️
Doubt it.
Yeah, probably triggered by copying a unit in a group, but the bug only occurs in specific unknown circumstances.

what is the best way to create a variable ticket system for lives? im trying to make a VTOL rushish gammode where each point taken adds more tickets to the attacking team. They only way i can think to do it is very brute force
I was hoping there would be some way to do it with global values, but then I need to run an "alive" or spawn check for each of the attackers to increment the counter. IK you can use score to keep track of deaths of the team, but the problem with this is that it makes the ticket integration a bit more clunky, especially if i want to add optional objectives that increase the ticket counter. Plus it makes it more difficult to tweak the values as I will have to dig into all of the conditionals for each stage.

Why not simply "Add Lives" to each slot on that team?

Why not simply "Add Lives" to each slot on that team?
I want to keep it a team wide pool, rather than just each slot.
Every time a player's life reaches 0, if there are any spare lives, it grants that player one additional life.

non multiplayer mission how to do aircraft type?
how do i choose if its heli  or not

hmm where is it in mission options?

where dat lol

Question:  Can a mission run indefinitely if at the last objective, you just reset all other objectives?  It's a little more complicated than that, I'm just trying to figure out a way to run something that's similar to a headless server, just not quite headless.
Yes you can reset objectives to make a mission run forever. Just be sure that there is always at least one active objective at all times.
sick.  thanks boss.

oh, any idea how long that takes?
somewhere around 24hrs iirc but I could be wrong
oh that's not too bad

I ran into a problem, my mission is so full of events and objectives, that there seems to be some conflict.

Is there a way to check the mission-file for conflicts/errors?  or do i have to remove every single objective/event?
Immediately after attempting to launch the mission, upload your player log.  To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Yes, the same legit path as the rest of the 5 boats in Uniform-Group, but checking revealed, it was in a non-existant echo group, which i corrected.. testing if it works, right now

Is the ship in a weird unit group, such as sharing with an aircraft?
👆
yes but he fixed that

Still? wadhuheck? will correct that (again)
okay even after saving the 2nd time it would not save removing the unit from echo via group-menue instead of unit-menue worked

does anyone know from how far away can the AWAX pick up enemy targets?
The AWACS radar is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar more powerful than any other radar. But otherwise, no, you can't estimate radar ranges for anything because of how many factors are involved.
oh okay, so there isnt a benchmark i can work with at all?

oh okay, so there isnt a benchmark i can work with at all?
An small change in the aircraft orientation can make a difference of 100nmi
No, you can't estimate anything. Only test

How do you add collisions?
you can't for MP
they're enabled for singleplayer

Not natively. But you can move the missions out of the folder, upload it, then put them back.
How do I do that?

Ye, that did it. There a good way to ensure the loop ends when something like an airbase is captured or is flipped team?

first map I finished up.. learned a few things, hoping the editor(s..?) receive some more updates https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2943390075
I'd like to turn it into something like dynlib for some co-op fun
I can walk you through the trigger code, but the hard part is placing every possible unit, and giving them all alt-spawns.

So just making sure, if you host a round and ban someone, your not blocking them just stopping from a rejoin on that one match? Sounds viable with a no late rejoin set as well.
> stopping from a rejoin on that one match On that *one lobby*, so they are gone until you fully rehost the lobby
I kind of feel like they should be forced to killcam watch until everyone dies... lol

Do we know if the dynamic liberation creator is on here?
Yes?
Is there a way to have this 1 life option enabled for one of the modes or should we stick to the host and ban as they die route?

Also, love the work you put into that scenario.
The problem with adding new variations is that it's already a lot of work maintaining 9 versions. If I make the change to one, I have to propagate it to all of them.

Is there no option to set a target's detection mode via event sequence action?
nope
but if its stationary, you can despawn that object and spawn another in its place with a different detection setting

Are they ground units, and are they in a group?
yes and yes
Ground units in a group will ignore default behavior and individual orders. They must be ordered to move as a group using a UnitGroup trigger. Or you can remove them from the group.

just double-checking, does the "player" triggered by option work for all players or just the host?
You mean objectives and triggered events? Those look for any player.
thanks

I want to make a mission where if the player destroy the target spawned in the random location, another new enemy spawns in random location and endlesslyrepeats.   the core part of this mission is spawning the enemy in random location at start, and resetting the mission by spawning it again in another ramdom location after the enemy is destroyed.

but there's an issue with the mission completion. If I assign the objective like this picture abd destroy the enemy, the enemy immediately respawns in the exact same position instead of switching to one of the other alt spawn locations.  Is there a way to make the enemy respawn in other alt spawn positions upon mission reset ?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#rerollaltspawn>
thank you so much! it did not appear via googling

I have tried that method.  I have added text messages for each conditional action editor ifs, and it randomly displays numbers 1~10 so the RNG is working fine.  However, spawning the enemy in event sequence just ignores force alt spawn and keep spawning in the exact same spot.  I guess it's bugged or the FAQ is outdated ?  Using force alt spawn in trigger works.
Make sure the force alt spawn happens while the unit is dead. You may need to put the spawn action in a separate node after the force alt spawn action.
it did it like this, as FAQ site showed

can you show the contents of the conditional action?
it had the same result when I didn't added messages to see if RND is working.
as I said RND itself is working according to the message.

can you post your player.log after testing it?
Where can I see the log?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

this is the log from the latest test. I think you should mainly look around 'MAD-4 Radar [4] forcing altspawn'

is it really a bug then ?
yeah
got it, at least now I learned the reason. I think I should go for spawning initial random enemies and then replaying the mission, or constantly spawning in the same location.

I wonder how this mission made endless enemy waves.  Since vtol vr don't allow to edit other's missions unlike many other flight sims i'll probably never know.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913955345
Enemies can be respawned. Objectives can be restarted. What part are you confused about?
Spawning enemies randomly among alt spawn points

https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#rerollaltspawn

Only your specific implementation is bugged. I'm looking into why right now. Have you tried it with other types of units? It might be an issue unique to MAD-4 Radars
Then I'll try it again today.
With other units

Is there a document describing the ai behaviour ? Path and parked are self explanatory but I don't know how exactly stayinradius, follow, and railpath works
Nope, sorry
`stayinradius` doesn't seem to work properly when I tested it. The units all piled up in one place. I have no idea how to specify the leader for `follow` `railpath` is deprecated. It was an old workaround an old bug. Don't use it.

I have 2 more questions :  1. Is it possible to display a global value in the tutorial message or anywhere else ?  2. I want to make a smart FARP point to allow rearm and repair the helicopter. There's repair vehicle event but is reloading the weapons not possible ?
> 1. Is it possible to display a global value in the tutorial message or anywhere else ? Nope. Best you can do is create a conditional action that has a condition for every possible value of the GV, and displays a different popup for each one
> 2. I want to make a smart FARP point to allow rearm and repair the helicopter. There's repair vehicle event but is reloading the weapons not possible ? You mean in singleplayer? Have you tried the "reset vehicle" action?

New question : can pick up mission be done by any vehicles or AV-42C only ?
Only AV-42C can pick up infantry. (So far at least. Likely getting a blackhawk someday)
Got it, I wanted to make a pick up mission for dragonfly as well.

infantries not randomly roaming around is pretty fatal to me but OK. is Baha doing something about code optimization ?
AFAIK he's always optimizing code
this game is already impressively optimized for a flight sim, I can't appreciate him enough

Do you mean the "Dynamic Liberation Solo" challenge mission specifically? Or just hosting a private lobby?
just hosting private lobby
my goal is making singleplayer AH-94 dynamic mission / campaign

Is that intended or just bugged ?
Pretty sure it's a bug
And yeah I'd call that one catastrophic. Not sure why he hasn't fixed it.

Does anyone have info on sam launcher ranges?
I know people have spreadsheets for some stats
I have one for radar power, but their launch range apart from a max value is very dependent on the aircraft RCS

yo, for a mission I'm working on there are 4 helos and 2 jet slots for players. I want to make it so two allied ai aircraft will take off and assist helos in place of player jets if no players occupy the 2 MPspawn 'jet' slots. what conditions should I have my triggers check for to see if a player is in a player slot for a jet or not? I know the 'alive' condition will =true for ai units placed in missions but not spawned yet, does it behave differently for players? do they only trigger as alive once a player joins that slot? or is a player technically alive until dead even if not spawned into the world?
Player Alive checks are only true if a player is alive at that moment. They do behave differently from AI alive checks.  But you can't have AI form up on Players in MP.
that's fine, they don't need to form up. just float around the map hunting air targets to take some pressure off the helos when other players in jets aren't around

Oh is there an event to change the amount of fund ? I couldn't find it.
Pretty sure it's under Unit -> MP Spawn -> Add Funds
But it's singleplayer mission.

I’m trying to have unlimited spawns until a missions triggers then set lives to 3. Is this possible? Can’t figure it out
Can global values be transferred to the next mission in campaign ?
No

No, i use that action to broadcast info throughout missions.

Well I've heard of it not firing for everyone in some situations, but I don't think I have a concrete example to investigate.

@Dutchy why did the tutorial message not show for everyone again?
we tested this, and for some it only shows for the host
So if you know of a specific mission where messages only show for certain people, I can look into it.

Having real trouble getting enemy ground units to move. I've tried infantry and the missile truck, I set them to 'path' and the 'defaultpath' is set to a path I made. I've tried making the starting node of the path the exact position of the unit, slightly ahead of the unit, slightly above the unit and same for the second point.   I made a friendly carrier move following a circle with no problems. Is there something different I have to do?
If ground units are in a group, they will ignore default behaviors and individual commands. They must be ordered to move as a group.
I'll try that, thanks

That was it, thanks! If I put them back in a group, how can I set path settings on the group?  Also, is there a way I can 'run' the mission from the editor without launching? It would be good if I could test that they move and see how long they take from the editor.
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#testwithoutvr>
Use a trigger action to order the whole group to move.

i have no experience with the mission editor but i kinda feel like trying to make a furball mission when i get home are there choosable levels of AI?
You can choose which aircraft they fly and what weapons they have equipped.
but AI behavior/difficulty is constant?

yes

I'm looking to create a mission that encourages communication between two groups of aircraft. I'm currently thinking of doing this by having an F45 with an A2A loadout, and 1-2 AH94s. The F45 will be performing CAP and marking targets for the AH94(s). I want the AH94(s) to utilize firing from cover, using GPS points provided by the F45. I want being exposed for too long to be a threat for the AH94(s), without making things even more difficult for the F45, and I want the F45 to have a job to do that doesn't require the AH94(s) to engage in A2A combat. Any ideas?
My current ideas are having VTOL bombers take off, attempting to damage a friendly carrier group or something similar. I might add some enemy fighters, but only giving them FOX 2s to make missile evasion easier on the helis.
Make use of the "Gets Detected Now" triggers.  Enemy only has short range detection (SAAW, IRAPC, maybe GAVs?). F-45 have to run slick or stay distant. AH-94 have to stay behind cover, getting GPS targets from F-45s, or using their radar.

not that I'm aware
I learned to do things without trigger events

1. I start at the bottom of the log and scroll up looking for an Exception. Here we find an `IndexOutOfRangeException` right near the bottom. 2. The text right above the exception usually shows the last thing the game did before the exception occurred. In this case, it was setting up the player spawns and slots. 3. The part here says exactly where in the code the error occurred. In this instance, I'm already aware of a bug in the `GenerateSlotDesignation` function caused by copying an AH-94 slot with 2 seats, then changing it to a different vehicle.
That bug is already fixed in 1.6 btw

In the mission editor how would I detect if someone goes above a certain altitude?
With a condition?
nvm found it

Oh? What's the unit referred as?
disregard, I glanced over it because it's called a "Anti-Air Artillery". The "Artillery" made me think of the usual Howitzer/Mortar definition, i.e ground units vs grounds units
Yeah it's the only AA gun in the game

How far away can a SAAW target an aircraft?
Radar detection ranges vary wildly. They are unpredictable.
I can check the unity for that later.  Since I can inspect all the stats in unity I'd like to contribute on wiki page. The weapons and enemy infos are so lacking.

Is it possible to duplicate a mission you have created in order to make minor edits and make a different version. Example: Made a guns only PvP and I want to make the same thing but guns and heaters?
I dont want to go and place all the same mission assets though
im an idiot lol nvm, there is a save as... option haha

In my mission I want an objective to fail if a unit is detected by radar with manpads along the path. This is not possible is it?
In a future update it would be cool if instead of unit group  > alpha > detected > enemy you could have a list of units to choose from like other variables
I don't understand. Who is detecting who under what conditions?

I don't understand. Who is detecting who under what conditions?
So the objective fails when any mp unit is detected by enemy.  My intention is to only fail when MP unit detected by a radar. I want manpads to spawn along the path so you must kill them without being detected by radar. But obviously the objective fails when the MP unit is detected by the manpads.  So this logic is impossible currently correct?
Set it so when whatever radar sees you, it fails

Edit condition in sequence events?
I don't think this is an option
I meant like entry/exit conditions in sequences

Can you give more detail what you’re trying to do?
But off the top of my head Else/ Else If conditional is probably your best bet. System > system > fire conditional action
Can't select the radar unit and have it say "detects > [player]"?

Can't select the radar unit and have it say "detects > [player]"?
nah
SAM launcher is not the radar

You mean having different spawns?
Yeah,  so imagine an enemy plane takes off flys to a zone and then randomly searches in that zone so flys different patterns and altitudes then when it’s fuel is low it lands refuels takes off again, or a different way if as the player flys into a trigger then it spawns an enemy plane or heli that spawns somewhere in the zone and again searches at different heights and patterns
So is their a way to spawn an enemy at varying attitudes

How to update my uploaded mission ? I'm not sure steam -> upload will update it or just create newer one

How the HELL does StayInRadius work in VTOL?
When I double click the new spawn it jumps to that spot but it’s only 1 unit their not a group , I have checked that I have sync group clicked which is but it still just moves one
You have to move one alt spawn at a time for each unit

@hijong park  Thankyou. With the stay in radius, what do you mean by cirulcar paths?  If I had an enemy heli and wanted it to spawn and randomly fly around how do I do that
Make a path with 4 points, and set path mode to smooth with loop checked. Then enemy will smoothly circle around 4 points
Is there a way to use the AH94 desert camo? I thought it would automatically apply with the biome

Is there a way to use the AH94 desert camo? I thought it would automatically apply with the biome
There's not a way to force it. The "desert camo" is just the REDFOR camo that's applied to everyone on Team B
I suppose if it's multiplayer you could make everyone on Team B

Assign? Are skins chosen by the mission maker?
taking from the steam workshop and what we have been told, yes
there will be proper skin support

Does sam launchers need to be in the same group with radar to operate or can radar automically help any sam launchers around it ?
When you go inside the SAM launcher, you select which RADARs feed it data

Does anyone know that if you use the "fire conditional action" to destroy player vehicle, and then have another event that changes player spawn when they die, will the second event pick the vehicle getting destroyed by command as death or no?

It should be considered 'is not alive'

So my "code" won't work?

@Sypwn how do u make the GAV 25 Bullshark take of vertically?
will the takeoff command in events be enough that it knows todo vertical takeoff or no?
It will always take off vertically, if possible. If the TWR is too low, it will either taxi to a runway (if on airbase), or do nothing (if not on airbase)

My New questions  1. If i destroy av-42c via event, will its  corpse last forever on the map ? I know there's static object for that but static things can't have alt spawns.  2.there is a condition for the units getting detected by ally or enemy which will be useful for making dynamic BGM, that transforms between peaceful and combat BGM. does getting detected event only works once, or work again if the unit got hidden and then detected again later ?
> If i destroy av-42c via event, will its  corpse last forever on the map ? No  > does getting detected event only works once Yes. Once a unit gets detected, it's "Detected" forever
Except players have a special "Gets detected now" condition that only checks if they were detected *this frame.*

no, it makes the slot unusable until lives are granted by a trigger
if you want unlimited lives, uncheck the "limited lives" box

One last thing regarding spawns. Allowed slots is how many people can use it as a spawnpoint?
I can't really launch into vr atm so there's no great way for me to test it
allowed slots is only for AH-94, and sets whether it can hold a gunner

yo does anyone know that if i tell an AV-42C to unload passenger's will it wait until it is on the ground?
dunno
alr i guess ill see then lol

should i upload it here?
first, search it yourself for that AV-42C
alr

i see it says something about not having an available parking spot and/or that parking spot not having a runway?
but it allowed landing in VTOL mode
My guess is still that the TWR is too low to vertical land

is that still too heavy?
no, that should be fine
ok, send the log

Anyone know why I can’t place spawn points on a carrier?

I want to force GAV-25 Bullshark always fly in hover mode so they would act like a psuedo-enemy attack helicopters.  At which velocity AI aircrafts stay in hover mode?
They don't
They only hover when taking off and landing, and that's done on rails

So I’m a fleet of aircraft, all in the same group, if one is on a path will all be or do I need to set them all to a path?
you need to order **the group** to follow the path using a Unit Group event action
How do I do that?

Thanks

I'm thinking the answer to this question is "no" but does anyone have a reliable method for having the player (or players, in coop) manually signal to the game to continue with events? ie: player needs to signal to av42s to drop their troops, up to player to determine when its clear or not, player needs to signal to the av42s manually to continue  Tried using a strobe light interaction event but that doesnt seem to work in MP
You have to be clever with the tools available. In the case of telling an AV-42 to drop off, you can check if a player is locking it with a TGP.

does any one know how to make custom skins?
Use a program like Blender, Substance Painter, or Quixel Mixer to paint on the provided FBX files. Then export the texture, and import it into VTOL VR using the livery editor in the mission editor's main menu.
ok

in the player's 'Using weapon' property, is weapon safety mode or not arming any weapons considered to be blank or 'NO WEP' ?

You have to extract the game files with AssetRipper, then manually convert the base mission to vts format.

Hello, I am sorry to bother and I bet this gets asked a lot. I just finished my mission, it isn't very big in fact it is very much a small quick mission. This is my first time trying to upload one of my missions to the steam workshop so I have no idea what I am doing. This leads me to my problem. When I try to upload it, all I get is an "ERROR LIMITE EXSEEDED". I have no idea what this means and I've tried to go online to see if someone else had the problem, but no one I could fine had the solution. Now I am here, what does this mean and how can I get passed it?
Is there any way to convert a workshop mission I made back into a mission editor file? I've formatted my hard drive and forgot I had all my mission editor stuff on there

Are you sure all mission and campaign images are `.jpeg`s and are under 1MiB?
You need to convert the image, not just change the extension.
Yeah just checked

is there a way to edit the default missions? I want to change the T-55 BFM mission to have guns only rather than missiles and guns
Not easily. You'd have to use something like AssetRipper and extract the mission files.
why wont these enemies fire their radar missiles until im within 6 miles?

they have only fox 3s no fox 2s

Did you re-select the new image in the campaign editor?
I fixed it. For some reason if the name of the pic was longer than 6 characters it would not work
Try putting force detection. That worked for me.

How many units do you guys usually put in large scale missions ?
Is there a way to define or force a livery for an aircraft in a mission?
Force Detected only makes them show up on players' nav

For players, yes, unless the lobby host overrides it.

Would making many alt spawn hurt performance much ? I tested my mission myself but it had been running solid
No, more alt spawns shouldn't have an effect on performance. But they do have a significant effect on the size of the vts file
I want more replayability so I have put more click labors

folks..  question re quicksave/ quick load triggers.  Im building a training mission with voice instructions.  Ive set an action to quick save in certain places, and also a trigger action tied to a cockpit button at certain times to quick load last save point  (to alow repeat of the last training section in case someone gets stuck and needs to listen again instructions) But when I test it -  the quick load happens perfectly, but the voice files dont play again... what am I doing wrong?  any tips?    Cheers!

Is it possible to convert an MP mission the SP without having to redo everything?
Yes, by editing the vts manually. But there is no tutorial, you'll have to figure it out. See the question from that FAQ about editing vts files.
Ok thanks

Thnaks. my training mission is a single player quickie already, are suggesting to test with completely new misssion? the other idea was what if I build a new replicated objective  / training section basically same as, that gets triggered instead of a quickload.. long way round, but..

When nobody have made a mission you want to play (single player randomized ah94 mission in my case) You are going to make a mission furiously.

yo, does the E-4 not communicate hostile aircraft info if it's set to 'engage enemies=true',  radar on, and it's set to orbit a waypoint? The E-4 in my mission won't broadcast any hostile ship info, even if you request bogie dope it just says 'negative'. which is weird because I don't ever remember having trouble getting the awac broadcast info to allied aircraft before in my previous missions. Is there some known bug regarding getting the awac to communicate or am I missing something I forgot to check?
I haven't messed with awacs much
Create an empty mission with just you, an awacs, and an enemy that spawns in after a few seconds. See if that works.

if i make a mission in the campaign mission editor i can still use it in mp right?
...what?
what is the "campaign mission editor"?

what is the "campaign mission editor"?
there is a mission editor, and a campaign editor
To make a multiplayer mission, you have to create a multiplayer campaign and put the mission in that.

really? i couldn't find the option when i was trying it in the standalone mission editor to set it as multiplayer, and when I googled it it said I had to create a mission in the campaign editor to do so instead
See the first question in the pinned FAQ, lol
ah i think then i misread

is there a reasonable do not exceed number of units for multiplayer?
mulitplayer one was set to av-42 and not f/a-26 so it wouldnt show the level id made
The performance impact is different depending on the types of units: Players > AI aircraft > Moving land/sea units > Stationary units  Dynamic Liberation usually has about 40-80 units active per sector, depending on intensity and dice roll.

Does having a bunch of Units on map but not spawned (not spawned until triggered) impact anything? I want to make a mission where someone can kill a unit at base and it will trigger a set amount of unit on the map. if they shoot a diff unit it spawns that set etc etc. would having all those units "on map" but not spawned in cause any stability issue? Also does the map size Have and impact? or can you go to max size and still be fine.
In my testing, unspawned units don't have any performance impact.

One is a high quality mission, the other is a base game mission

What's the "RailPath" mode for ground units?
To make your cursor a specific angle to place units, you can type a new cursor angle in the bottom right corner of the editor. To make things like path nodes, use the Measure tool from one of those drop down menus at the top.

I'm also trying to figure out a way in my scenario to make fighter escorts actually act as escorts only, and not fly completely across the map to engage targets. Any tips for doing so?
Maybe uncheck engage enemies
And set the path

If I force all AI aircraft to be undetected, will that make them essentially only target players?
The detected settings mean the unit will always be visiible in NAV, or not, or only when they are in your line of sight.

Is it possible to load up any of the official missions in the mission editor? It would be helpful to see how some of those were built/use them as a base for new missions.  Similarly, is it possible to load any of the official maps in the map editor apart from Akutan? I have been really enjoying the t55 border war map.
You have to use AssetRipper to extract the raw files, then manually convert them to vtm, vts, and vtc where appropriate. Others have done it, but there are no tutorials.
Thanks

How can I trigger an event when a player voices a command over radio?
Sadly there's no way to take inputs from the player directly
The most common way is to have them do some obscure thing (like turning on their strobe lights or locking a specific unit with their TGP) in order to trigger an event

allied ground support has reaming stations with assets, or invisible. should be there as well for team B. i assume this is a SP mission?
fair fair

yeah it does
but no, if the game is locked up and won't accept any input then there's nothing you can do

then take screenshots of your unit positions?
Wdym?
you're gonna have to redo your last 2 hours of work

you might be able to double click on the ground to teleport the cursor

how do i make it where some enemy air units will fly a path when the players on the other team pass a certain waypoint?
If passing that waypoint is an objective, you can put an action in the objective's complete actions section. If passing that waypoint is not an objective, you can create a triggered event.
yep i just figured out the triggered event, i was trying to do it with the timed event and didnt realize it was a timed event

Whenever I make a mission in a game, I tend to either make it either really easy and noob friendly, or seriously difficult where the average player has a tough time.  Is there any guides / tips on how to make sure a mission is balanced between fairness and difficulty? or can it only be known through making the mission playable?
There's a massive difficulty curve in being able to evade active radar missiles. If the mission has them, it's going to be hard for noobs (unless they throw themselves at the enemy endlessly). If you don't add them, then the mission is usually too easy for skilled players.  You just have to decide who your target audience is.

The gamemode functions pretty well as is but this would offer more intel to each team as to who is holding the point if they missed the pop up promt or something

So you really just want it to remember where it left off after switching to a different track and back? That's a more reasonable request to me.
Yes, so instead of a STOP BGM command, i would use a PAUSE BGM command

it ahs to be individually? i can't make a group do it?
Group actions only exist for actions that are guaranteed to be available to that whole group. Not all ships are drone launchers, so the "launch drones" action is not available as a group action.
After realizing that 'Stayinradius' behaviour is not randomly roaming around but just moving to X 0 and Y 0 coordiates,  I have devided the map in 9 sectors, made 9 extremely twisted bezier paths, and applied these to those 'random encounter' enemies in each sectors to make random roaming.  Not only it makes pretty good 'roaming around' effect, their constant changes in moving direction makes shooting turrets from over 4 Km away completely waste of ammo which is great.

Hello, I have a question, im trying to make a custom scenario  map to play whit friends, and i cant make the multiplayer plane spawn, i can only have 1 player spawn, is there a mod or another method to fix this?
First question <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ>
oh, thank you

How would I go about Self - destructing drones that were launched from their respective ships after the carriers are destroyed? Like, carrier 1 is destroyed, so carrier 1 drones self destruct.  or is that not possible?
Nope. Launched drones cannot be controlled. Which is why I don't use them.
The one time I did have to use them

can I not, like, use a "kill all" command / event when the carriers die?
dont think so
They don't show up in the selection, because they don't exist in any form until they are launched

which also bring another question, how do I make it so when the carriers spawn in, they don't spawn in their drones?
Hold up, are we talking about drone carrier drones or NFP carrier aircraft?
drone carrier drones

Hold up, are we talking about drone carrier drones or NFP carrier aircraft?
drone carrier drones
that the AI use

So in the event's spawn menu, If i select all enemy's except for the drones, it still spawns them?
the drones don't show up in the System -> Units -> Spawn action list
unless Baha changed it and I missed that

with the multiplayer move spawn event. If its to start immediately, with the entry condition of a MP slot / player not being alive. When the mission starts, and a slot isn't taken up, will it immediately switch spawn points? Or does it only switch if that slot has been taken and has ejected / died at least once?
It will immediately move the spawn point. Even if the players have selected a spot and are spawning in at the start of the mission, it will still move them because of <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#eventatstart>
(You can use that to roll random player spawns for a mission)

So i need to set a timer? So when the timer is done, they will at least be in the air
You should normally attach it to an objective
All present players take off, or form up, or something like that.

Ok, so if I have the Spawn change activating at the beginning of an objective to destroy something, it will then change it? Like this?
I feel like I'm missing context here. Why are you starting another objective as part of the Start Event of an objective?
And what does the "Respawn" event do? Move the player spawns immediately?

If you post screenshots of all relevant events and objectives, that will help a ton

For context, something weird which I've been doing is that whenever an objective starts, it's starting action is to begin itself. (this is prob a waste)  Also, yes, the "respawn" is the spawn change

Right now, the players will spawn with a locked loadout, but when the spawn changes, I want them to be able to change their loadout to their preferences.  is that possible?
you have to make separate slots, and unlock them later using lives
How fast do sea units move?

How fast do sea units move?
Depends on the ship. The wiki should list each one. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/DMS_Cruiser>
A sea group in formation will move at the speed of its slowest ship.

Is there a way to have it so when a player respawns in a multiplayer mission, they can spawn in a different location?   Like after Obj 1 is done, they spawn in the air closer so they dont have to fly 5 mins to get back to the fight
see pinned FAQ
oh sweet, thx

Add max speed to drone carrier page plz? <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Drone_Carrier>
isnt it the same as the DMS cruiser
so every other ship gets it's speed included but the Drone Carrier. Even the gun boat, rocket boat and mine boat get their own speeds. Why u disrespect Drone carrier 😦 lol

Tips on organizing things in the editor?
when using the Alt Spawn, if you wanted a building and 2 sams and radar to spawn in different locations how do link them so that whole groups spawns in the different spots,? with units you can link the squad but not with buildings and sams etc
Buildings (from the map editor) and static objects cannot change their location through logic.

Also is their a way to spawn enemy ah-94? will they add helis to the enemy and then allow players to jump into the enemy side to attack

But if you're talking about stationary units
have one of them spawn normally with an alt spawn. Put a waypoint at each possible spawn for it, then use a Conditional Action to check where it spawned, and Force Alt Spawn on the other units to match.

could you take a screen shot of the complete process? sorry new to creating missions thanks
It's 4am here and I'm trying to fall asleep.
Start with a sequence where you spawn only the first unit (Unit-1)  Then in the second sequence node, put a condition action. The FAQ explains Conditional Actions in the context of doing something random: <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#chanceaction> Instead of using Chance conditions, you use Unit-1 Near Waypoint Possible-Location-A/B/C conditions for each if. For the Do Thing action, you have it Force Alt Spawn for all the other units in the group to match Unit-1. Then you   Then in the third sequence node, you spawn all the other units.

im thinking about making an AC7 campaign, but i'm not sure if I'm allowed. does anyone know if that would be against the rules?

Is it possible to have it so, if a carrier's random spawn is in a group, it's Sea Group will become that fleets group? So like, if it spawns in the top group, it becomes sea group alpha, but if it spawns in the bottom, it's sea group becomes Bravo?
Are these 2 random spawn areas?
i'm about to set up an alternate spawn point for each

i'm about to set up an alternate spawn point for each
You could have an if-else sequence like so:  RANDOM(50%) - spawn group A Else, RANDOM (100%) - spawn group B

Is there a way to set a group speed for sea units? so they all move at like 15m/s or something?
wait, if a sea group moves as fast as it's slowest ship, then what if every enemy ship in each corner of the map is in the same group?
also, how di I fail a mission if an objective is failed? Does it happen when a required objective is failed?

Is it possible to check if the player has fired countermeasures for a conditional objective?
Not that I can see.
Me neither! Alright, I'll bodge it 🙂 Thanks

is there a way to select multiple units at once and move them or do i have to move them all one at a time?
I'm trying to make a recon mission where the player locks the target spawned in random area and let the artillery units to fire and destroy it.  But since artillery can only be assigned to use in the assigned waypoint instead of specific unit I can't find any simple way to achieve this.
Again, i am a moron.

question when i make a scenario on a custom map made for it and i update something on the map is there a way to add the updated map to the scenario because now i need to redo the hole scenario?
Can you delete the scenario from the campaign, then readd it?
@Mr.NoLife  There is a rebuild option to update the map in the scenario

you can launch it without your HMD

Afternoon all. Loving the game. Recently found steamworkshop and downloading various maps/missions/etc. Is it fairly simple to create missions? There was one in particular I loved - heading in, blowing up gnd targets, then picking up teammates from the roof of a building. Then go and search for a downed craft and pickup the crew, before returning home.
Would be great to be able to make an expansion on this. Like 5 friendly jets all heading in to evac ground troops while under fire. The SAR was very good too, apart from you didn't find crew on your own - there were waypoint markers
Daunting at first, but definitely not that difficult.

Oh, an ingame workshop mission? I was off searching steam for "killbox"
yes
imagine not using ends after your ifs

Like "call an airstrike at this location" type thing?
spawning the tanker and AWACS only in the last iteration
I made the entire thing time based at some point

Another quick Q. I can set infantry to "Board Aircraft" but only select an AI aircraft. Where's the option to board the player aircraft?
Use the Pickup objective
Ok, so I have objective "Extraction", Type: Pickup, Startmode: Triggered, Waypoint:LZ I also have an event "landed at troops", which is as above: (landed in radius of "LZ", parking brake set, doors open)

What objective type? They complete themselves under different criteria
Ah ha. I had "fly to" as the objective type but I can select "Conditional" and set them all in there. Ok, that works
Thanks for your help. That's worked really nicely

Do you think it's a bit too similar to the other chap's one to upload to the workshop? Or is there another way for you to test it
If you send the .vtm file, we should be able to load it and try it, but it'd be very easy for someone to plagiarise. So I'd only do it to people you trust
is that a actual worry in vtol?

how hard is it to make mission sin this game? I have some pretty cool ideas
I recently joined, and a made a 2-part mission in just a day. The UI is really intuitive.
Things all follow a logical flow, and you can make something playable very quickly

in game
theres a button on ur monitor, but i think you can also open it in vr

Hi all, I have a question if anyone has may have struggled with my same issue. I am having problem with sound loudness. So I record little clips in audicity and they sound fine through VLC or Windows Media (like they are loud enough) but when I got to play them in the game the noise is so quiet I can barely hear my words. Has anyone else seen this before? I have tried recording them thinking I did something wrong. Exported as OGG.
I am not hearing my intro clip and I am not sure if it is because with all the other game sounds I simply cannot hear when I started my mission or my trigger isn't firing. Having a hard time deducing which one it is at the moment. Thanks for any advice you might have.
It might be a steam vr issue

wait are you saying your playing audio clips through the game?
im confused
just my index during testing of my campaign

So you guys made a mod for this game then?
its not out yet
but there are a few other mods yeah

you guys do other games? normal stuff or VR stuff?
we only work together on vtol
maybe move to modding

I do have a question about unit management if someone might have an answer. I have Echo group of four planes supposed to be following my group (Sierra) to the objective but when the mission starts they just fly off path and go in circles. What did I do wrong?
Thought it would be as easy as make a path, tell plane group to follow that path to a large group of enemies and then engage enemies will kick in...was my thought...and hope.
You might need to use an event that starts at mission start to get them to follow the path. The initial stuff in the unit options is a little janky

When I try to upload my mission to Steam, it goes to 10% and then say Generic Failure. Any ideas what might be causing this?
too big of a mission maybe?

then updating it to a big one

What other assets does it use? Sound files? Images in the briefing?
I have one image for the briefing and one as the mission thumbnail. Neither are very high-res or anything.
How big are they, file-size-wise?

How big are they, file-size-wise?
If you post the game log, there might be something in it that gives a hint why it’s failing
a few hundred kliobytes only

is that the player.log shortcut in the VTOL VR folder?
That should be fine. You get several megabytes
Is the file the shortcut points to

Did you have mods loaded when you created it?
I believe I might have had the Nuke mod loaded for testing, not 100% sure tho
Actually no, now that I think back to it, I'm pretty sure I had it loaded

Yeah, agreed, tht does seem like a likely cause. Any ideas how I might fix this?
@Ketkev wrt yesterday’s stifled rant, ^
Not a clue. I’ve no idea what oddness the mod has put in the mission file

Hi all, may I ask those here willing to help...to help? I want to make an awesome campaign to play, something big like 8 to 12 missions. Anyway, I am not a game developer and have never tried anything like this before. I just added a new campaign "The Shlabovian Conflict" with the intro mission so I can learn. Would anyone be willing to play it and give me feedback?
I want to know how big (and by big I mean grandiose in terms action and objects) and want to know how big is too big? Also what is too easy and conversely what is too hard? So before I go to the masses or design multiple missions I thought I might try to get a handle on these things...even if just a little.
Thanks for any support you are willing to give in helping me make an awesome campaign for the community to play.

So I am not sure what happened in your game but when I downloaded it from steam and tried it, it worked as it did in testing. Mission launch, greeted by some audio, fly towards air base (see dog fighting going on), echo and kilo kill enemies over air base, 8 incoming bogies arrive and more dog fighting ensues, Overload warns about 16 more incoming fighters (at this point combat usually shifts towards the city in the direction the enemy came from as well as the river and ravine running through the middle of the island) which cues up some epic music...more dog fighting, upon victory...message from actual and RTB (required to land at base (though I think I need to specifically set a way point or something that shows the player to return to the base on the map)). So seems to work as expected for me. Maybe your download got messed up somehow?
probably a problem on my side then

Hey dude, tried your campaign just now. Just the one mission for now, right? Nice map, straight in the action, and nice to see wingmen ready to go too. I found the briefing audio was a little quiet and hard to hear - same with some of the custom radio messages you recorded. Also I found that I loaded probably the wrong setup (I'm a noob) so I had a few AAM all used up quickly but also a few AGM which I then didn't use. Ended up reverting to cannon sparingly. Still, completed and good fun.
Was cool to land at the base to see it pretty destroyed - looks like it took a beating

Makes me want to add radio and music to my mission. Or, better yet, convert to a campaign

I think it's a good idea - however what is your aim of these videos? Who's your target audience? Other people who are new to VTEdit and need help learning about it, or do you want to tell a story of your own development?
I really like your mission though. It's made me want to expand on mine and make a campaign, adding some story, music, and perhaps some voice acting by @Quantify  😉

Also, thought/question about an idea. A community campaign? Something checked into git hub that multiple people contribute to? Or we have one person make each mission? Then we call it VTOL VR : Ace Combat...A Shared Experience (or like A Community Experience)
its dumb. its dumb right?
I'm quite new to this but I think the technology doesn't allow that. Missions are attached to your steam account and uploaded to the workshop from that, so I'm not sure you could "commit" code into github, then somehow "update" in the workshop

Ahh thankyou

The third part of the mission (no spoilers) my wingmen seemed to stay behind. That intended?
they are told to flee as well so not sure what is happening there
They stayed engaged from what I could make out on the radar screen

When in development of a mission, you're often back and forth between mission editor on the pc, and headset ingame. If enabled, you will start at the loadout screen. Is there any other way to start at the Brief screen instead? We can only really see the briefing screen once uploaded to Steam

Oh i see.   What i did for kill box is make every actual objective not required. However, upon completion of each objective, it adds 1 to "win" global value. The master required objective (provide cas in this case) completed once "win" global value = 5.    I would make do something similar here. It wont matter which objectives are completed or in what order.    If you dont want to make multiple objectives and dont need waypoints, you can bake the selection into condtional success argument using ANDs and ORs + global value linked to which spawn like so:  In the action that spawns group A, also set a global value "spawn" to 1. If spawn group B, set gv to 2. C, 3 etc.  In excel formula format, the success conditional logic would look like this OR(AND(A=dead,gv=1),AND(B=dead,gv=2),AND(C=dead,gv=3))  Also, always be sure to trigger the objective AFTER the spawn and gv actions are fired. (Sometimes i use a 1s timed event as a standoff)

Great thank you so much for the advice. 👍 I was not familiar with the whole global values concept but will try some experimentation with them. I did think that having so many objectives was the problem so will try a new approach. One other quick question.... I have downloaded a map from the workshop and am using for a campaign in compiling. I have renamed all the bases in my editor but in the game the comms base names revert to the original map names. Do you know if this can be fixed or am I stuck with the original names?
Just wondered if you would consider making a basic tutorial on using global values in the VTOL editor some time. I am not from a programming background so don't really get the concept of how they can be used. From what I understand though they could be another very useful tool in mission creation? Just some basic concepts would be great.
Yeah, absolutely. I can make one today...later on of course after work. I'd be glad to help.

Quick question, did you rename the bases before or after you referenced the map in your campaign? If you referenced it first, then changed the names, you have to update the map your campaign uses. This can be corrected by updating the map under C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\[name of campaign]\[name of mission]\[name of map directory] and in that directory you will see your map and some different height maps associated to it.Then you'll see the [mapname].vtm, this is the file with the base names in it. You could also probably just change them in that file in a text editor but be mindful of editing game files outside the game editor (you can more than likely break it).
For my Shlabovian Conflict map, this is my folder with the same data
and my path to MY file is this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\The Shlabovian Conflict\Outer Shlabovia - Summer Isle

I also just released two scenarios the first, Mt Everest FF, is just a free flight map of the mountain and it's surrounding area. Some of the highest peaks are marked as objective waypoints, so I gues it's also kinda educational. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385398 The second on is called Nuke the City, and as you might guess, you nuke a city.

did you make them public?
I did. The links don't seem to be working, but you can just search "Mount Everest Free Flight" and "Nuke the City" on the workshop I guess

Does anyone have any ideas why my BGM music won't work in the mission editor. When I click the speaker to test the audio there is no sound and no music starts in the game when it is supposed to. I have custom radio messages working fine. I have tried MP3 and OGG files, short music clips, long music clips, nothing works. I uploaded some of the tracks into the main game audio files and can play them using the in built player so cannot understand why the mission editor won't play them?

Hmm, odd. Mine worked just fine. Simple MP3 file plays when you test it with the speaker icon. Is the file in the EditorResources folder?
@Judge_dredd Have you tried using a different file that you know plays, as the BGM? Like any other file (like your radio messages), just set as BGM as a test. If it works, it suggests there's an issue with the music MP3 file you're trying to use

Seems a bit odd that they would play in the music player but not in the editor. I can't imagine it having to different mechanisms for managing audio files. So it seems really weird for it to work in one but not the other. But I have never run into the issue before. I had an issue when trying to reference OGG files but that went away as soon as I started using MP3's.

The bug I found was when referencing an audio file...some times it break the save feature of the mission editor. Like I reference my MP3 audio file and when I go to save the mission nothing happens...it just sits there. I can't hit crtl + s either. Not sure why referencing an audio breaks saving but for me...this happens semi frequently. So I have adapted to setup my event the way I want it, save my mission, then try to reference the audio file. If it breaks, fully exit the game back to desktop and load back in.

is there a way to use downloaded  maps for custom missions?
Of course, once a map has been downloaded it should show up as an available map when starting the scenario or campaign
There could be a bug in the game regarding filename. Try shorting the filename and remove any spaces, symbols, etc. Just in case @Judge_dredd

Question: I'm running the public test branch. Do my uploaded missions only work on the same branch, or are they available to all?

anyone know how to make a carrier follow its path with formation with other ships?
stick them in the same group
and make the group follow the path

and will they keep the same formation?
more or less
I recommend trying it

When making a mission, do you have any rules regarding copyright and using of other brand names - like Coca Cola Valley Run / Microsoft Defender / BMW Factory Berlin Tour (just random examples) ?
Those would fall under fair use, because you're not profiting
Perfect, cheers 👍

About just stealing Coke's IP for your own stuff?

Jammo was asking if it would land the developer in hot water, but the content is hosted by Steam isn't it?
Yeah
I'd be careful with it but it's a bit of a legal grey area in terms of what exactly you can use everything for. Since it's your own content I don't know why it'd be shifted to the dev since Steam is responsible for the content they host

I am 100% sure that "I really want to" is insufficient reason to get a fair use exemption

So fair use doesn't apply to the above use anyway?
well, let me rephrase
the logos are covered by trademark and copyright law trademark doesn't have a fair use exemption because trademark protection is inherently limited to business uses -- it's for designating products copyright is more broad, but nonetheless has a fair use exemption carved out

How can I place bunkers? They are destructible, so I assume they're in the mission editor, but I can't find them under units or static objects.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385398925&searchtext=everest  Enjoy
They're a unit

With global vars in the mission editor, you can edit the numbers/variable counters, but are there any ways to make Timers?
There's the main mission timer, where you see the finish time, but it would be good to be able to have a custom timer that I can start/stop and edit too, like adding time to it
Not without wanting to die

Bear in mind, it'd be a series of several hundred steps, each waiting for 1 second, each incrementing a counter or something by 1, then... doing something with the counter afterwards? Horrible
ergh
maybe not then!

Plus a second question (2-for-1 special today): If a unit has multiple events/triggers/actions etc, is there a way to spawn an instance of this object (Object Oriented) so each class will inherit the same types/events/etc ?
No
Far less bodging room there

Anyone know of existing missions where enemy aircraft start out at a long distance?
Hey everyone! I'm making a fully voice-acted campaign for VTOL VR! Come check it out here:  https://discord.gg/tY4FH92rpJ
Damn I hate the sheer logic of the mission editor sometimes 😡

You hate boolean logic or how the VTEditor works?
Boolean logic!  it’s just too damn precise. You spend 2 hours putting together a complex mission, you’ve checked it thru several times. Then you launch and at first way point ‘mission complete’  .... i didn’t even get to shoot anything down  🥲 I know I only have myself to blame 🙄
Beautiful

What would you do with it? Apart from the one niche race/time trial case, I can't think of anything that couldn't be done with timer events
I have uploaded mission 2 of the Artemis campaign. Only 4 more missions to code 😰 ... currently 288 (random) mission objective combinations for missions 1 and 2.
still need somebody who natively speaks english to help me voice a campaign, its about 8 missions long and i could really use your help

Is there a way to make units engage only the ones you want? If I set them to do not engage then I set a designated target will they engage that?
You can set non-targets, and priority targets. If they’re not a non-target, they’re fair game, but they’ll go for priority targets first if they can see them. They’ll never attack non-targets
I see.

Is there a way to make an AI A/V-42C Hover at a certain point?
No
that sucks

are you flying the ASF towards the point towards where you expect the F45 to be?
using like, an orbit at waypoint command i think its called
Thing is, there’s no real way to know where the friendly wing is going to be, and waypoints can’t move to follow planes (afaik)

Wait, dumb question, but I expected RCS modeling to a swerling case 1 monostatic value. Is it actually modeled by angle and frequency?

Interesting! Thank you!

Hello! I was looking to setup a mission (on the F-26) that starts on a carrier, and I'd like to place the plane ready for takeoff, much like in the very first Over-G Fighters mission (gameplay starts at timestamp of video). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjlW1ptHPRk&t=60s Is it possible (yet)? The mission editor apparently only lets me place the player in parking spaces, and I'd like the mission to start with the plane flight-ready (which is simple) and ready to takeoff (having to just lower the launch bar could also work). By all means, tell me if I'm being a dummy and missing obvious buttons.
No
it is impossible to spawn the player on the deck or flying at 0 kn

Mh, thanks, I'll set it up so it's the closest parking to the cat - what is the default catapult, by the way?
default?
I don't see what you mean by default catapult

now that i think about it, are there any other missions with the independence day units on the workshop?
im pretty sure you can just modify the mission file to have the name of the J4 fighter instead of some asf aircraft to spawn it
If I have a group set to spawn due to a trigger but every unit in said group is **NOT** set to spawn immediately (as in they will not be active/spawned in the world on scenario start), will they still spawn just fine or must I have atleast **ONE** unit in the group active when the trigger is called for the rest to spawn?

If I understand you correctly, they'll spawn just fine
exkuse me guys how do make spawn mision edit

The mission is Complete when the last active objective is completed. What objectives do you have at the moment?
Hello, guys! I am currently planning my first mission, and I am wondering if there was a conditional to force the player's radar off
i mean, you could probably fail them if they turn it on i guess

Does anybody have any solutions or ideas?
It is not possible to force the radar off
If i place an aircraft carrier

how do i make it the player spawnpoint?
Place the player spawn on it :p
units - player iirc

i believe if you click on the carrier and go to its settings you can set it there?
i may be wrong, it has been a while
oh yes ur right

does navigate to waypoint with the aircraft carrier make it park at the waypoint have automatic collision avoidance?
i cannot remember, i am sorry
it should park at the wpt

do you know what these options mean?
force detected - visible to units no matter what
force undetected is ditto

Is there a way to see the radius??
like so that i can see the sphere
Force Detected has no effect on allies. Force Undetected has no effect on enemies

Force Undetected is for if you want a friendly unit to not appear on the Nav map till you detect them, like the lost pilot on The Island: Redirection(?)
Ships have no path finding or collisions. They will happily sail underground
How can i force an aircraft carrier landing on an aircraft carrier that has landed?

How can i force an aircraft carrier landing on an aircraft carrier that has landed?
like an objective
bc in my scenario the aircraft carrier moves

Not sure what you mean. Whilst playing the mission? No. In the editor, the radius often appears when adjusting it in the objective
I'm not going to say it always appears, but you'll see a coloured circle around the chosen waypoint whilst moving the slider
I've found the same, where adjusting the radius doesn't show the radius. Would be useful to see this

Also since my scenario is multiplayer, will an aircraft carrier spawn work? because i heard someone say me and my friend will spawn in each other
*shrug* Sounds like a #modding thing
I mean its kinda both

So when making a mission, is there any way to add custom voice lines to play at triggers or something?
Yup. Look in the System actions
Awesome

does that mean all the other objectives have to be completed?
Could someone explain how the start mode final works?
I think it triggers if all the other objectives are resolved, but I’m not sure if they need to be completed successfully or not

Could someone explain how the start mode final works?
I think it triggers if all the other objectives are resolved, but I’m not sure if they need to be completed successfully or not
because... it just didnt trigger and made my second to last objective have the popup with finish mission n stuff

How are you activating the second to last objective?
If at any point there’s not an active objective, the mission will complete
Even if of only for a single tick

Hey guys, i've noticed that if you restart a mission from the death screen, it doesn't appear to fully reset everything. Incoming fighters in my mission were where they were at when I died, and some events wouldn't trigger. Any Idea why?
I think it is because you crashed (plane) and you restarts your plane meaning you restart your mission
hey real quick when I try to upload a mission to the work shop it says I haven't accepted the workshop agreement... Even though I have. Anyone else had this?

for the second one in my measurements its 9 degrees

Hi People, looking at events in mission editor. I get triggered events and get timed events, I look at Sequence Events and can't fathom what you get different to timed events. There's Entry Condition and Exit Condition but not sure what these do/how they work. Anybody explain difference between Timed and Sequence Events and how Entry/Exit behave in sequences?
sequence events are a list of actions that will be triggered in order

the entry condition is all of the conditions required to be fullfilled for the specific event to start, and the exit is the same, but for the event to end and go to the next start condition

I'm having a problem with the "Take Off" command for an NPC AV-42C.  I have a long event sequence with several roof top landings and take-offs to simulate a troop assault on a building.  The first two times I use the "Take Off" command the AV-42C does a vertical take off.  But for some reason the last I use the "Take Off" command the AV-42C attempts a conventional take off from the roof, which doesn't work out well.  Is there a way to force the NPC to take off vertically?
it should automatically take off vertically if not at an airbase
thats probably a bug

Always a full load of passengers?
I reduced it to 3 passengers.  Was 5.  But fewer passengers didn't change the outcome.
It seems to be rotating the nacels way to soon.  Sometimes it starts with them vertical but I have watched them rotate to horizontal while its at full AB but before the wheels have left the ground.

is there anything that could potentially be "above" the aircraft?
Sequence is 9 nodes long.  Maybe 15 actions.  This is the last one.
by which i mean, structures

How do I do that in the editor?
It’s automatic when you gets a new objective
Huh

How do I get rid of the waypoint when the destroy interceptor objective activates?
In the new objective auto select a new waypoint. If  the previous waypoint was a gps point I think the player has to clear it manually
@Brady  In your Objective Editor: - Objective Type: Destroy - Start Mode: PreReqs (I use this to ensure all previous objectives are done first -> "This Objective has *prereq*uisites") - Waypoint (You can set a location, or allied/enemy unit) - Auto-Set Qaypoint: TICK this so your nav screen and HUD will guide you to the right area - Required: TICK

What if you don’t want the target waypointed? Or anything waypointed?
You could set nothing there? As long as you set the target in the right-hand menu (destroy these targets to complete objective)
And that gets rid of the current active waypoint for the player?

Ah I see the issue (I'm a bit slow today). So progressing onto the new objective, if no waypoint is set, it will keep the previous one?  - So this could be a feature request / bug, that when no waypoint is set, navigation and hud markers clear to *no* waypoint - Or you set a new waypoint which is indiciating the general area/vicinity for the objective. ("Fly to the north and finish off the enemy last seen around that area")

You can set "Waypoint: NONE" and perhaps if you "Autoset waypoint" too, this will clear the marker for the pilot

Do you have ASF 30s or ASF 33s already created?
I don't think  so.

Should I have?

Also can a campaign include missions on multiple aircrafts? I want to include some objectives using anti-ship missiles using the F/A26B and some stealth missions using the F45A.
Campaigns are built for a specific aircraft, so no sadly.
Using the UI, no. I believe some people had some luck hacking the campaign files in a text editor, but I can't recommend it

hello, is there a tutorial somewhere for the conditional trigger system?
maybe even something about making stuff happen randomized
there is RNG, only for spawnpoints though

I guess it is not possible to restart a completed objective?
I kinda figured out how to "randomize" things, but I would have to do it in every completed objective again...
Nope. Pretty much everything is one-shot

but I need to do the "if then else" for 10 Objectives for every objective? there must be an easier way.... right?
nope
isnt there a way to "call" an event that does the "if then else" stuff? (the conditional action)

isnt there a way to "call" an event that does the "if then else" stuff? (the conditional action)
Sure. Once
It's not even going to be a pleasant if then else thing, because you've got to filter out the objectives that've already been done

joystick settings?
Also, this is #mission_editor

Is there an airport editor or something like that for the airports like there is with the aircraft carrier?  When my units are parked at an airport and I give the Take Off command, the AV-42 and F-45s always attempt a vertical take off.  I want to start them heavy and my F-45s are having a hard time getting off the ground.
If it is in the hangar or tent, it will horizontal take off.
If they’re too heavy to take off vertically, they’ll take off conventionally

Hey. I'm very new. I have a little question. Is there a way to start the mission editor without using the vrheadset?

Oh, never saw this xD

Hey guys, i have one question, can someone explain me how the "fire conditional condition" works and quote one exemple of it? Not only the rng usage
In context?
Whatever context, because i guess i can use it instead of use some timed or triggered event but didnt mess with it yet

I mean where are you seeing it?
The mission editor is a big place, and I'm not sure what you're referring to
For exemple, if i Want To use only the if condition (if group tango is landed near waypoint because they are on a carrier in movement = new action is take off) Will it works? Or i have To put else if ou else

For exemple, if i Want To use only the if condition (if group tango is landed near waypoint because they are on a carrier in movement = new action is take off) Will it works? Or i have To put else if ou else
You mean "Fire Conditional Action", or is there a "Fire Conditional Condition" somewhere?
You don't need to fill in the else

You mean "Fire Conditional Action", or is there a "Fire Conditional Condition" somewhere?
You don't need to fill in the else
But you'll only be able to fire the action once, as you'll only be able to fire the event that fires it once

Yep sir, that the way i use it, with global value, so we cant use conditional condition To get the same result ?
You might be able to. I'm just not sure why you would
If you held a gun to my head and ordered me to do it, I'd put a Fire Conditional Action in the Complete actions of each of the three objectives, and each of those Fire Conditional Actions would be identical

Is there a limit to the number rearm/refuel points that can be active on a map?  I have multiple "rearm/refuel point A" spots on my map.  I landed at one, engines off and weapon arm off, but the rearm won't work.  Coms -> ground -> request rearm comes back with "negative, ground crew unavailable".
theres no limit other than like... you spawning 1 billion and it runs at 2fps
did you enable rearming in the mission settings?

did you enable rearming in the mission settings?
Maybe not.  How do I do that?  I was also running with Force Equips turned on, maybe that was the problem.
I unchecked "Force Equips" and I'll give that at try.  One more question, what's the "Bullseye" waypoint for?

I don't think it is excessive in any way but maybe I'm wrong.  I spent quite a long time working on it, embarrassed to say how long.  Hoping other players can fly it.
Never mind, looks like the problem was the images were to large.  I think I read somewhere they need to be under 2MB.  I shrank them down and the upload worked.  Give the campaign a try and let me know what you think:  The Canyon War by Hard_Reset (sirmac5 is my son's discord user name.  The accounts are all messed up in our house).

Is there a trick to setting up the oil rigs so that they can be destroyed by enemy units?  I am trying to set up a protect objective for the player to protect the oil rigs, but can't figure out how to get the enemy units to target the rigs.  Thanks.
A janky way of doing it would be adding a bunker or two on top of it, and if it destroyed, the rig falls
@sirmac5 you can use the bomb waypoint command potentially

Hey, so when making a mission to be used with the multiplayer mod, is there anything in particular that needs to be done? Where do the additional players spawn in (do I just need to make sure there are enough spots or smthn)?
they spawn at airbases/carriers
So I just need to make sure there is a spare slot on a carrier?

So I just need to make sure there is a spare slot on a carrier?

I have a question when you create a mission with combat operations how do you balance the enemy to the ally... I mean do you have an ally, one enemy jet or an ally against two enemy jets... ?
Play testing
I personally err on the side of easy, but it’s entirely up to you

Hey, trying to figure this out myself and I think the answer is no, but is there a way to trigger an event multiple times? Like could I have an event trigger every time the player is in proximity to a way point, and if the player enters and exits the radius it would retrigger if they reenter. So far I haven't been able to get it to work but thought I'd ask.
Trying to make SAM radars turn on and off based on proximity
not really

I have a question, so I'm trying to make my wing men takeoff with me at the beginning of the missions, I set the "start action" on my Takeoff objective to command the Unit Group to takeoff and it seems to work just (the lights and engines turn on) however instead of taking off from the airbase I have them parked at, they instead perform vertical takeoffs which take forever. How do I get them to takeoff from the runway?
they also fail spectacular and end up flipping over beacause of all the weapons they carry which is pretty funny to watch
nvm it turns out they have to be inside the tent not in on the assphault outside the tent

Hello just wanted to express my thanks to Baha for this game. I luckily stumbled across it after buying a VR setup and PC for microsoft flight simulator but now have far more hours on VTOL!   Please keep doing what you're doing, wishing you continued success.  I am now starting to experiment with the mission editor which is a great feature, I wondered is there anywhere that shows the ranges of the various radars and missiles (specifically I am looking to compare the different surface to air missiles)?  I couldn't find this info online but wondered if it was visible in a config file or something.    Secondly will it ever be possible to program allied aircraft or ships to launch cruise missiles against targets?  I couldn't find a way to equip it in the loadouts and looks like others have found the same.  Thanks!
allied aircraft can launch the cruise missiles to follow a gps route in a scripted event
i believe its only one of the cruise missiles tho

Can anyone explain to me how to get enemy tanks to move on the mission editor?
you can make paths for AI to follow, and then select the select tanks to follow that path
I don't really know how to explain it but it got something to do with paths

does anyone know how to change the measurement to nautical miles? I don't know meters very well lol
american type beat, ya know
...oh and can I change the alt to feet?

...oh and can I change the alt to feet?
I literally just spent the past two hours making a mission and my VTOL crashed
and saved

what happens if you command a non-vtol aircraft to take off and they are nowhere near an airbase?
im hoping they just try to take off in the direction they are facing
but i highly doubt it

I don't remember but isn't a mission somewhere in the game in vtol to land on a sort of road somewhere?
For like a sort of FARP I think?
I don't remember a mission like that, but with the AV you have to land in a field once and with the 45 you have to land at a small FOB

For like a sort of FARP I think?
I don't remember a mission like that, but with the AV you have to land in a field once and with the 45 you have to land at a small FOB
One of the f45s mission has you land at a farp. But that is only the player, not the AI

When its like this, the next objective starts at the same time as the radio message when the objective is completed. Any suggestions on how to create a delay?
nvm I figured it out
For future knowledge-seekers, you'll need to measure the length of your audio, and start the objective on a delay. Actions are non-blocking, and all action in the same trigger happen one after another on the same tick

Is there a way to force an AI controlled av42c to take off horizontally instead of vertically?
start it in a hanger, or somthing else obstructing it vertically
or give it a loadout that makes its TWR < 1

Would anyone know anything about radio transmissions? I'm trying to get them to play one after another but they either A. Cut each other off or B. Don't play at all
You’re either going to have to play all sounds in sequence in one transition, or play them all in an event sequence, where each one has a time delay
I'll give it a go in a bit. Thanks :greatstory:

Does anybody know how to get the troops to dismount the aircraft after it lands at a certain point?
I've never tried it, but its probably under units/AV42C in question/unload passengers
@Dinner Plate I'm sorry I should have been more clear. I have the AV42 as an AI aircraft part of a scenario that is off loading troops. It lands at the designated spot, but only one troop gets out and he just stands there lol

try selecting all of the individual units?
This is what I use for my AI dropoff in Securing Fjorway: Foothold, the best selling AV-42 campaign, available from all good Steam Workshops
The important point is that there's a Rally waypoint set, and I'm not immediately telling the AI plane to take off again

Question about Campaigns and Steam Workshop:  If I publish with just one mission (for feedback, etc) and then I add more missions and publish again, will everyone get the new missions automagically?
Missions and campaigns are two different things
You'd have to publish a campaign containing one mission

I'm really enjoying creating and testing missions.  I had a situation yesterday where after I refueled, enemy air craft just disappeared.  I'm assuming if I use the Objective type of "Refuel" and then start another Objective that spawns enemies afterward, that would fix it?
Enemy aircraft shouldn't just disappear. If you've got a mission where you can reproduce that, drop it in #public_testing for baha to fix
The disappearance was when the Objective type was Land - I don't know if that makes a difference to you.  I'll test again tonight.

And refueling/rearm stations should also not effect AI?
Assuming you mean the FARP structure things you can place down, they should not affect the AI
It was when I chose to refuel that the current Objective finished and I got the message in my left hand.  Then it went to the rearm/refuel screen and when I came back to the cockpit the AI aircraft was gone.

I assume "the message in my left hand" is the mission complete screen?
Yes
The objective complete requirement is the destruction of the AI aircraft

anyone know if I can make infantry units walk right into a bunker (so basically through the walls, since there are no usable doors afaik) using a path, and if yes, will they die if that bunker is destroyed?
Yes and probably. Paths let you do what ever you want, if you want to get sufficiently fiddly Land units don't block each other in any way. Bunkers require large weapons to die, and anything that can kill a bunker would also kill infantry nearby.
you might as well just remove the infantry once they are inside tho

so i'm completely new to VTOL VR editing, should I drop my link here to get tested and get feedback on?
You certainly can

Any pointers on paths for ground vehicles?  Do the path points need to be on the ground or within a certain distance of the ground?  Do vehicles have a maximum incline they can traverse?
there are literally no limitations
vehicles can fly using paths

Do they have to be very near the first point in the path?
I'm having trouble getting some tanks going along a path, I'll keep playing with it.
Thanks

sorry im back from birthday celebration :)) im glad you enjoyed it and now im thinking of what things i could do to make it a bit more interesting.. more things flying around? more difficult??
does anyone know how well objectives and trigger events work in MP?
to my knowledge, everything works as though the host is the singleplayer player

someone who knows anything about what they're talking about can probably say something with more vigor

if I simulatenously tell a parked AI aircraft to take off and to do some other task, eg to attack a certain target, will the take off and then immediately go to doing that other task, or will it just bug out?
i believe if you tell them to do somthing that requires them to be flying, they will automatically take off
but i may be mistaken

has an update to mission editor occurred? and busted it. editor no longer responds to mouse clicks/scroll wheel. Similar in map editor. list boxes spilt over box edges
You stable or public_testing?
Reproduced in public_testing

There is a ground unit behavior called "follow".  How is that used?  I don't see a place to define something to follow.
Also, is there a random despawn mechanism for ground units if the player is far away?
And by despawn, I mean the unit will spontaneously get destroyed.

no

I've used Path because it has you set the path that you want the unit to follow.  If I set the behavior to Follow, it seems like I would select another unit to follow but I don't see that.  Maybe this is a future thing?
I suspect Follow makes the unit follow another unit in the same group in formation
Just checking now

How can I view triggers visually in the mission editor?
If I can at all?

Triggers are basically an if condition

I've made a quick tutorial for the F/A-26B as I felt that the default in-game ones were a bit... lacking.

Is there limit to how many units can be in the mission at any given time? I have some units placed but the do not show up when testing the mission
there is no hard limit

I've had random unit spawing issues as well.  I've found spawning them later fixes the issue. (spawning with timed event or proximity, etc)
Is there a way to run a mission from the editor in some form of freecam mode without having to go into VR so you can make sure the units are doing what they're supposed to etc?

push insert when you load into the aircraft
then i think its [] to switch aircraft

is it really that time again?
Just a straight timer? Would that even be useful?
idk i use the time sequence a lot for making mission.

i've often pondered time delays in mission editor. As an objective type you could have player wait. But i think better if the Trigger event actions (which fire all at once, when event is triggered) had time delays on them like Timed event actions. This would provide more flexibility. as it is I find a use a trigger event to fire a timed event to get a delay - seems cumbersone.   As Skumby says access to a game timer - starts at zero and counts time (say in seconds), then use conditionals to test timer value ... timer > 100, timer between 200 and 300 etc. and trigger events Conditional editor already exists, just need a timer.  with globals can do durations too  @BahamutoD suggestion for an easy add for a future release?

Russia must think I’m gonna invade or something

So I've got two opposing naval forces with carriers. They're both far from their waypoints. I've noticed there's no command like "navigate to unit/unit group" How should I get the aircraft to navigate to the other naval force wherever it is on the map and have them be free to engage the other side's aircraft?
set them to engage enemies
and set a path that interesects or stops them nearby (10-25km id say)

if you can't see the whites of the other navy's eyes is it even naval warfare?
exactly
if you're into that then sure

Problem: this fighter just sits there rather than taking off. It's got a command to take off. What might be the problem?
I've re-checked the logic of the mission. Is it that F-45s just can't take off horizontally from that position?
I think that might've been it. Swapped their starting locations with a couple of Kestrels and it's all working fine now

Nope, now it's happening with the fighters at the rear. Would appreciate advice

time for a dumb question! How do objectives fail? EG If have objective to fly to waypoint XXX, objective completes (successfully) when player is close to XXX. so objective is 'live' until player arrives. OR is it that scenario needs some other event to explicitly fail the objective (under whatever condition that tirggers the event)?
Well normally what you would do to fail an objective you would first create a trigger, timed, sequence event and select the action within it and select objective and click on the objective and fail it. But I have a feeling that you are trying to ask something else.
@Red Elite no not asking something else. was just looking at objective and registering (the obvious) how it completes successfully, but that made me think where's condition for fail. Its not in objective! So realised it must be elsewhere viz choose action to fail object in a separate trigger, timed, sequence event. Thks for confirming

What is the best way to put a KC tanker in the air for refueling practice? I tried placing one in the editor in the air with decent enough height (I THINK) and speed but it seems to just crash straight down into the water. Can this be done or does it have to start from an airbase and takeoff?
Send a picture of the stats of the aircraft in the editor
Not near the computer right now. Is there something particular you are looking for?

Maybe, I have never heard of it literally falling out of the sky, but you might have not done something properly
Ah, wait, I have it following a path!! Is path maybe only for naval and/or ground units? Perhaps it dove down to the path. Its hard to debug things while mission editing cause there is no way to spectate things.

Or at least not easily
Paths can be followed by anything

Is the altitude for the path set properly?
Remember that a path overrides the altitude
which is how you can make units fly when they are not supposed to (RailPath)

Oh, what is a path really for?
it will aim for ASL 0
Maybe I'm using it incorrectly.

On a new event there is a "start immediately" or something but then a timer value. So is that like trigger at mission start plus x seconds?
No
start immediately starts the event as soon as the mission loads

Ok, then what is the timer on the actions? Is that between each action or something?
And is it before the first action or after the first action?
The timer is independent for each event

And is it before the first action or after the first action?
The timer is independent for each event
it is relative to the load of the mission

Does anyone have a good explanation of how to put a tanker into a nice orbit for refueling? I used an orbit point but that didn’t work out too well plus the tanker did not adhere to the speeds I put in.
I’d have it orbit a waypoint, but with a really huge radius so you’re not having to pull 3G just to hook up
The speeds in the editor are all in m/s, so you’ll have to do conversion if you’re used to thinking in knots

Do you know of a good radius?
Nope. You’ll need to play with it to find a decent value
Thanks, will play around!!

Have you tried just reattaching them to the carrier again?
Are you actually attaching them to the carrier?
Or just spawning them really close?

Does anybody have any insight to why I'm suddenly unable to upload an image to scenario description on the edit tab? The file is 800 kb which is an appropriate size and a PNG file. I haven't had any issues before, and just out of nowhere it won't save the image after I upload it.
Post the player.log file. There’s a shortcut to it in the VtolVR program directory
@Skumby

Can you restart the game, try to to change the image, then quit, and post the log, so there's less other stuff to sift through?
Ive tried that many times...including resizing and using an entirely different image and format
did you modify the file directly via notepad or something?

did you modify the file directly via notepad or something?
Oh i see what youre saying, standby

are you telling the ai to bomb a waypoint without assigned a waypoint?

Regarding "Form on Pilot": I used this to have an AI pilot (wingman) form up on another AI pilot (leader).  Later in the mission I tell the wingman to go orbit a waypoint and I send the flight leader elsewhere.  The wingman does neither and just kinda flys around.  I've tried also setting the Form on Pilot to none but I get the same behavior.  Thoughts?
Is there a way to influence future missions in campaigns? For example if a carrier is sunk in the present mission it does not get put into the next mission?
No

Damn. Well then I would have to fail the objective if one of them dies. Thanks tho!

How do I set up a map for MP? Like do I just set the player (as with single player) and does the game just figure it out?

To fire on a waypoint that is.
Pretty damn far. You’re more likely to be blocked by terrain than range

hey quick question in for the mission editor, what is detection mode?
it says whether you need to see/look a unit to know where it is, or its just always shown on your nav map
i think theres a third option, dont remember

How does that work with the shiny new detection code?
I don't think the new method handles the force modes yet
I'm struggling to get these 4 units to move along a path in a convoy. I set them down in the marked order in a line on the road, add them to a group and tell the group to navigate a path (via a Event), however the launchers pull to the side and the radar truck closes the gap.

What formation have you told them to use?
i haven't found such an option yet, i might be blind

Only the fa26 and example scenarios work

@BahamutoD above log - new radio knob breaking the game loading in some way? Mission editor stuff, followed by a load of multiplayer stuff
Long shot - if you're able to fly the fa-26 in other scenarios, try giving all the radio knobs a good twiddle, then exit the mission and try your mission editor scenario again
My theory is that their state is messed up in your pilot config, and changing it will hopefully fix it

how does one make aircrafts placed on carrier deck in editor take off in sequence when mission starts?
go to editor events
go to the carrier

Does anyone know if there's a way to use triggers or something to turn on and off various aircraft functions? For example, turn off engines from a waypoint proximity trigger?
I don't think you can tell aircraft to go cold mid-air
but you can use a trigger event for everything else

Building a scenario where I have 2 bombers taking off from airbase as player approaches for landing. Player requests ATC for landing and bombers go to crap. Player log says they're holding short of runway - what's seen is first bomber sitting on end of runway (not lined up for takeoff) , and other bomber sitting on grass adjacent to taxiway. Player lands and once clear of runway, first bomber taxi's across the grass and crashes into a hanger.   Take off events for bombers triggered by player proximity to airbase. I think player ATC request for landing is 'blocking' bombers taking off (conflict for runway).  Is there a way to force AI bombers take off to have priority  over player ATC request to land? Ie player gets told "can't land yet" or similar?
sadly i don't think you can change ATC Priority.
Which map's this on?

Maybe you can ask the player to request clearance if the second bomber is above 30 knots?
players always have priority unless the ai is already on aproach or on the runway
Skumby - my own map.  derbryler - nice suggestion but players are notoriously independent.  Overlord - I suspected as much, but you've got my solution. instead of having the ai parked on apron waiting for player approach, i'll park them on the runway just after player departs.  Thanks all

Is there a way to look at Workshop scenarios/campaigns in the editor?  Just want to learn about the different capabilities and honestly help beat a mission by understanding all the parameters.
it'd be cool to be able to "remix" campaigns
You can't open up a scenario again. It spills the magic juice back into the air and mission won't work anymore

Was the encryption by community request? Seems odd to not want missions open source. Also potential for malware..?

can you put people on boats?
I have confirmed, you cannot put people on boats
I've tried this too (put people on boats) ... it doesn't work. I wanted to have the 42C fly from land base to carrier, pick up people, and fly them to some where else. But you can't have people on boats. I tried taking people to boat and have them get out - they don't don't get out.  It all goes to what Bahamuto thinks the game is about - people on boats is a long way from flying!

I thought this was just about the editor thought?
Well I guess the more you know.
And no that doesn’t work some times. But I don’t want to get into it.

So, I'm new to this, and I wanted to figure out how to create a mission where the parameters were, you infiltrate a enemy-held airspace to sneak in and shoot down a bomber (In-universe holding a high-ranking official), that's escorted by 2 fighters. Is that doable and if so what are the steps?
First I would lay out the map you imagine. Then I would add the bomber with the escorts. You should put them in the same group and let them follow a Path you designate so you can decide if it flies close to your airspace or deep inside their own.
Then you should add SAM sites. With a radar and launchers on high positions. Then you have to decide if you want a wingman or go solo. And you need to add an Objective and set it to destroy, set the bomber as target. But I think you should do how you feel. Just add some things, play the mission and add stuff you felt was missing.

I'm looking to use a way point proximity trigger to spawn in an enemy aircraft, and each time you fly through the way point a craft will spawn so long as there are no enemy aircraft still alive. does anyone know a way to repeatedly spawn in aircraft like that without having to place tons of them, basically just using one asset to respawn it over and over again?
sadly i don't think you can do that.
There are custom missions where the bandit respawns when you fly to at least 9100m ASL so I think there may be some way to do it though

Alright, welp.. Do un-spawned units have a noticeable impact on performance while un-spawned? I'm about ready to put in this work lol
It does have some impact as far as I am aware
its negligible

Can trigger sequence nodes be activated repeatedly? Or do they just trigger once and they're done?  For example, I'd like to use the radio knob to set a global value based on it's volume output, 10% = 1, 20% = 2, etc. Then when global values equal a number and your landing lights value = 1, spawn a set type of craft based on it's corresponding global value. I can get the dial to set global values once, but then when I come back to those volume based values nothing seems to happen. Trying to make a volume knob selector switch that changes global values associated with different types of craft to spawn in using landing lights as the trigger to select your choice from the knob. Basically in plane ai spawn controls, but I'm not sure a trigger sequence will work the way I'd like it to. Any ideas on a work around, or if this is even possible?
triggers can only work once
nothing repeats

I also work with global values and so far I use seperate events. That means I have a buttload of triggers. Maybe you could set up multiple triggers and increase the value each time you activate it. So group one activates with global value 1, group two with global value 2 and so on?
That might just work, I'll see what I can come up with later today. Thanks for the help guys!
Once I upload a Campaign to the Workshop, if I need to make a change, how does that change get to the Workshop?

Once I upload a Campaign to the Workshop, if I need to make a change, how does that change get to the Workshop?
If I upload from the Mission Editor, it creates a separate version in the Workshop, which isn't what I want.
If I upload from the Campaign selection screen, it doesn't seem to update what's in the Workshop.

Wait do you mean public testing?
Yeah.  My install of VTOL VR was the public testing version and I created the Campaign in that version.  Then I reverted to the stable version and tried to update the Campaign.
oh yeah i highly suggest you don't do that because there is no frame rate limit for me so it just maxes out my GPU and CPU and i get like 1132+ fps.

No

what does 'getting take off path async mean'?
sorry didn't mean to paste/post all this detail
Where did you place the bomber.

Does 9 have a path?
no. log seems to indicate  inbuilt path being used - 'AirbaseNavTaxiRoutine' just to complete description bombers are not spawned on apron, they're spawned on a taxi way and have separate event at start up to taxi to apron - this occurs OK. later another event triggers take off. I previously had taxi paths for bombers to take them onto runway with subsequent event to takeoff - same thing happened - didn't take off. I didn't check log previously to see what was happening.
So have you set the bombers as take off on default

how can i set a waypoint or path with my carriers? Image
You’ve not posted an image, so I’m going to use my imagination
Once you’ve created the path, the most reliable way to get units to file it is to create a Timed Event that Starts Immediately with an action for the unit/unit group to move to waypoint or follow path

how do you make an entire group do something?
I have a sea group that I want to move in circles
I'd probably use an event trigger sequence and add a ton of nodes that tell the ship group to go to the next waypoint in a circle of waypoints. the entry and exit conditions between actions being their proximity to the waypoints, and the event actions having the group always navigate to the next waypoint in the circle. do that over an over again until they circle as long as you need them to.

Question, I've made a path for this bomber to follow (For a mission where you're supposed to take down the bomber before they land), and don't see a way to get them to land from the path tools?
Or really, slow down or anything?
You need to use events to make them land. They will contact air traffic control to request landing. If there are unoccupied parking spots, they will be allowed to land and park.

Put a waypoint along the path at a reasonable distance from the airfield, then set up a triggered event, on the bomber’s proximity to the waypoint to give it the land action

How do I make a mission available to all planes?
You don't
there's a mod that lets you do that as a player but iirc you can't create multi plane missions

ah! okay. How do I *change* the plane that the mission is for tho?
I couldnt figure that out lol
Scenario Options or similar, in one of the menus at the top

What happened when you tried?
click "Edit" at the top then "Scenario info"
i think

You running stable or public testing?
stable
Gimmie 15m to roll back to that then, and I'll have a look

@ZacFluff Works for me. Are you still having issues after validating?
I will be unable to check until tonight. currently at work 😛
I will try again and report after work

So along these lines, if I were to make a Campaign for the A10 Mod, is there a way to override the vehicle that is locked to the mission?

So along these lines, if I were to make a Campaign for the A10 Mod, is there a way to override the vehicle that is locked to the mission?
you would make an F/A-26B mission
^

Yeah, and then the player could override with the Mod menu when they are ready to start the Campaign?
yeah if you load a plane it pops up in the vehicle select for scenarios in the editor.
I'm struggling to get MBTs to follow a path over a bridge.  Is there a secret to this?

Several of them will drop into the water below.
Ground units are completely free of path finding. The group leader will follow the path, and the rest will form up in formation around them

Regarding a ground unit being "detected": what does that mean and what are the mechanics for it?
is it shown on the navigation map
if its always discovered, you can always see it on the nav map, otherwise you have to get close enough or lock it to "discover" it

Can I begin an Objective, complete it, and then begin it again later?  This is via a triggered objective.  I might want to use the objective repeatedly in a mission.
Nope
Skumby - I've seen meanjeans' question multiple times. I can understand why you might not want to repeat an objective (given conditions around objectives, prerequisites etc). But the same answer applies to events - why can't an event be reused/retriggered, IE if there's something that allows event to be made active again. Things like trigger conditions can simply re-occur and the actions re-actioned if possible (same as when event is first triggered).   I guess I'm asking is there technical / Unity issue that prevents this or is it just Baha hasn't coded that way?  Just curious!

No technical reason. It's just the way it works currently
Having events and things repeating makes things more complicated than they need to be for the vast majority of situations

Ta! Doesn't seem more complicated to me (I'm a novice Unity user).  Simply 're-enable' event (ie make it available again), and if trigger conditions re-occur,  just redo actions. What am I missing?
The edge cases
The complications needed for the UI to make it usable

I’m trying to fix an issue with Op Restore (AV42-C). The blue infantry will not board Player’s AV42-C so objective will not complete. Player’s AV42-C was somehow removed from BoardableAircraftFilter. Any one had this issue or have a suggestion?
yeah sometimes that just happens I don't know why but I think it might be something to do with the path finding.
Thanks. I’ll revisit the path to see what I can change.

Are you giving the infantry any other actions to perform, even if you think it can't possibly trigger?

you have to put the player on the carrier manually through the carrier selection.

Oh I see
click on one

Can I have that play asset in some random spot on the map and as long as his spawn is set to the AC were good?
yes
setting the carrier spawn moves the player spawn to the deck

Yes

Is anyone aware of any co-op cas missions that are out there that would suit 2-3 players in A10's ?
kill box might be good
Yeah i've played that one before, just wondering if there might be any others :Thonk:

does anybody know why my mic commands wont work in custom missions? they work in all the dev made carrier practices but whenever I try and use them ingame it never works.
in game meaning in a custom mission^^ im talking about like requesting landing at carriers and such, hate having to use the MFD
What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?

What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?
Request landing/takeoff and calling the ball. I read the wiki so I know you have to preface it by saying the name of the carrier but still, only works in dev made missions. never works in my own customs.
What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?

What command are you trying to use? What’s the name of the carrier/airfield?
"Aircraft Carrier Two, Requesting Landing"
Hull num is 2 name is Aircraft Carrier and its unit 0

is Aircraft Carrier Two the exact name?
or is it zero two?
I can double check but its just named Aircraft Carrier, the unit number assigned to it by the game is 0 and i changed the hull number to two

or is it zero two?
I can double check but its just named Aircraft Carrier, the unit number assigned to it by the game is 0 and i changed the hull number to two
you have to use the name of the airport

So try leaving off the two and just saying the rest?
Thank you btw

As far as official multiplayer goes, no one knows, as it’s not possible yet
^, I assumed MP mod then

Question, is there a way to force F45s to land with wires on the carrier vs them landing vertically? Don't think so but just curios if anybody's found a way
They’ll land conventionally if they’re fat

yeah if you both have the mods loaded
sick ty ty

Thinking about trying to make a mission for a friend and I to play together (using the Multiplayer mod), are there any limitations to what you can in a singleplayer mission compared to making a mission for the multiplayer mod?
yes
objectives can only be completed by the host, unless its something like "kill x" or maybe going to a waypoint

How do you make player spawns for people other than the host?
you can't
Then how do other people spawn in?

Then how do other people spawn in?

Is there a way to force enemy planes to maintain a speed until they've done a bombing run? The idea is that a bomber squadron appears to attack the player's carrier and they must intercept and destroy them before they reach the carrier. But they're flying super fast so it's hard to catch them
And can you make them fly in formation until they spot any hostiles?
If you create the flight path of the enemies to fly in formation, but keep the engage enemies box checked in their settings then they will break off and engage once they detect you on radar

And can you make them fly in formation until they spot any hostiles?
If you create the flight path of the enemies to fly in formation, but keep the engage enemies box checked in their settings then they will break off and engage once they detect you on radar
Unless they’re incapable of engaging you, like a bomber

Do I have to path each one individually or will they fly formation on one path?
If you have them in a unit group, and tell the unit group to follow the path, they’ll move in formation
Awesome, cheers guys

This guy won't attack the F45 on the carrier deck (5km right in front of it). Anyone know why?
Set a timed event that starts immediately and tells him to attack it and for the F45 to take off as well

Is the carrier allowed to attack enemies?
No, I want it to be kind of a cinematic start where a stray fighter kills the F45 onboard and then buzzes the carrier before retreating to it's base.  So I disable 'engage enemies' until 40s has passed

I would hope they'd not use the bombs, but that's a neat edgecase
laser bombs can still be dumb fired i think, possibly the AI will use them as unguided bombs

can you make av42s land on a crashed unit? Like if i shoot down an enemy unit, can I force the av42s to land where the crash site is? kinda hard to predict where ill shoot it down at

can you make av42s land on a crashed unit? Like if i shoot down an enemy unit, can I force the av42s to land where the crash site is? kinda hard to predict where ill shoot it down at
or id set them to land at waypoint
you can set a waypoint on a unit, then set up action for AV42 to land at that waypoint when unit is destroyed. (It might right on top of crashed plane). However, waypoint might not survive once the crashed unit 'disappears'. it might survive when unit is destroyed. Idk what will happen - never tried it.

Don’t know if I should put this in mods or not, but when I try and make a mission for the a10 wart hog mod I click on the a10 plane after I load the mod but it says I’m still using the av-42c. Am I actually using the a-10 or no?
Just set it to the fa-26b for modded planes
No

Where do I find my campagins in my vtol vr files? I see custom scenairos, editor resources, n stuff
wait
actually nvm found it

Geez @Skumby  why so caustic? I'm  not being malcious or trying to mislead,  was just trying to help. I never said "Land at Wpt" objective worked as I suggested. While you're pointing out a deep subtlety between waypoints (1) and (2), both defining fixed waypoints or setting waypoint fields in events and relevant objectives, both  lead to (2) NAV lines and HUD icons, so to flight experience seem to be the same thing.   But agree with you " there is no way to make a (1) waypoint (defined in editor) follow a unit. They’re fixed points set in the editor "
 The join objective says "If the objective does not have a waypoint set, it will automatically be set to the [Target Unit]." which what I think Yoboy was looking for - a way to put a 'waypoint' (type 2 to be sure) on a unit. Similarly why I showed screenshot of proximity event, where the 'waypoint' can be set to a unit. The screenshot I used (of Join objective) is from a mission I have. Once objective is triggered the waypoint icon appears in HUD and follows target unit, and NAV green line appears.  Which confirms what you said "Some objectives can have their (2) waypoint set to a (1) waypoint or a unit in the mission editor".
ok
@YoBoy further on my suggestion of setting (I hestiate to use word) waypoint to the unit that going to crash. I tried it, the waypoint continues to exist after the  AI plane is shot and is going down, but disappears once the unit hits the ground and is destroyed .... so is not a solution to your problem. Sorry if i mislead you.

Does av42 land and take off OK? Might be too heavy once troops are loaded - check TWR.  To drop troops you need to specify a rally waypoint near the landing site where they assemble once they dismount the aircraft.  Not had problems with pick up troops using 'board aircraft' event. got to specify in event which aircraft to board. I guess troops need to be near aircraft and selected aircraft is on the ground.
have specify which troops to pick up as well.
Screenshot your events

Unload troop command. Then remove waypoint then add a reset way point of path?

But

Are you referring to the sound of the gun firing after the rounds impact? Because if so the reason those are delayed is due to the speed of sound and because of that, the pilot would not hear staggered firing sounds
pilot doesn't hear that, the first sound you hear in videos taken from the ground are the rounds impacting, then the sound of the gun firing because the rounds are supersonic.
damn here i was thinking that was a reload noise of some sort

Hey um, when making a mission how do I 1. Make wingman that Vertically take off and follow you, and  2. Make other aircraft take off then follow a path?
Using timed events

Hey um, when making a mission how do I 1. Make wingman that Vertically take off and follow you, and  2. Make other aircraft take off then follow a path?
Using timed events
Stack up a Take Off with a Form Up On, or a Follow Path (actual action names may vary)

Do I need to give them a taxi path too?
Nope. They'll handle that themselves assuming they're in a vaguely sane position
When you tell the wingmen to take off, they will automatically choose vertical or conventional, depending on their load weight.

Alright, and if I wanted a group of like, 7 26's to take off, would I have to time each individually or would their AI know to taxi automatically, when set at a base?
They'd handle it automatically
Queuing up on the taxiway, waiting for their turn

And another question, any way to get a bunch of friendly aircraft upon take off to fly in a formation towards their target, or like, for an assault context would it be better if they just scrambled?
Could just have them fly to a waypoint to start with, then give them the attack action when they got closer
They'll automatically break and engage if they see something to kill, or something attacks them

Is there a way to spawn the same units twice?
what like copy them?
The same ones

@Dinner Plate just curious - why do they need to be same unit and not a copy? a new spawn could be made identical except internal mission editor unit number - from player's point of view it will look the same.
I was trying to see if it was possible to make an infinite scenario
If I can’t respawn the same exact unit then the mission cannot be infinite

well, then why not use that?
I wanted to see if it was possible to effectively create Hoggit Georgia at war, while Cheeses mod would make it infinite, it wouldn’t be dynamic
You can make it to be dynamic

i've set up a rearm/refuel point unit in a custom mission. but everytime I land on it and request rearm/refuel via comms, the voice response is request denied (in various phrases). I've got engine off and ARM is off too.   why don't work? Is there a trick to using these units (there are 4 varieties) ?
is there a bug with duping carriers that have stuff on them?
nvm about rearm/refuel point issue.  I worked it out. mission was a joy flight and so I didn't have  Equipment Configurable set in Scenario Info. So ground crew reseponse was correct - can't rearm/refuel (I only wanted fuel) if your plane is not configured for it. Was duh moment for me.

Hey, quick question about the mission editor. Say I got 4 AI planes in the same flight group and I want them to follow a path. Do I need to create a path for each or can I assign them all to one path and will they stay in formation? I am assuming it's the latter but I can't find any detailed info on this 🙂 Thanks!
You can use an event to give the unit group an action to follow the path
It's not something that the default behaviours can do

how can I change the player's vehicle?
im making my first mission
you change it in the mission info

Units have action 'Set Invincible' - can you later 'Reset Invincible' ie make them take damage? Can't see an action for that.
I just want to prolong the fight a bit
surely set invinciable has a true false argument? i haven't used it tho

surely set invinciable has a true false argument? i haven't used it tho
didn't think of that (and didn't look either). I set up dummy action and yes  ... that's how it works!  Set Invicible is the action and you set it ON (check box) or set it OFF (uncheck box). Thanks

well you assumed correct as it measure the radius

in some missions (eg in The Island) there's lot of radio chatter - pilots saying they're going after baddies, evading missiles, 'Fox Two', 'ejecting' etc, Is this generated by the AI air units, or must be set up with Radio Messages events/actions?  If done automatically by AI, is there some options on units required to be set?
Thats the AI wingmen telling you what they're doing
if they get shot down they"ll say theyre ejecting or if they shoot theyll say fox 3

thks Quiggles I'm not sure either - in the preloaded missions The Island (preloaded with VTOL VR install) you join up with unit group of 3 x 26B 's, they shoot the shit out of the baddies and talk about it (on raidio) but I don't think  you (as Player) join their group.   Anybody else have understanding about audio behaviour of AI air units?

seems like action only works for individual units, not unit groups!
if the ai aircraft are in the same group as you, they will call out by default

is there a way to change which aircraft a mission is using retroactively? just making a mission ahead of time for the helo and I was wondering if its a waste of time even trying ahead of time
yeah you can
hopefully this would work on the AH

is there a way to make pvp missions with objectives?
Not currently
How do I create a multiplayer mission in the public-testing version. I added a player spawn, I don't know how to set aircraft for teams.

can you in full release?
We don't know
make a multiplayer mission?

are there voices recorded for literally the entire phonetic alphabet btw?
I've flown as Whiskey 1-1 before
yup

subtitling, why? I dont know
custom voice lines mod could be neat actually. anyway sorry for offtopic
i litterally did this for every single comm type already (except ground)

Could we also get new features for the basic editor? I find it useful if specific data from a unit can be read, like it's altitude, it's attitude, it's speed, etc.
or at least see who's talking
can we move this to like #vtolvrdev

I think those are only on completion, right?
Yes
Money being pooled with the team vs per player as an option would be nice

Can you turn it off in sp too?
turn off...?
unit icons

is that not a thing we do IRL?
I have a whole set of mp mod missions if you wanna slap those in

can't argue with that

Have you ever had a use for Global Values?
Because I can't say I have
i swear you never need to use it unless its really complicated

Also can you set a global variable to be equal to like, the amount of units currently in mission?
I haven't played with global variables that much
global variables can only be messed with directly

Also, in the naval strike wen interceptors are sent out every like 5 minutes, did he just spam place the units or is there a better way?
He spam placed units

Off topic. Did baha ever add black smoke flares?
I don't think so
Ahhh whyyy.  Need more smoke effects!!

what units would you want?
Also we need crashed f/a and 45 static objects

I do like the map editor, and I want to create stuff, I just have no idea what I want to make.  How do you guys typically find inspiration?
Multi plane spawners for continuous action. Waves of enemies every X number of minutes
Maybe it already exists, but circular logic that lets you return to previous objectives could be interesting. You could make objective-based tug-of-war pvp missions.

It could be added in later, right?
Possibly
Likely

Being able to change aircraft mid-mission. Might seem weird, but say you spawn in a AH-94, clear out the defenses, then someone can respawn in a f-35 with a strike package. It honestly might be possible out of the box just by hitting respawn when you think you're ready to change aircraft - so maybe a triggered event that can enable new spawn slots? (That can then lead to large MP battles with spawn spots being enabled/disabled based on captured bases, etc.)
Is there still no unit spawner in the mission editor? 😦
> Hi is their a way to have random selection so in other words have say 3 enemy fights all 3 are taken off spawn immediately and so that when the player enters and area that 1 of the 3 will spawn but randomly so different each time they played so it spawn the same all the time  Someone emailed me asking this. Does anyone know if its possible?

@. Marsh.Mello . So you want one of the three to spawn each time, but a random one?

@. Marsh.Mello . So you want one of the three to spawn each time, but a random one?
I took it as they had three possible spawns and wanted one of them to randomly be picked.
maybe he could use a trigger event using the chance % for spawning in the units

@Skumby I tired the alt spawn but couldn’t get it to work, do you have to change or add something in the alt spawn? And do you need a conditional % for unit to spawn?  With chance even with 2 enemy’s and 50% sometimes you get nothing spawning could you give more pics if you get it to work thanks
How do you edit the briefing slides in a custom mission. I can find the description and mission image but not the spot for the briefing
you should find it all in the edit tab

Is there a way to hide all the UI within the editor?
i don't think so
Ah dang

How Does the alt spawn percentage work ? So with spawn 1 that is their at the start it is set at 100, but I cannot change it , then if I set spawn 2 to say 50 and spawn 3 to 50 how does it work with spawn 1 at 100
those are weights. 100 is just an arbitrary standard.  if all alt spawns are 100, then they all have an equal chance of being selected. if 2 and 3 are 50, then there's a 50% chance spawn 1 will be selected, and a 25% chance for spawn 2, etc
Re creating missions using the helicopter - I don't have helicopter (yet) and when create mission in mission editor - helipcopter not available in Scenario info. Also there's no helicopter AI either. IDK if this changes when have DLC helicopter.

Is there a way to keep placing the same static object in the mission editor?
Copy it
Kinda annoying to have to go back into the menu

I don't see a Copy button anywhere? Is it supposed to be next to Move, Delete, ...?
Guess there's not a copy button then

Ok

When we get custom mission support for mp, how will skins work? Will there be like an option for the unit on what skin they have or something else?
When using the alt spawn, if I sync the group, it will add the spawns to the other members, which makes sense. However, it doesn't copy the other units' spawn options over to the new ones. I know I can work around it by defining them separately first, but I feel like this is an unintentional behavior.
Workshop support for skins would actually be cool.

Is there a hotkey for the move command or do I have to click it every time?
Awesome Thankyou
Im trying to set up a unit group to spawn after 3 other objectives are done and I am having trouble setting up the action for it.

Anybody know how to change your players callsign? I know changing unit group but what if i wanted to be Echo 2-4 instead of 1-4? If that makes sense
sadly no way to do that
this is pain

Got a big an94 mission coming out tomorrow's.  Anyone wanna do voice work? Hmu if u want in
I wouldn't mind
I, uh, don't have a voice reel handy but I'm sure you've heard my voice as the AWACS on the F-45 co-op

I see.  So there could be more than one objective going at the same time?
I've always done them in sequence.
Yeah, you can have as many objectives active as you want

Cool. And remember, if you come across other weird stuff breaking, always ask yourself, "how can I use global values to fix this?"
Global values saved my marriage

Do you have to shut the engines down on the 42 for infantry to board?
Nope
just open the doors while being relatively parked

Shouldn't I see all 42's in the mission as an option?
Can infantry ONLY board AI 42s?
no

Can infantry ONLY board AI 42s?
no
what does that even mean

In other words, how would I get the infantry into my 42?
Do I have to use Pick Up and Drop Off objective types in order to have infantry board and dismount?
Hey folks How would one go about scripting/modifying an RCS test mission like this one? https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763453407 I'm hoping to test the detection range for various AH-94 loadouts And against AI planes as well, if possible

Searching around the discord and found your reply, Can elaborate on how you got the AI AV-42C to properly unload infantry? I have mine setup with infantry in seats and with a sequence to land, unload, and return to orbit waypoint but it gets as far as landing and then immediately taking off again, and also straight into the ground rip.

This. The board aircraft action is only for AI. You need to use objectives for them to board and deboard the player vehicle

All actions under an event are executed at the same time. So if you’ve got an event that lands, disembarks, and takes off, the AI plane is going to get super confused

Just so I understand right, all nodes in a sequence are executed all at once if no enter/exit conditions are set? That is currently my setup.
Yeah. If you don’t have any conditions or times, it’ll do the whole thing at once
Understood, that makes sense, Last question from me is what the exit condition should be for unload? To make the AV42 wait for full disembark. I don't  see anything like "is Empty". Fallback idea is a simple timer but I generally like to avoid dead reckoning if I don't have to.

I use a proximity trigger for the infantry on their rally point that’s activated once the ai plane has landed
I figured there would be a better way than a dead timer :) great idea thanks

Why could it be? It's a smallish PNG.
There’s a possibility is putting an error message in the player.log file
I still havent a single clue on how to use global values

can I start the editor without going into VR?
Yes
If you start without a VR HMD plugged in

Is it possible to create multiplayer missions yet?
Nope
we're still waiting on them

and I believe the modded MP doesnt work anymore, is that correct?
nope
unless you revert to an old version, but I don't see a reason to

Hello, i've been trying to get an AV-42C to load up, take off, fly a path, land at a waypoint and unload. but the AV-42C gets as far as completing the flight path but doesnt attempt to land and just flies off. Is there something that i am missing to get it to land at a waypoint?
You don’t have any energy or exit conditions, so it’s doing all the steps of the sequence at once
I just had this exact question as well recently in history, check out the above for some more insight :) https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/930300229381681162

Anyway to make it so the av-42c uses vtol when it’s an AI instead of automatically doing regular flight speed?

whats the best way to create a "wait" objective
like if i want the player to chill for like 1 min before giving the next objective

Doing some isolated AI experiments to learn about their behavior/functions... I have noticed that AI, when grouped, will stay with their group even when only one unit is given an instruction to move while the others are set to "parked" behavior. Is there any functional difference between this and using the UnitGroup Move Path? This then also asks the question what does the "follow" behavior do?
I think its kind of an escort for Plane
Groups used to automatically form up immediately even in park. Baha made a fix that they will stay in their original positiin until any move.. after which the group will form up.  I think follow is more there for following players.    Really no idea why group moves are a thing when any group unit causes the whole to move...

Hey.. question. How long does it take for MAD4 sites to deploy and what series of actions need to be ordered to transfer them from path to able to engage?
like 5, 10 seconds maybe?
"Stop" and "engage enemies" don't seem to do it. They stop and their radars go up, but no scanning.

that should be good enough

Trying to do some kind of IADS behaviour?
Eh, the point is you already destroyed the EW site and got a jump on them. I don't want it to be too hard.
👍

Can I launch the mission editor directly without going into VTOL VR or do I have to launch it from the VR menu then switch to pancake? 🙂
you can in pancake
I must be missing something 🤔

On that note, is there a launch param to skip right to mission or map editor? I noticed you don't need to keep steamVR running once you're in either. Can I skip the steamVR step?
yes
...and that is, please?

hey does anyone know how to upload missions to the workshop with custom audio included?
its that easy?
Yes

what do you not have you audio included?
BGM will save
And so will custom voice lines

i have no friends... can anyone tell me if the audio works in this? https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2717323816
well you can test it your self if you download it from the workshop
it's the same file.

Btw does anyone know when the ah-94 is coming to the mission editor?
AH-94 is already available in the editor
It was available when it launched

How do you "Set Disengage" after a "Set Engage" action?
LOL and a few more questions after that?
Well you could have classified that you meant AI helicopters because there has been no announcement on them other from “his working on it”

LOL and a few more questions after that?
Well you could have classified that you meant AI helicopters because there has been no announcement on them other from “his working on it”
I also meant “ability to fly custom helicopter missions” because it’s impossible to launch the ones from the steam workshop

Is you game on the right version?
Most recent update and I own the DLC. I can see them when I click on the workshop tab but there’s no option to launch them
I’ll try again today, haven’t had time since the weekend

Is there something broken with the mission editor when you go to launch your mission? I just started working with the mission editor today and it never loads my mission when I choose that option.  I have to completely restart the app and pick the mission from the custom missions manually.
Just tried it again and didn't have a problem this time.
I'm trying to do something that I think should be simple, I'm just trying to get some rocket artillery trucks to fire on a waypoint.  I've created a timed event, chosen "fire salvos on waypoint" after no delay.  I can tell the event is doing something, because the trucks "aim" at the waypoint, but no rockets are firing.    I've set the shots per salvo to 4, and the number of salvos as high as it will let me , 120.   I also set the reload time down really low, (5 seconds).  But I'm just not seeing any rockets launch.e

are you using allied or enemy bunkers? the enemy bunkers are destroyable but take a lot of damage
the allied bunkers seem more resilient than enemy bunkers but i have not tested it extensively
if you want to give more options to busting bunkers, you could place a soldier inside the bunker and make its death the trigger for the destruction of the bunker

could it be that the target is below a minimal range?
oh hey doombox, fancy seeing you here lol
Oh hi lol

So when you get into the vr headset does it just be a black screen for steam vr?
Or the app itself
Yeah it was a black screen and the monitor was stuck on a “darkened” version of what was on there before.

Are you using a link cable or no?
If you are using quest
No. RiftS.

how do you delete units in the editor?
Select them on the right, then click delete in the top right
ah! I'm so dumb. Was expecting to have such a button in the unit details panel. Or Del or Backspace keys to work.

wait alot of mission don't do that?
wait oh for mp
None of the MP missions do that.

I’m guessing there’s no way to right click and drag a box thing to select multiple units?
well you can use groups
True

Is there an easy way to update a map already on the workshop?
Just put it on the Workshop again
There isn't any more detailed docs than what's in the Wiki for the Mission Editor, is there?  I'm starting to make progress with my custom mission and running into some confusion over how units following paths should work, but the docs i've found are kind of lacking so i'm not sure how to make them do what I want them to do.

Mystery solved

I'm working on a mission where I want to have a "don't go there" zone.  And I'm looking for teh most effective way of killing the player (without just killing the player with an event)  In other words, how can I launch a whole boat load of missles at the player if they go into a forbidden area?     My initial attempts at this (multiple SAMs) in the area, etc, just isn't producing the "volume" of agression that I'm looking for.  Any advice?
you could use an event where if the player goes near a waypoint or unit the unit could engage the player.
that's basically what i'm trying, but I don't see the action to engage the player...

set engage enemies just toggles the engage enemies checkbox on the unit, right?  Which I already have checked.    I did get it to fire missles, but I'm looking for a very agressive, they all fire at once kind of thing, but it seems like when you tell the AI to engage it's smart about not wasting all it's ammo at once...
Thanks for your attention, by the way @Red Elite
sadly units can't use there entire arsenal at once.

but what's with the problem?
Only problem is I still need to figure out what I was just doing wrong with the SAMS just now  I was just testing with a single RADAR and SAM (hooked up to the RADAR), but it wasn't firing.
I got one to fire yesterday, but for now, the IRPACs will be good for my prototype.

is it set to engaged?
Yeah the units were set to engage enemies.
is the equip set to none?

is the equip set to none?
No, it was equipped with the FLKM-100
wierd

What is the difference between Path and Rail Path Unit Behavior?
There is no difference now
Before there was, but regular path was buggy so I made it just do the same behavior as rail path, but kept the old option to let old missions not break

Yeah I noticed that too.  Do ground units follow the path more precisely , is that how you get them to drive along roads?
Question about Proximity trigger, the checkbox for "Spherical radius" when unchecking that, does that imply **cylindrical ** radius instead of spherical?
yes

Like on the aircraft
they'd have to sit outside on the wings

Either way though, are there any decent tutorials out there?
Although a nice compromise would be escorting another vehicle carrying troops. Just like the idea of some logistical missions to practice flying the heli

I am wondering if this Timed event will do what I'm expecting:   Here is what I'm hoping to accomplish,   I want the same unit (golf-rocket-1) to fire 1, 2 shot salvo at 3 different waypoints in sequence.     Are the actions inside of an event run in sequence?  Or is having 3 actions for the same unit in the same Event within an Event group going to do something weird, like only execute the last action?
ignore the "22" typo in shots per salvo for the second action...
is it activated by anything?

is it activated by anything?
Yes, It will be activated by another trigger, right now I'm testing by checking that box
Which brings me to another question... Anybody have any good tricks for testing without the headset...   I've Figured how how to go into debug mode (Ins).  But is there some setting I can apply to the player (Heli) so that it just hovers in one spot while I watch my event logic unfold?

you can always use the autopilot
I'm not sure what you mean by that, I looked for actions I could apply to the player, like "enable autopilot, hover, etc" but all I see is this.

Uhhh, what just happened here? (Video) Camera broke when I was adding an objective briefing 😮

Ha! I must have! Is that a feature? What does it do?
funny enough we were just talking about that. @_provector

For the enemy bombers why is it that when you set them bombing location and have the right altitude.. why do they suddenly start dive bombing or just diving and they never drop their bombs?
Hmmm Tried to do a sequence event to get what I'm looking for and it is not working as expected. Notice that there are two Nodes, each with 3 actions.  What I'm expecting is that all the actions in the first node Will Occur at the same time, and then all the actions in the second node will occur.  But what is actually happening is that the last node is happening.  It's as if there really is no sequence to the sequence event, or the sequence is "give this asynchronous order" and move on to the next.   How can I stop a sequence event from progressing from one node to another until the Actions in that node are done executing?  I know I could try to hack it by adding in delays, but that defeats the point of using a sequence for me, since I don't know how long the actions are going to take, I'd have to tiral and error them.
I looked at entry and exit conditions, hoping that maybe I could put a "if unit is idle" entry or exit condition so that it only moves on once the units are done executing their orders, but I don't see anything like that.

Also anyone know the max range on enemy rocket artillery truck?
I think the wiki says 32km for that
So it can reach 24km..?

So it can reach 24km..?
Wait here I’ll check thank you!
there are no conditions for after a action is completed, you can only make a condition for the results of an action i.e. killing a target/group or getting in a position. if you're just shooting a waypoint you can place a dummy target which destruction triggers the next sequence or do it with timers as you said. also consult the https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor/Events for information about conditions and events.

Thanks @Mr_Crusoe , Ive definitely got that page open in my browser as I'm working on this.  For now I can use the delay between nodes approach, which is working OK, but not ideal.  Your suggestion of using a dummy target brings me to my next little stumbling block.  I've got the sequence running with the delays and now I want to be able to repeat the sequence.  I tried Begin(ing) the Event I'm already in to start it up again, but that didn't work.  So I tried Begin(ing) a different event that just begins my main event again and that didn't work either.  So now it makes me wonder whether any event types (timed trigger or sequence) are repeatable?  I don't see that limitation mentioned in the Wiki, but it would seem to me so far that I can't run an event more than once (from my experimentation)
Nothing is repeatable
I think it could be cool to have something where you have to use the A2G radar on the Heli without the eots

But theres no way to force turn it off right?
Issue is to employ weapons you still need the TADS (or I guess you can use GPS weapons)

Does anybody know what type of serialization the mission .vts file is in?   I can get around the "nothing is repeatable" issue I have with events by creating more complex events, but doing so with the GUI will not be fun, but it would be easy for me to edit the .vts file directly... Even easier if I could do it with some code.    I don't recognize the format at first glance but it looks like a cleaner version of JSON (no quotes).
Would'nt be suprised if it uses the custom format baha made

Yeah it is

Do you say that by just looking at it, or do you know for certain that the format being used is custom.  I ask, because even though we don't recognize it as a very common one (JSON, YAML, etc) it might still be something common with the toolchain that is used to develop the game?
Im fairly confident, iv used quite a few formats and never seen this, and looking at the game code I *think* its fully custom
Ok yeah it is custom

Educate me on this... Is the code for VTOLVR open?  Or do you have access to
im writing a vts2json just for the fun of it
No and no, but you can decompile the code and take a peak

What is it developed in?
All method names retain their original names, and the decompiler is quite good about guessing names to things
Unity/C#/mono

found some rando parser maybe? https://github.com/taniwha/cfgnode
But the config node class thats in vtol seems to be not as an external project
Yeah, maybe custom built by the KSP devs and then "borrowed" by BD?

@BahamutoD Any info about the VTS file format/how we could possible parse it and work with it?

@BahamutoD Any info about the VTS file format/how we could possible parse it and work with it?
Well, that worked like a charm.  Since I can't repeat the event, I just opened up the VTS and edited it by hand to "unroll the loop" and run my sequence 3 times instead of just once.  Worked nicely.  That will work for me for now.
Is there some sort of official place to make feature requests for the game and mission editor?  Being able to repeat an event, or have a sort of rudimentary "goto" capabilities within an event to allow for some repetition would be really nice.  But I suspect that the engine needs to support that sort of thing before you could add anything to the editor.

are you asking about adding c# to it

Cities Skylines to .vts export wen?
@Red Elite nice detail there!  and as far as "amateur" i'd say "beginner" is more appropriate....
the maps in C:S are 18x18 km, they're incredibly small

Is anybody old enough to remember Sim Copter and how you could import SimCity (2k?) cities into it?
I would LOVE to be able to fly around in Cities Skylines maps...
uhh.  you understand there is no x shape building in the map editor

Anyone know max range on MPA-155?
~~their file format is more proprietary than actual Paradox content lol, good luck exporting them~~
the game was pretty shallow... a lot of "pick up this person", "hose down this building that's on fire" stuff. but was still fun.

Anyone have a topdown image of the vanilla campaign island? Or know how I can source it from files?
akutan?
Yup that's the one

nice... but shouldn't that be in #map_editor?
Oh whoops, thought I was in there 😄
anyway nice map

wouldn't it just be easier just to open it in notepad?
it is on the right
But, now I can translate VTS to JSON

Thinking about doing a mission where you either first scout out targets and mark GPS coordinates of stationary threats (airbases, FOBs, SAMs, etc) and then RTB and attack them from high speed and altitude. *Or,* you are assigned a scout taking and wingmen (/other players eventually) will attack. Is it possible to use GPS markers in missions this way for use in forwarding the mission? Like a specific marking, not simply just *target->is locked in TECAS/TGP/EOTS*
My thinking is realistically you only might know an area of movement of the enemy, not specific targeting locations
uhhh is dev talking about something else?

uhhh is dev talking about something else?
Yes red   want to give the AH a use in scouting as well, not just attacking but forward assistance and tactical aid
oh i though i was going crazy due to the time

can you change the detection mode in the editor events?
because i cant se it
I’m still unclear what that really does

“Is a target point set? Sent? Ok good we will hit it.”
It’s up to the players coordinates to be good if they want a kill or not
Buddy lazing would also be nice one day

Are they marked force undetected?
how the fuck do you know there is a road block in my mission
Not yours

is it possible to play custom missions with friends?
not yet
What are the options for sharing a mission with someone to betatest?  I assume if I uplaod to steam workshop it's publicly accesible?  Or can I set it to friends only?  I'm getting close to having something worth sharing with a select few people to help me play test the mission, but I don't want to put on the steamworshop until I work out some kinks with it and record some real radio audio.

so, i made a mission for MP that had 88 MAD 4 units in total.      There will be more, run
how does 208 sound

Hey, ive been playing around with editor too, however it seems to just be for single player missions, how do i change to multiplayer and add the appropriate spawns?
mp missions have just released today in the public testing branch, expect nothing to work lol
Still too many

Out of curiosity, is there a way to force or restrict players to only one team? (I want to make PVE scenarios)  I would like to avoid the trouble of having players join by mistake the other side, since absolutely no considerations will be made for team B as team A is considered the default for PvE scenarios
Obviously i don't expect things (and features) to work yet, but i'd like to stress test things a bit and setup the foundations of the missions so to speak
I'm not sure I understand how the new mission editor for MP is supposed to work? We can still only spawn 1 player spawn and I am seeing 0 changes on the UI to help us place spawns or change their team

I've checked the wiki to no avail.

I'm not aware of any such thing

is there an issue with the editor button on flat screen?
it launches VR and switches audio devices
Which is a minor inconvenience, but someone mentioned a shortcut parameter a few days ago. If it's not a thing, that's fine.

anyone else having a problem with mission not loading in the editor?
been here for like five minutes
The log'll likely have some errors in it

Is the 8 per team likely to change at all?
is there any way to respawn units apart from spamming copy/paste?
I hope not as that would be a lot of traffic to one computer

16 players factored in at the moment. If I can put all 16 on one side for a PVE mission I'll be happy.

Can you explain that further please? I know what the UI is but curious to see what the limitation might be.
inb4 the briefing room just isn't big enough 😄
There's no scroll bars

Can you launch a MP mission from the inside editor?
Nope
Mp isn’t in the editor yet

I may be just missing the obvious, how do you enable rearm on a carrier?
you don't?
should it be automatic? Was just watching a mission tester land on the carrier and get "rearm not available", Landed on the elevator.

should it be automatic? Was just watching a mission tester land on the carrier and get "rearm not available", Landed on the elevator.
Engine off?
It worked for me by just plonking a carrier down

Not sure. from the vanilla missions it would prompt you to turn your engines(or weapons) off, right? instead of the straight "rearm not available" text. But yeah sounds like it should just already be available, thanks, I'll play around with it.
:catshrug:
if it's for an mp mission, it could be possible that you have to go to your spawn to rearm

Alright I'm done converting one of my weird mission to MP, with kind of a complex logic, no issue so far as host. **The biggest grip is steam workshop not updating fast enough when you upload a version up**. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2723033273&searchtext=

Hey I am trying to play a bmg but when I pick the clip it wont play, I checked the clip itself and it works fine
Also whenever I try and choose bgm it wont let me save the game for some reason. It makes me "Save game as new copy" or something

Define "works fine". Is it a mono or stereo audio file?
As in when I open it up in my files it plays fine. When I add it to the bmg it dosent play
Probably an issue with it being a mono file, then

So its the file thats the problem?
Just tested every other file I had and those dont work either
Open it up in a program like Audacity, if it looks like the top file then it's mono, if it looks like the bottom one then it's stereo

How is the 94's free flight map called?

Internally, what is the map called

needed quick updates from baha for some features

I am not sure then, @BahamutoD while you're here do you have any ideas? They are trying to play an audio track as BGM but it refuses to load (and I think messes up saving?)
They can play it as a music track though
What is the audio file?

What is the audio file?
Well I can play any audio clip thru radio but literally nothing works thru bmg

To get your player.log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows Key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log". 4. Upload this file into #public_testing, or whatever channel you are asked to do so in.

Is there a way to show players how much Global Value is left? I want it to appear on the objective MFD page. But if it cannot, I want it to show on system message.
You could print it every time a trigger condition is true

Is there a way to show players how much Global Value is left? I want it to appear on the objective MFD page. But if it cannot, I want it to show on system message.
You could print it every time a trigger condition is true
so for every value it can be:

Question.. what even is global value and how do you use it?
It is an arbitrary value that can be used to do literally anything you want
An event can increment or decrement it's value

How do you use them?
Wait do you have to know how to code?
Nope

Wait do you have to know how to code?
Nope
you just need to know conditions

thing a complete? increment or change value x
value x =/>/< y? trigger event b
perhaps you want to keep track of the number of objectives a player has completed

value x =/>/< y? trigger event b
perhaps you want to keep track of the number of objectives a player has completed
with each one, you increment a value by 1, thus keeping a count that can trigger other events or objectives

Through a redbull-fueled rampage and the help of you guys here in discord I created my first 3 missions involving the helicopter DLC over the last 14 hours non stop. Much thanks to my friends for actively testing (and still currently testing) as I developed. If anyone would like to help test that would be greatly appreciated, The third missions has yet to be tested, but the other two have been and are confirmed in a playable and apparently enjoyable(tm) state. I intend to improve these over time (better briefings, robust edge case logic, balance) but the baseline missions are done. Thanks again! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2722787658
What a champ.
hey guys. i asked in the steam forum if its possible to crteate a mp mission in the editor. they said in the public testing it is possible. so i went into that but i cant place more then one player spawn. is it rly possible to create a multiplayer mission and if so, what am i doing wrong there? 😄

You need to start it as a multiplayer mission
A mission can't be both single and multi

how do i start a mission in the editor for multiplayer? i havent seen a button or anything for that 😄
You need to create a campaign
There's a Multiplayer tickbox next to the aircraft selection button

so its not working in the standalone mission tab? that explains why i havnt seen that 😄
Does that mean we can only have one aircraft type for mp missions
No. It means you can't select aircraft type if the campaign is multiplayer

how can i trigger a mission complete thing for a mp mission?
I assume it works the same way as it does for single player missions. Complete the last active objective
ah allright 🙂

Is it possible to open existing non-user made mission in editor? I am curious about AH-94 "Surprise Attack" mission...
No
k

You making a single player mission?
If you're making an MP campaign, the launch button is non functional.
Because launching multiplayer missions from the editor doesn’t work

MP Mission Editor - is there a way to embark infantry onto a player VTOL that I'm missing at all please?
like form up?
or engage

Is that SP Mission Editor or MP?
yeah that might be a bug for mp then
That's fine 🙂

Is there a way to spawn units in the game or do I just have to have all the units placed but like, deactivated?
yeah turn spawn immediately off
Oh but I still have to have the unit in the game already? I can't dynamically spawn units?

Oh but I still have to have the unit in the game already? I can't dynamically spawn units?
then you spawn it using an action
correct

Do all helipads have a rearm function or do I have to add that somehow?
i think a rearming point is a unit? i cant remember
There is a Ground Support object  called "Rearm Refuel A / B / C/ D"

Can I not add funds to the player in a mission?
I did a sample objective which rewarded funds and it only rewarded part of it and only after I left the mission
I've created a very simple practice mission in a multiplayer coop campaign: * 2 x F/A-26B (player spawn) * 2 x AV-42C (player spawn) * 6 x Enemy Tank To try it out, do I have to upload it? (I believe "Launch Scenario" doesn't work for multiplayer yet). Thanks

The mission might not work, so I feel a bit bad about uploading it...

@Vampaca I saw your comment on my campaign and I'm sorry to hear that you had trouble. Would you be willing to help me test the missions at a later time, perhaps this weekend, for the new updates? I haven't updated them in almost a year and a half but I have recently realized I still have all the required files.
Is there a way to place more player spawns for a coop mission? or is there another way you place the spawns/etc?
You can only create an MP mission by creating an MP campaign, once you do this you should be able to place multiple MP spawns

Thats very helpful, I was in the standalone mission editor, Thanks!

How do you make a multiplayer campaign?
Mission editor > campaign > check the little box that says “mp” or “multiplayer” I forgot what it says exactly
ahh i figured it out, wasnt on the public testing build, thanks again!

Were you able to solve this issue?
lol spoilers
:blobaww:

Is there an allied ground unit that can swim? 🤔 thinking of an amphibious landing...
No 😦 I wanted mobile radar, but it seems broken. Actually their is a dirty work around, make them start in Engage : True, and order them individually (not the group) on start to Engage false and follow a path , the mad radar will stay deployed, but it will move. Then when you want re enable the Engage enemies on each unit.
Nice finding. Definitely seems bugged. In my tests if engage enemies was not checked in editor before mission start, It would simply never deploy in missions under any circumstance. Even with just a simple timer event without moving.   Do you know if the radar still function and ping the player while it's moving with that work around?

Yes  the radar is active  when up when the mad-4 radar move and ping you.
It really hope it get fixed

Or you can exploit the bug to have mobile radars giving info the SAM ?
Actually it be nice to have a Stop to Engage option on them, similar to tanks
Thats pretty mucj what I was trying to do when I discovered this bug lol. A MADs patrol group that would sort of stop to engage but otherwise was on a constant loop

Does a sequence simply not run more than once?
the alt spawn is only for individual unit too 😦 it be sweet for group
All events can only occur once

what does sync does tho, it spawn the whole group on the same spawn pos?
or it keep their position relative in the formation?
No

or it keep their position relative in the formation?
No
😛

What's the setup for the other members of the group?
sync group too
When you tick the box on the group leader, it creates an Alt Spawn entry for each member of the group for each alt spawn for the leader. You then need to assign each of those alt spawn entries a location

On a semi-related noob note. If I have 8x infantry dudes, and they are all in the same group, will they move in a formation by default/behave as a unit at all?
It'll be difficult to get them to NOT move in a unit
They'll move in whatever formation you tell them to

Thank you, is there a place to set that group formation behaviour?
Use an event
Think it's on the Unit Group

if i read properly, each alternate spawn has its own move order behavior ?
I don't bother with the default behaviours, so not a clue
let me try quick

Unless there is way to know on which alt spawn the group has spawned  to send the proper event?
Proximity events would be how I'd do it
and there is no triggered by Unitgroup 😦

Do funds earned from objectives only get added after the mission is finished?
dumb question, is there anything specific I need to do in order to flag a mission as multiplayer compatible? I have alternate spawns for the 'player' unit but idk if i'm supposed to do other stuff
MP mission must be in a new campaign that is checkboxed as multiplayer when initially created. MP spawn positions are their own type of unit. You must be on the public_testing branch currently to create a MP campaign. Note that you currently cannot make individual scenarios MP and it must be a campaign.

do you know where the default missions and campaigns are saved?
They’re not openable or editable
ah alright

I’m going to try and make a COD mission for the AV-42, is it possible to have cargo in a mission in some form or just passengers ?
Someone else may have a better idea, but my solution to that would be using a global variable for "cargo loaded" and use waypoint triggers/timers to "load the cargo" at pickup location and "unload the cargo" at dropoff location.
That sounds good enough to model it

Heyo! Any way to get passengers to hop into multiplayer aircraft?
hey guys. is there a way to trigger the spawning of enemy aircrafts with the comms tab? so i have to get into comms in the MFD and then i can spawn them?

using conditional

ah so when i turn on the strobe lights for example i can spawn them?
yup
ty 🙂

how do I remedy this?
what is the unit?
all of them

how do I place  a player spawn point?
sorry this is my first time using this, im just trying to build a mission so I can practice dodging missles because im struggling with that xD
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2189296631 this could help

Anyone know if it's possible to set wether respawns are allowed in multiplayer?

you got multiplayer stat tho, so you could force finish the mission when too many player died

Anybody know if there is a way for steam workshop to force sync faster? (other than unsub/sub)

Question about multiplayer campaign editor (on public_testing branch) Is there a difference to "upload to steam workshop" in campaign overview or mission editor? From campaign, would it upload all the missions? Thanks
it should still upload all the missions and it would be uploaded under multiplayer campaigns
Thank you. I added a briefing image and the objective waypoint to the mission, but neither of them showed up. Do the subscribed campaigns/missions automatically update themselves? I couldn't see a way to check for any updates.

If you want to update a mission you just have to press the upload button again and it should automatically update it
Steam workshop is kind of slow. you better unsub/ resub your campaign every change :/

Does anyone know if funds rewards only matter after a mission?
Iirc they can be granted for completing objectives
I have them but it seems to only matter to campaigns. Like you only get them after the mission is completed

Off the cuff curious, other than funds, is there a system for structuring munition or fuel availability?
I have a great idea but I need to be able to reward funds in the same mission
MP coop campaign (public_testing) "Easy Missions"
 1st mission "Destroy the Tanks" works fine.  2nd mission "Intercept the Patrol" doesn't work as intended: * I was unable to make enemy planes start in the air * I created an enemy carrier and put 2 planes on the deck (with an orbit waypoint) but they didn't take off.  I'll see if I can fix it later today. I'll try setting the planes to "take off" (they are currently set to "orbit").

What did you set the airspawns to?
I've set their default behaviour to TakeOff. They have an orbit waypoint. Hopefully they'll fly there after taking off.
Not sure what you mean by "airspawns". I'll have a look when I'm next in the editor.

When selecting the mission... I see the mission image, but to the right is an "image missing". I see other missions sometimes have an image there (a terrain map?), but I can't see a way of adding an image there.
There is campaign image, Mission image, Briefing note image, if that help
Thank you. I've set images for all of them - campaign, mission and briefing (I'm using the same image for mission and briefing). There's still an "image missing" to the right of the mission image. I'll have another look after work to see if I've missed anything. I'm on public_testing. Campaign is "Easy Missions".

its a multiplier mission too, you are sure to have lastest workshop version of it?
what you mean latest workshop version? its my own i created 😄 everytime i upload it to test it, i get the newest 😄
you get it from the workshop manually?

Yesterday I found that uploading the *campaign* didn't update the missions (after a de-sub and re-sub too). Uploading the *mission* seemed to work. However, it could be that I hadn't allowed enough time for the *campaign* uploading to register.

So did you upload it on public testing?
Yes
Weird

Hey guys, i'm trying to make an online mission for the steam workshop and im trying to launch the scenario but it says im missing spawn points even if i have multiple. Any suggestions?
you cant launch a mp mission sadly
you have to upload it and play it through mp

is there an way to make a single player mission into an mp campagin?
well.....
well you could add this to the campaign file but thats a guess

quick question: If you set a trigger event to be enabled and conditional, can it only trigger once, or will it always trigger so long as it hasn't been deactivated and the conditions are met?
well i don't actually know but i think you can create loops as i accidently created a loop and after the game started my game crashed
Rip

you guys think this is enough air defense?
Your RWR is going to sound like an orchestra
Anyways I got this carrier in an MP public testing mission, with default behavior being navigate path, that path being the yellow line running under the carrier. However, for some reason the carrier refuses to move

is there anyway to make an AI AV42 or F45 hover in a mission?  The Nav Speed action seems to have floor setting  60m/s
No
there's a "CONVERT TO MP" button in the campaign edit window

Are you within 25m of the objective when you come to a halt?
yes
I'd jack it up to at least 200m to be sure

btw, is there a way to copy an entire mission to make the same mission again but with little tweaks?
Just copy the file/folder, if you're careful
You want to not copy the workshop info, so that it won't overwrite the other copy of it on the workshop

Missionathon? Lol that's pretty much what I did for Misc-Missions the day we got public testing MP. Thatd be a fun thing to try with a few people with a start to finish time and then play

How many aircraft can the assault carrier hold? Dosent say on wiki
6
Thank you!

Hi, anyone know the range (and conditions) at which infantry will shoot at each other?
I'm sure I had this working on previous MP missions (infantry were shooting at each other).
Now it seems to just be the tanks.

did their visual range change?
Maybe?
mk1 eyeballs

They can at least see armor, are you sure they won't *try* to shoot it?
hmm
they will attack then

it will not engage tanks with its gun?
Yeah it wont
Which seems almost like a bug...?

Which seems almost like a bug...?
SRAD gunner with his testicles of steel like... eh, it wont pen, guess i'll take the hit
:risitas:

Here's a question: is LOS blocked by buildings? (for ground units)
Does anyone know where I can find the smoke effect object thing in the mission editor
System -> System -> Light Flare

How do you make an AWACS for Team B?
good question, they have one in Naval Strike coop mission
and the F-45 one as well

maybe the unit isnt avaible yet in the mission editor?
But thats kinda hard when I cant place a AWACS for Team B
I guess

the unit is here, maybe it was left out of the selector by accident?
baha pls
pls baha

Also, why are the External 120s in the 45 not the 120Ds?
I thought that was fixed :thonkery:
Atleast in the editor its the normal 120

I'm new to using the mission editor.  I noticed that some of you are experimenting with MP missions in the public_testing branch.    I'm trying to decide if I want to play around with that now, or wait for it to go GA.    So I'm just curious as to how long things usually sit in public testing before they get released?
like a couple of months or less
Baha has mentioned planning on making the PT -> Stable cycle quicker

Did they remove the drone launching cruiser?
no
What about in public testing?

What about in public testing?
no
weird

When you add 3 radio messages like this will they que up from the top or play all at the same time?
They will queue
If you choose priority radio message, it will interrupt the previous message instead of queuing

So it wil start from the top down?
Yes
Thank you!

Rocket artillery are not firing. Target waypoint area is about 750m away. Could this be too low? Or could buildings be obstructing a clear shot? Thanks.
It's likely the arty's driver cab is blocking the shot
Try rotating them so they fire sideways

Interesting... The rocket artillery are now about 3km behind the front lines. They are each placed on top of a hill. Their rockets are landing way too far behind the waypoint target area (about 3km!). Could this be due to their high elevation?
On my next pass, I'll try setting the rocket artillery to just "Engage Enemies" rather than that plus "Fire at Waypoint Area". (Perhaps altitude of the area waypoint is taken as the altitude of the firing unit, and engaging enemies will take the altitude of targets into account).
If you want you can set each arty to a certain smaller waypoint. I recommend maybe put them on a semi flat elevation. If they are at too much of an angle they might not be able to aim properly.

hey. i want to have an E-4 Overloard in the air. i dont have a friendly airbase on the map. can i spawn it in mid air so its instnatly there and flying?
Yes
how can i set it up so its flying in 30.000ft?

how can i set it up so its flying in 30.000ft?
i cant set it higher then 10000
The values in the editor are all in metric

is target group 1 (for sending wpt to gps) always 1 if i want it to be the player? (singleplayer)
hey anyone able to talk me through adding player spawns in the editor
trying to do a heli pvp map with FA-26's mixed in

Is the campaign set to MP already?
if not, you have to make a new campaign and make sure to tick the "multiplayer" setting when creating it
gotcha\

Are you in the public testing branch?
...
please hold

Have you created the campaign?
yes
and converted to MP

what target group do i have to define to send a mission waypoint to the gps of the player? (singleplayer)
what?
wait i send a screenshot 😄

so putting the waypoints into sequence should fix my problem?
I’m still not sure what the problem even is
Or what you’re trying to do

You’re sure the event/objective is firing?
yers
yes

What does your GPS screen look like afterwards? Screenshot please
its just empty
hmm how do i get the mission to show up on my list once i saw it?

hmm how do i get the mission to show up on my list once i saw it?
Multiplayer or single player?
What enemy units can attack the carriers ingame?

What enemy units can attack the carriers ingame?
like anti ship roles?
rocket boat

Oh, as in the enemy naval units?
Yo
Anyone know how to fix this issue ?

Anyone know how to fix this issue ?
I am not entirely sure, I think the LMSS ship can use its forward missiles to sink your ships
yo-yo

Looks like the only way to remove a unit from the map is to use a "kill" action. Is that true?
You can delete them
Unless you are in the mission you can setup a kill action to get rid of em

Seems strange for delete to not exist. You bring units to a waypoint next to a building. Maybe they go inside?
The bombers really need lot of clearance to land on airport :/ otherwise they just hit mountains on the alignment
I'm confused

Also, in the MP editor, is there a way to give command of AI units to only one player? Or is it for the entire team
Does anyone know how to launch mp custom games without uploading them
You can't

With the multiplayer officially coming out can we make multiplayer mission and campaigns in the editor yet? Also if we can make a mulitplayer mission in the editor can we make it so the players can fly more then one style of aircraft? Can I have say 2 Helos and 2 airplanes?
The multiplayer missions editor is in development. If you want custom multiplayer missions, check out the public testing branch
Ok thanks. Ill keep my eyes open then.

Timed Event Group  * Begin Immediately (check box) - if checked, the event triggers immediately when mission starts. * Intial Delay - if "Begin Immediately" is not checked, then this sets the delay until event triggers. * Time (s) - applied for individual actions? (added to the initial delay).  Have I got the above correct? Thanks
No
The initial delay is the delay from when it's triggered to when it starts trying to fire the sub events

Is "Time (sec)" applied per action? Is it the duration of the action?
After the event group has been triggered, it'll wait Initial Delay. After that, each sub event is entirely independent, and will wait Time (sec) before firing all the contained actions at the same time
In your screenshotted example, it'll Begin Immediately, wait 0s initial delay, then wait 0s Time(

Oo on that note, can you confirm what "is/is not destroyed" means for the rigs? I haven't gotten to really test it, you can destroy parts, you can also destroy the leg support and make the platform uneven. When is it actually considered "Destroyed"?
when the oilrig is tilted it is considered destroyed
awesome thanks, that means I have an issue elsewhere with my triggers not firing

How do you add in player spawns for the test branch multiplayer missions in the editor?
like in the normal version
you cant add in multiplayer player spawns in the normal version

do you have to do something special before it shows up?
i dont think so
A mission can’t be both single and multiplayer

What is the 'allowed slots' slider do on the ah94? is it for the copilot?
Not for sure, but I assume it's Allowed slots: 1 = only pilot appears as a slot in MP lobby. Available slots: 2 = both pilot and gunner appear as slots in MP Lobby.
yup

what will happen if i add more?
not supported (aka bug, unintented behaviors, and crashes)
i wish the player slots were not locked to a spesific vehicle

Does it still show the mission as 8 player in the list tho ? Like if you have 8 f45 + 8 FA26
ok so now i have a custom mp mission. how do i play it?
you have to upload it to the steam workshop and play it through the games mp function

ok so now i have a custom mp mission. how do i play it?
you have to upload it to the steam workshop and play it through the games mp function
oh

how do you play it? its uploaded, i have it downloaded but i cant select it. only can vote, uninstall, or view info
im idiot
Start a lobby, and choose it

What's it called? I'll load it and debug it
multiplayer testing or something like thhat, no icon. made by 16
i reload the game to see name

@74 It had separate briefings for each team right?
oh lol. yeah.
Ok, well temporary workaround until I fix it would be to make it only one briefing

did you use "copy" options on the mp spawns to make multiple mp spawn?
This is the bug that killed my "Land War" Mission. AH-94 pilot seat goes to F-45. I believe this is related to copy/pasting the MP spawn unit. Haven't been able to run it to ground yet, but that is my current assumption.
If a trigger sets a bomber to bomb a waypoint, will a nearby player cause the bomber to abort? Or will the bomber continue on its run?

If a trigger sets a bomber to bomb a waypoint, will a nearby player cause the bomber to abort? Or will the bomber continue on its run?
IIRC the AI will do its duty unless it is engaged (e.g. the player starts firing missiles at it), then it will evade
If they successfully evade they'll go back to whatever they were doing

@Hoizen  do you still have the mission with the glitch slot that put you in the wrong plane?
yup, haven't touched it since last tested broken. CO-08 Land War (1) in my coop mission pack.
how does it look int the vts file§

Does that unit instance ID show up anywhere else?
Negative. Only two helos: 215 and 216. Both unique IDs.
Can you reorder the spawn id to match the slot list or vice versa?

Can you reorder the spawn id to match the slot list or vice versa?
Currently matching, though I can test the reverse next upload.   215: AH-94 216: AH-94 217: F-26 218: F-26 219: F-45 220: F-45
I need to proof check all my mission slot now just to be sure 😄

so peaking at the vts now... spawnChance = 100, I'm assuming this is default for Alt Spawn 1, I know you can't change it in editor UI... if I changed it here... does it turn into a chance to spawn at all? Assuming not... but that would be very nice to have :P It would be nice to have a quick probability to spawn or not spawn an AI at all.
it s easy to test in sp 😄
just remember that if the mission has been loaded once; you need to reload the game to take the new .vts change

Anyone play around with budgets with MP campaigns? Is the system supported?
didn't tested
can someone help me im trying to make my mission multiplayer by putting it into the campaign editor but I made it on standalone mission and cant find how

Are custom static scenery models supported in the mission editor? (Or the map editor I guess)  I have an idea for something to add to my mission but it won’t work if I can’t make a simple custom model to add.
Btw I was super excited to see I went from about 20 subs to 200+ subs in the last couple days, so now I’ve got extra motivation to make it worth the players time for hitting that subscribe button!
When I launch my scenario in multiplayer it just loads an endless black screen, could someone help?

When I launch my scenario in multiplayer it just loads an endless black screen, could someone help?
No
Thanks @Skumby , are the any options for getting creative?  For instance, are there any models that can be placed by hand editing the map or mission files, that don't normally appear in the editor?

Not that I know of
Mission creators, please, for god's sakes, don't make 15 min straightline heli flights in your missions they're really not fun

anyone know where a guy can get a mission thats just the target practice mission with multiplayer like the freeflight/airshow mission?
I’ll be making one inside of a map wide city for ah-94
Performance be damned

Hi, when I try to test a multiplayer campaign mission in the editor I get the error, that I need to place a player spawn point, I am using the public_testing branch, is this a bug or do I need to place something other than a MP Spawn?
You cannot test MP missions in the editor. Only way is to upload it and test it in-game
ah okay, thanks!

Performance wise, does a ground unit is less expensive on the cpu than a air unit?
Good question. my hypothesis says yes. Sounds like a SP mission stress test time.
tried with 50 tank vs  50 aircraft, but i need better tool to check the perf change than cpu charge which show the same

what if you added another 0?
100 tanks on path
100 planes on orbit:

Does anyone have any documentation and or videos pertaining to making Multiplayer Missions from the basics ?
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor
Anyone know how to fix a blackscreen for when you start a mission?

Anyone know how to fix a blackscreen for when you start a mission?
Thanks.
v1.3.5p1 Multiplayer     - Fixed: black screen when trying to launch a multiplayer game with more than 8 slots on a team with separated briefings (added Separated Large room)

you got too many slot?
Ah
Yeah

what I mean is there's no need, that seems pretty conclusive, yeah?
its not trouble, and it be more accurate
with just 100 tanks vs. 100 jets, a difference of 1.4x is big

Ooi, what are the stats for a completely empty mission?
speaking of which, i think theres an issue with the KC-49, 75 KC-49s perform much worse than 75 MQ-31s
i will try and get profiler data some other time

How many aircraft is there in the mission Naval strike?
It be nice to have a performance cost in the editor , based of unit index and how many spawn from the start.
I'm trying to a make a multiplayer mission on the test branch, but I'm running into a problem uploading to steam. I've added 3 MP Spawns for each team, but it's giving me a 'No player spawn.' error.

or if there's something else I need to do?
can only test them after downloading them from the workshop
Yeah, but I can't figure out how to *upload* it

your campaign has been created with muptiplayer box checked?
That or maybe just get an initial spawn set
also editing .vts file might require game reboot to load  the change properly

Is the mission even inside a campaign?
no, it's a standalone
I don’t believe that’s allowed

There's no point in setting refuel points at airbases, correct?
They're usually meant for FARPS and places that AREN'T at airbases, no?
or tanker

but yes

Is there anyone here ever worked with the custom scenario assets mod? If so could someone tell me if it’s possible to upload workshop content with custom assets and how difficult it is to make custom units?
Also is it possible to make custom missions for multiplayer PvP yet?
Did you read the mod description?

For anyone also having this issue, I disabled the mod loader then revalidated the game files, and it fixed the issue.
Anyone know what 'StayInRadius' behavior for ground units does? I know what is sounds like it should do, but not seeing how to set what radius to stay in haha.

hello mission makers. does anyone have out a mission in which you go into an area and evac soldiers under fire? i've been practicing my j hook landings in the chopper and want to try it out in an evac mission. thanks in advance.
Is there an easy way to take photos for the briefing in the mission editor?

Check out the wiki page for the mission editor, the debug options like free cam and time manipulation might help.

Cheers, yeah just found something about that. Gonna see how to enable it now @bradtank44

I want to get some good screenshots for the image panel in the briefing notes to polish up my mission.  What is the best workflow for that?  I could just play through the mission and take screenshots of the s-cam, but is there a way to pause the game to enable better control over the s-cam for taking the screenshots?  What workflow do you guys use to get good screenshots for your missions?
lol!!!
Insert cam

are you talking about using debug mode instead of launching the mission in the headset?
You cannot launch a mission without a headset
well you kinda can

Do you have to do something specific?
From the mission editor, choose "launch->launch scenario" (CTRL-L)  Choose your pilot, etc. In the "locker room" Just hit the "R" key onyour keyboard and it will jump into the game without you putting on your headset.
then hit "Insert" to enable that debug cam you spoke of.  Then keys like [ and ] to switch units, etc are all active.

Anyone having trouble uploading to the Steam workshop?
When I upload nothing happens and no new mission was uploaded to Steam's workshop.
Tested it with the example mission and it worked. Don't know why mine doesn't even load the UI for uploading.

dang. so it wont let you put that as an objective and finish it with the ah94?
If you have a AV-42 and AH-94 in your mission that s fine
I think it can be simulated. I'll be doing just that to emulate the silly ladder pick-ups of Desert Strike in my Desert Strikes Back campaign. Can't wait to see if it works out :LUL:

can anyone clarify what is the difference between "path" and "railpath" for ground units? As far as I can tell, it seems to have something to do with getting things to move on roads?
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/931756308019945502
whoops, guess I should have searched first

Will only one of these events fire, or is there a chance to fire the first three?
Only one will fire, chosen at random, but it won’t be there even 4 way split I assume you’re expecting
Yes

So, for example, 33% would be 33% and 49.5?
33% for the first, 50% for the second
You are splitting a split cake

I'm doing mission edit, and when I select audio in the briefing screen, can I continue to play the music that was played in note1 in note2?
no, each note stop and play on each slide
hmmmm so sad

Can someone send me a link to instructions on how to add multiplayer spawns for players?
Step 1 is to be editing a multiplayer mission
Where is the option for that in game? Or do I need a mod?

Where is the option for that in game? Or do I need a mod?
You need to be on the public testing branch, and create a mission in a multiplayer campaign
ohhh. ok, i'll try that. Thankyou.

Did I cover all the bases?
If I set the detection mode to force undetected it should make enemy aircraft not detect it right?
Just made a co op mission in the public test branch. I was told you needed to make it in test branch so you can add multiplayer slots so I did. Now none of the aircraft slots can rearm. There are no weapons to choose from. Did I do something wrong or is there a specific work flow I need to follow? Love the game btw guys.

Force detected/undetected only applies to what the player can see on their NAV map

At the beginning of the mission.

Is there a NOT gate?
only "AND" and "OR"
we need nand and xor

Noob to the forum here. I'm having a problem with some enemy armor floating in the air when I load some of my custom missions. They float high, like 4000 AGL. They're still operational, the SAM shoots at me. And other units start driving randomly, either over the moutnains of Akutan or into the sea. Does anyone know how to stop all that from happening? I'm trying to finish off a campaign.
So I have to publish my milt-player mission before I can test it because it doesn't show up in the multiplayer  menu.
how do i make a mp campaign

On another note are unit movement speeds in the editor (for ground vehicles) in knots?
all in metric
POG

Thats a very beautiful map, I'm a VFX artist who has fallen upon this beautiful map and mission editor, I've got my first solid mission complete, and very short campaign planned, but for sure need to look into maps like yours. Did you use a height map for that, Saybro?
na i think that one comes with the game
Ahhh cool. At work, I use all kinds of amazing assets, and I am just dying to apply that to this.

Wow man, holy crap, Thank you, how nice is that of you? Dude, thanks. I used the Map editor to make my own and use a few sat map shots of Syria to create my own chunk for my first stab at using the Mission Editor to really tell a real life story to the player as a part of that story. I cant stop finding things in the mission editor that are surprising me, I've wanted something like this to use for a while. Thanks again, you are too cool, thank you.
There's one other thing I kind of find I need, and dont know how to make happen. I need a Reset - or Repeat node in the command tree. I really would like to be able to have a string Reset, and be able to be Tripped again, perhaps with a TIME delay box like many of the other nodes have. It would be beyond useful, to be able to have a message that could be tripped by Proximity alone, and display a message, or play a radio reply. Is that functionality there somewhere beyond my couple days work so far? I use nodal systems like this at work for years and years, so within a couple hours I had most things working, but couldnt find that functionality.
No. There is no way y to fire an event twice. There are no loops

Damn, thank you so much, I asked once before a few days ago, but it seemed like it might be there, thank you for the answer.

I wonder then, would there be a way to cascade the effect, have One, turn on another as it is tripped? So, you would stack the pile, with the top tripping the next, tripping the next, etc?
Kind of a Faked repeat
It would be so nice to just have a node at the end before Output and was a reset with delay, soooo useful

Ohhhh!!!!!!! Cool, ok, I'll try that today. So, you would have an Event, thats trigged by an event, but, is there a Delay to activate node so its not a line of firecrackers?
Check out the sequence event type
If I wanted a sound by proximity, but, the player would have to break the proximity barrier to make it happen, Each Time

any reason why im not able to test spawn?
can t test in editor
Nah this is base game, not gonna get into map editing. It's for one of the F/A-26B missions I believe in the campaign

I know shift is the fast button (faster movement, rotation, etc.) of the cursor but is there also a slow button? I tried alt and ctrl. Ctrl seems to prevent the cursor from moving
Does anyone know why units arent following paths?
can you elaborate? units should be able to follow paths

Does anyone know why units arent following paths?

I have a tanker drone set to a path with t points so it just flies back and forth over 20 miles. I have that set as it's default path and I have it's behavior set to follow path. All it does is circle the first point. The path is on a loop. And it's 10,000ft altitude

I created a campaign for stable branch, then adjusted it for MP on public testing. The file extension changed by having MP added to the end. Apparently, the campaign for stable branch still gets overridden by the PT one, even with the different file extension. Has any one else experienced this, or knows how to remedy it?

That would be how I'd expect it to work. You'd need to make a copy of the campaign and work on that copy, if you want a version of how it was before you changed stuff
Got it thanks

I am on public testing and making a multiplayer mission. Also could it be the I start the drone too close to the path?
Also I have changed the speeds to 200kn initial and 275kn default
i am running on stable, so it might be that. you could increase the distance from the path or maybe the overlapping path might be the issue. you could also try making it a slightly elliptical path

Do we still need to be on public testing to do multiplayer custom missions?
afaik you do
dang

did you try sending path via event?
No it seemed unnecessary since it was set as default behavior but I will
Is there any way to change a multiplayer spawn point based on the completion of an objective? I kinda wanna try to make a push gamemode

Is there any way to change a multiplayer spawn point based on the completion of an objective? I kinda wanna try to make a push gamemode
no
I have also had issues relying on default behavior and have taken to just keeping it default none,parked and using an "init" immediate timer event that fires all the pathing/movement. You can't set default formation anyway so I end up having to do the init event regardless.

@ChadGatling  are you on PTB or main build ? I cant repro, my drone is following my path
I'm doing it on a MP mission. Which requires PT
oh I missed that, let me retry on my MP playground

might sound stupid, but maybe try  to check game file integrity in steam?
I verified game files and some need fixing but it still refuses to follow a path
Dang, I dont know then :/

can you send me your mission file?
I can check locally
Its uploaded if thats what you mean

ok , what the name?
Team Carrier ops Training
What kind of path is expect from the tanker ? so I know if it work or not on my side?

What kind of path is expect from the tanker ? so I know if it work or not on my side?
Should be following a heading of 033 for 20 miles
Then loop

did you try adding a 3rd point to your path?
i knew of some different game code that didnt work with 2 point path
Why would they have a 500m orbit?

Why would they have a 500m orbit?
ill try a third point
Yes but why? they are set to path

Yes but why? they are set to path
not sure,  but this is super weird behavior
Uploading now with more points

Did you make their default behavior to follow the path?
IIRC there is some issue with default behavior, most people found that making a timed event that fires immediately with stuff like setting paths works better
Ok so the 2 points path was the issues, having more point fixed it. Good to know.

so how do i define players spawning on a carrier?
if i have a carrier and the mission set for a specific plane, can they just spawn on it whenever?
If it’s anything like single player, you do it on the carrier unit’s settings

if i have a carrier and the mission set for a specific plane, can they just spawn on it whenever?
If it’s anything like single player, you do it on the carrier unit’s settings
There’ll be a tab at the top to assign planes to spots

Right but I can only spawn one player spawn despite being in the beta branch, I thought beta lets you make multiplayer compatible missions?
you have to make a special multiplayer campaign i believe
Eh. Sadly there is almost no interesting scenarios for long flights like in DCS... So I'll try to make one xd

any way to make enemy air units spawn at airfields and actually use them to take off?
can place them there manually but it does not seem to treat it any different as spawning in air
you need to order them to take off

if i add helicopters to a multi-role mission, does that prevent people without the dlc from playing even if they select a plane?
no
awesome

Is it me or does the IsLanded conditional not work properly?
It works for me. You have to slow down under 50 knots I believe and be within the radius of the specified waypoint
And be landed 😛

Maybe it's broken for the MP editor?
Maybe its the negation of it? I use it to test for players having taken off. I use Player Is Not Landed
I believe players start a little in the air, so it’s possibly triggering immediately

That was one of the issues I was having in the past

Do individual player objectives work for MP? Or you just have to have the same objectives that everyone sees? Or like individual takeoff objectives?
… is there a Takeoff objective type?
Regardless, I believe all objectives are team-based

… is there a Takeoff objective type?
Regardless, I believe all objectives are team-based
I mostly work with conditionals so By takeoff objective I just mean one that I make that is a takeoff objective and not a specific type of objective for take off. It was just an example

Oh we can't compare 2 global values to each other?
Huh. No, I don’t believe so
damn

You can just port over to MP?
yup
copy your mission into your mp campaign, before loading the game, edit the .vts to make sure Multiplayer = True and IsConfigurable = True. Then in editor remove the Player spawn and add your MP spawn. Voila

I am moving a MP over to SP. I named my campaign the same name as the mission. What do I need to copy over?
I just compared it to the missions
Superb new feature in the new version

is mp mission creating in the public testing yet?
yes
do ai wingmen work?

Do event sequences run in order and the exit condition must pass before the next Entry condition will be checked?
Yes
Or at least “I can come up with a way to read that that is true”

Anyone want to help me test my spawn trigger? You just have to spawn
I hate to ask such a newbie question, but I've had a bunch of tries at it, and cant seem to get the passenger pickup/drop off working. I have units boarding the VTOL but its not taking off and dropping off at the destination waypoint. Just the basic pick up and drop off. TIA.
Every Tuesday steam has a maintenance

Did you gave them a rally waypoint ? and you selected the unit that need to be dropped off? on the drop off objective
If I do a conditional triggered by a player in a MP mission is that just the host?
I can't figure out how to detect when a unit has taken of in MP

nvm

Do triggers only fire once?
correct
what you could do

Do I have to reload the game?
yes mission editor data stay loaded in memory
Another great fix : Mad4 radar / launcher can now be deployed , undeployed, for maximum randomness SAM site

Does it work by enabling then checking and disabling?
I think it is checked each frame, if global value = x continue
As long it is enabled

Do your global value start at 0?
yes
Its a trigger that trigger on conditionnal?

Its a trigger that trigger on conditionnal?
@Hoizen  yes I did non required objective that I enable to let player know how much life they have (using MP death). But if we can manipulate team score a bit further I would also use that.
So I could just have the objective activate on conditionnal.

Hey how do I make a mission end when an airbase changes teams?
Airbases change teams when you tell them to, so end the mission at the same time, I guess
yes its checking for global variably equals 0

Does it Need to follow a Take Off with an Altitude to actually complete the action?
They’ll firm up in the order you placed them
First one down/assigned the the group will be lead

How do I put the player in an air group btw?
With NPCs
The same way you put npcs in a group

@Skumby any idea why it wouldn't show?
Multiplayer?
Yeah

fr? so no AI wingmen
Guess not
that sucks

Off the wall, has anyone had issues in MP where an event is shown differently between players? I have a rocket arty salvo hitting an area, i see the rounds go where they are supposed to, however, my friend sees them engaging us and hitting us (but i do not) The hits do register too (damage me and him)
hm I use Arty on shot waypoint but I never saw has a client perspective, so I dont know
Am I dumb or was there a drone carrier? Am I blind? Should I stop drinking?

Am I dumb or was there a drone carrier? Am I blind? Should I stop drinking?

is there any way for bomber to attack way points instead of units etc?

is there any way for bomber to attack way points instead of units etc?
for a runway attack for example
Appreciate it. Made some changes and still seems to be an issue. As host, the arty does attack the players, but the other players see it attacking them and me (both get damaged) definitely strange. More messin around with it hopefully

Maybe baha wants a new aircraft for team B rather than reskinned team A's one?
Tho would be nice in general to put any unit on either team
MAD-4's for everyone!

does earning money during the mission from completing objectives not work when launching from the editor kind of like the base budget doesn't? i was trying to balance my mission out and wasn't seeing the rewards
Good question, is there a way to see available money in mission?
when you land and rearm

Good question, is there a way to see available money in mission?
when you land and rearm
I'm not even sure you get paid for completing objectives during the mission. It might only be applied to the campaign cap after you're done

.yes if you set the reward on kill right?
I'm not seeing it added when I land and rearm
ahhhhh

does the mission editor open outside of VR? I don't think I'd last long trying to make a whole mission in VR..
It’s not in vr
opens on my pc?

Another newbie question. Whats the trick to being able to REPAIR when landing at a refuel/repair pad? I land, it allows me to reload, refuel, but not repair. Oddly.
(And I learned the chopper is capable of limping home with 1 blade broken in half, and Another clipped off at tip! was shocked!
Repairing can be disabled by the scenario author, so it might be that

Where is that in the editor?
I didnt see a switch to allow / dsallow
Bottom right of the scenario options, iirc

Another question as I prepare my first campaign. When uploading to Steam, does it take Only the items used in the mission/Campaign, or, does it upload Everything in the work folder? Unused sounds etc?
It only uploads the stuff that the mission uses
Wicked, thats what I thought, just didnt want to upload a ton of junk. Thanks.

Is the wiki correct that carriers top out at 15 m/s?
seems about right
close to slow vehicle at 10 M/s

Is there anyway to make it so the allied cruiser uses its forward vertical launched missiles to target specific threats such as an infantry on the ground? Or is it possible to make it so it attacks specific air targets which are landed..?
You may be able to assign it as a Priority target?
Unit, then (pick the unit), then- Action - Assign Priority Target - Pick the target

Doesn't it fire a radar guided missile? I don't think it can track a ground target. The allied cruiser has a cannon on the bow though, might try using that. Not sure what kind of range it has

I don't think I can do this, but is there any way to create an event that will add fuel to the players vehicle?  Or is the only way the player can refuel is to go through the comms menu in their MFD?
To clarify, this is for the AH-94, not in air refueling.

I just tested out the mp mission editor in public_testing, published to steam workshop, etc...  If go back to the main branch for my game install I assume I just need to make sure I don't try to open up any of my mp/public_testing stuff in the old (stable) version of the game right?  There aren't any other gotchas that I need to worry about when switching back and forth are there?
Not sure what'd happen. You'd likely be fine even opening them, as long as you don't save. It'd possibly crash, but that wouldn't corrupt your content
If I host a MP game in the public_testing branch and I choose my custom MP mission from the steam workshop, will others that try to join my game automatically download the custom mission?  I want to do some beta testing with friends today and want to make sure I give them the right instructions/expectations.

Cool Thanks @Strikeeaglechase

Paolo, is there a Media Kit to be DL somewhere? I need the BD PNG logo for the briefing screens and cant find one on either website or off google (other than the 320 rez version) - got a link for that somewhere I'm missing?
what like this?
Ya, thats the lil one

How would I set a friendly air group to loiter until the player forms up on them? I have a part of my mission where the player is to escort a SEAD team to an enemy airbase, but I'm not sure how to prevent the SEAD team from moving toward the objective until the player is actually in the air. I currently have the player air group and SEAD air group separated.
Order them to circle a waypoint where you want them to wait
and when the player enters a radius nearby, they go to their next objective/form up on the player/whatnot

Is that something I would add through the event tab? I tried to add a sequenced event where they orbit until the flight group meets up with them, but they would always fly straight to the objective. Although, it could be that my radius is too large.
did you set up the conditions properly?
mind sending a screenshot?

did you set up the conditions properly?

I'm not sure haha. I'm very new to the editor.

Is the first picture the entry or exit conditional?
Let me double check real quick
It’s the exit condition

Ok cool, thanks! And in the unit configuration tab for the SEAD group, should I set default behavior to orbit to prevent them from going to the path right off the bat?
Then set an event group for following the path after the exit condition is met?
one moment

Then set an event group for following the path after the exit condition is met?

spawn them as TakeOff

Can you spawn a unit or group at a specific waypoint with an event? Or is the only option random with the alt spawns?
You could just have a lot of duplicates of those craft at all the possible spawn points
Yeah I thought about that but assumed it would be resource intensive. Also, a pain in the ass

On that same topic, what about an unspawned ship containing a player spawn point. Or a ship containing a spawn point getting destroyed. What happens? Will the slot selection in the briefing room appear/ disappear to reflect availability?
maybe? That's a good question
I recommend you test it, and update us too please

That might be a while. I'm still in the ideas stage. Also, I need maps to facilitate my ideas.

Do events that trigger radio message actions work in the public_testing MP stuff yet?  I tried to set one up and it wasn't working.  Just wondering if I need to do something special to get those to work, or just wait.
it works
Hmmm I got no audio in my MP mission with this.  And I've succsssfully done radio messages in other non MP missions I have worked on.

@BahamutoD just so i know i'm not going crazy, are radio messages supported yet for MP missions in public_testing?  I've tried both play message and play team message actions and I'm just not getting any of them to play
@Steakfest  add a 7 sec delay before playing your audio
the event start immediatly even tho you might not be yet in the world yet (after you press enter)

I've tried every possible combination I can think of.  Timed Events, Sequence Events, Objectives, I can not for the life of me get an audio file to play over the radio in this MP mission.  @L etranger can you confirm that you have successfully gotten a radio message to play in the public testing branch on a multiplayer enabled mission?  In these screenshots,  I have an event sequence "Intro Sequence" that is triggered by an initial timed event.  I know the timed event is working, because the objective gets started as expected.  I even tried to play the audio as events from the objective start and that wouldn't play either.
I do have audio working properly.
if you preview your file it does play in editor; correct?

if you preview your file it does play in editor; correct?
your scripting looks good
Yep, plays just fine, and I don't have problems with audio on the main branch of the editor with my single player stuff.  Only seem to be having trouble here on public_testing with multiplayer

did you converted your mission into mp?
I ran into an issue where a ressource audio was missing from my .vts file, and it was making any radio to fail to play.
one ogg missing from the mission ressources would make none of them play

@Steakfest  nor host or client can hear the radio; correct?
I was only testing on the host.
did you try with a different ogg file?

did you try with a different ogg file?
how do you mark a mission as multiplayer?
is it on the workshop or in the editor

how do you mark a mission as multiplayer?
is it on the workshop or in the editor
you first have to be on public testing and then select a campaign and you should see the tick box

is it only for campaigns?
sadly yes
The "campaign" is really just a folder you lump all the missions you want into. So players selecting missions when they make a lobby dont have to scroll through a long list.

Was your radio volume in the cockpit turned up?
Yes. Volume was maxed out for all dials.
@Baconism  I have a technique where if you’re firing at a line of targets you can fire a dozen rockets, then slew the laser across the line right before impact to hit all of the targets

would you mind sharing your mission folder? I could test on my end
Anyone know how many hits of each munition type it takes to sink carriers and cruisers (both teams)?  And does hitting a component such as radar or cwis count against the ship?
I think 4 /5 agm65?  but that a good question for the wiki

Sea groups seem to always make an arrowhead formation. Is there any determinate way to know which position each ship will take in the formation? It doesn't seem to correlate to the order units are added to the group.
check actions in events there might be a formation for ships
Actually, it might be ordering them from right to left. Have to run it a few times to see.

@L etranger FYI, I tried other ogg files that have worked just fine, and still no audio.  I also added some tutorial text to the same events so I could be certain my events were all firing and i'm seeing the tutorial text, but something is preventing these radio messages from playing...    Did you happen to attempt to load the mission and see if you heard anything?
To try to debug this audio issue i'm having, I have a question...  When I download from the steam workshop a campaign that I created and uploaded, where does the downloaded version of the campaign go?  I assume those files end up in a different spot than the ones I'm editing with the editor.  So where can I go to see the files after they've made the round trip up and down from steam so I can see if there is something missing, (like an ogg file)
Found this I think...   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\...........

So, even found the downloaded steam workshop files and all the audio files are there, they just won't play in the mission...

I think radio volume on the cockpit knob also impact mission comm?
All volumes knobs are all the way up…. Hearing all multiplayer comms.

do you have an antivirus?

dunno man this is weird

When I started up the game I expected to have to create a new pilot, since the save data was gone, etc, (along with the other settings)  but I did not have to do that.  (must use steam cloud to recover that stuff?)  Anyway, when I started my mission from the steam workshop, it worked as expected...
Saves are in app data/roaming
Glad to hear man

Or the game ogg reader got busted? If that can be a thing?
except i would think that would have gotten fixed by previous reinstall/verify ops I had done...
so now my install is very clean, none of my custom maps, scenarios, campaigns are in those folders, as expected but I can move those back in from my backup.   But what's weird is the "SaveData" folder that had those gameSettings, inputbinding, etc...   are no longer there.  maybe there is a difference with public testing where those are now in appdata but they weren't before?  Because I haven't tried installing the older version.  Maybe @BahamutoD moved SaveData from the "install dir" to the "AppDir/Roaming" in this public_testing branch, and maybe something I did caused some jank between them and somehow broke audio.  I can think of one thing I might have done to my pilots.cfg file by hand, and that would have been to swap the order of the pilots, because my primary pilot wasn't the firset one in the list anymore and I was getting tired of constantly clicking through the list to get to it during my testing.   I don't know for sure if I made that change right before testing the audio in my mission or not though, so certainly not a smoking gun, but definitely a lead.  And I don't know where I made that change either, because I never saw that file in two different places until just now so I couldn't tell you where I first found it.

going to now switch to main branch, test, and then switch back to see if it all still works.
then carefully put my custom content back into the directories so I can go into the editor.

how does capturing work? destroying all enemies in an area?
Correct
If Im in the TADS using the targeting sight what is that - RADAR - TGP - TSD or ARAD? I want to flip a event when the player targets something, but not sure which is which here. TIA

is TSD the targeting sight display on screen in the cockpit? The TADS display? That would be my optimal choice.
TGP is the only thing that would make sense. I wonder if ground radar = radar for that purpose

For anyone who cares, sea groups do actually form up based on the order units are added to the group.  Examples:  If you have a sea group of 5 units, `A B C D E`  They will form up like so: ``` |   |   | A |   |   | |   | B |   | C |   | | D |   |   |   | E |```  This group of 5, `C B D A E`  Will make this formation: ``` |   |   | C |   |   | |   | B |   | D |   | | A |   |   |   | E |```

I've set the player to spawn on a cruiser, cold start, but their landing gear is up? Watup wit dat
┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)
😔

Did you place the player on the cruiser, or did you assign the player to the cruiser?
I placed it just over it
lol, that explains it

Ohh thanks, it wont lock on a dead unit will it? I've mastered flying, not the targeting yet hahah
(RedElite, thanks, I wasnt sure which it was in the selection menu)
Pretty sure you can’t lock dead targets

If I have a Campaign and a single Scenario under that Campaign, If I wanted to create a clone of the Scenario in the same Campaign I would think I would do the following:  * Duplicate the directory * change the directory name to something different * Change the name of the .vts file to match the new directory name * Change the Scenarioid in the .vts file to match * Open in Editor  I did all that and got this dialog, so what step might I be missing?
Maybe I need to change campaignOrderIdx too?
I think that was it, Not getting the dialog anymore

What does Detection Mode =  Force Undected do?    Does it stop units from getting the red and blue indicators around them when they're seen?

What does Detection Mode =  Force Undected do?    Does it stop units from getting the red and blue indicators around them when they're seen?
It prevents the craft from being able to be seen by enemies
so if the enemy is a human player, it doesn't really have an effect?

so if the enemy is a human player, it doesn't really have an effect?
force undetected is for example hidding an Allied AI unit from showing on the map
for search and rescure or surprise mf scenario

If a unit diverts from a path, is it because it's engaging something?
Certainly a possibility
They’re also not a fan of flying into the ground

Rail paths or regular paths?
Ground units will always follow paths
reg paths

Does Rail Path circumvent the group behavior? And if so, do path events work if they're set to that behavior? This would save me sooooo much time
Nothing circumvents group behaviour
Not even waypoint events?

Is there a trick to getting Ground units to follow a path? I have paths laid out, both on the surface level and a foot above(Just in case the surface was a factor in them not working), I have Soldiers, set to Path, or Railpath, or Follow, and then set to the selected path, and nada. Set it as an action in an event, nothing, its odd. I can get them to move to waypoints, but not just walk a patrol path. Happy Friday, thanks for all the help this week, almost got things to 100%
using an event is the "correct" way
or rather, the way that should work

Is it in a group?
Yes
it is, in a large group that Isnt on the path

How is the Leader designated?
that fits to the Follow function Im sure
first spawned in the group.

is there a way to play custom missions using multiplayer?
oh ok
are you on public testing

I don't suppose there is any way to do a comparison in the conditional editor to a global value, or some other variable is there?  I want to do some conditional logic that doesn't compare itself to just a constant value if possible...
I don't see how that compares team a kills to a global value.
It only triggers if both the kill count and the variable are equal

Can you only use visual scripting?
For the mission editor? Yeah
Is there any plans to change that

For the mission editor? Yeah
Is there any plans to change that
No public ones

wdym? Its all visual based
what interprets the blocks
The underlying logic is written in C#

so if typescript bad, then C# bad?
Typescript isn't javascript
take a step back and write it in C

does brainfuck count as high level?
no
I have no experience with brainfuck, but if it exists and is well documented...

so about as good as whitespace?
yep
you only need an 2 incrementors, RAM and a comparison engine

wait you can write mission scripting in notepad??
You can edit the .VTS files to Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V parts that would be too repetitive to do in the editor
^

then you'd just directly edit the VTS no?
If I was doing it manually yeah
no

Looking at events and actions, is there a way to end the mission?  Or do I need to complete an objective that's marked as final to do that?
You need to complete all objective that are marked mandatory for completion
if none are present, the moment the scenario is loaded, it counts as won (not sure how it's handled in MP)

maybe the host skipped the mission without you knowing?
or everyone just pressed respawn
That too

How come some older missions on workshop complete at a seemingly arbitrary objective?
*shrug*
There may be other ways to complete a mission, but that's the way I know

Tropical? Where do you find this? I just checked in PT too and only found Boreal, Desert and Arctic. Am I missing someting?
Decompiling revealed it, hand editing the map file used it
Sick! let me test it.

The scenario editor for MP shows the same tooltip for "score/kill" and "score/death" that it shows for "Budget".  Does that mean that the points earned for kills / deaths is added to the budget, or is that just a copy/paste bug?   I want to use kills/deaths to come up with a scoring system for a multiplayer map, but not if it just ads to the budget that each team has.  (I don't want to limit rearming costs)
I suspect it’s a copy/paste bug
Yeah it is

And followup question.  if I wanted to award 20 points for a kill and subtract 10 points for a death, do i have to put in -10?  or is it already implied that the deaths are a negative.
Thanks @Skumby and @Strikeeaglechase
Thanks again!

If someone drops from the game, I assume their score is retained, so using score vs. kills makes for a better winning condition if you're worried about someone losing 1/2 their team late in the game to dropped connections, or just having to leave in general?
Thanks for the Pathing Info yesterday guys, got it all working last night.
Everyone here has been super cool and super helpful, just straight up answers, and its let me keep building and tightening up my campaign. Still trying to figure out the "TADS Target on the ground to flip a switch, but almost there. The node for the LockTarget can be left at None...so Ill try to get that to cause a positive, perhaps just Using the TGP is enough, or, I was thinking perhaps if its targeted and then the "Using Weapon" tag might be enough to lock it and flip it? If so, whats the "short hand" for a Hellfire? AGM-114?

OMG thank you! I had no idea and didnt want to send it blind, Ill try that today, thanks so much

Here's a question thats on my mind. What is the green Ring that locks onto a target called? When you actual pull the trigger to "Lock ON" with a missile? but have not let the missile loose yet...when you get the tone to fire...what is that called? Id like a trigger when That happens, not when the targeting reticlue first snaps to it on the TADS display. Does that have a different name? Is that function the TSD? Hope everyones having a great weekend, Thank you for the info on how to run the complete mission Including the briefing, was my first time after a few weeks learning and work, really cool to see it all as one piece.
I don’t believe that’s an option either
Huh! Dang! Interesting tho. Thanks, there are a few selections in that drop down, I know RADAR and TGD, the other 2 I dont know yet

IF I wanted to re-use a map, for a new Mission, within a Campaign, do I need to re-save the map or something other than just deleting all the actions and such and Save As with the new missions name?
Map or scenario?
Ummm Scenario, I want to re-use the map, with the towns and roads Ive made. Thats where I am a lil comfused. Last night then I loaded thru the Custom Scenarios, I was all of them, versions and such, all under the map I made, I expect that will be a no no when uploading it, and hence I thought to ask

When I am in the Mission editor, the name in the upper right is the Map in use?
Yes, and I made that in the map editor
The scenario has all the units and events and objectives

can I do that and have it be used as the next mission base?
Sure. Use Save As.
Ok killer

@L etranger did the single scenario have the exact same id/name/foldername as the one within the campaign?
just the same foldername as the one in the campaign
I restored the single scenario from the bin to double check, and yes the radio is gone

stupid question: hows a fella make a multiplayer mission. do i need a mod? ive made single missions before but i don't see how to make it multiplayer
You have to be in the public testing branch right now. Make a campaign and check the multiplayer box
got it, is there a way to let players select which airframe they want to fly? as opposed to just forcing everyone into one airframe per mission?

got it, is there a way to let players select which airframe they want to fly? as opposed to just forcing everyone into one airframe per mission?
sadly no
damn...

Using public testing branch v1.3.6p2 using multiplayer lobby, any time I ask my wingmen to form up, the KC-49 and E-4 Overlord decide to form up as well.  The larger planes seem to lack the property of "set player commands" within triggers and in their own settings in the mission editor, unless I'm missing something i can change elsewhere?
They're not really meant to be used as wingmen. Nor do I think wingmen are even supported in multiplayer atm
wait your telling me I can fly in formation wih the E4 and KC-49 :risitas:

Will tanker and awacs follow you down NOE?
this is the scenario if you want to have them both flying behind you, in mission 1 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2746015854
Not sure if they go NOE or not

Is an entry or exit condition necessary? Or is the next node simply executed if none is set?

depend
Entry happens after the Delay

It doesn't show up in scenario info?
Is it possible to freeze an aircraft in the air at a specific point?
It does but I can only play as the A/V 42. WHen I click on the button in the editor to change the vehicel nothing happens

Is the mission linked to a campaign?

Is the mission linked to a campaign?
I took it out of the campaign folder. I am working on it in the standalone mission editor
Make sure in the vets file it's not set to a campaign

What's the condition to finish that objective? It might be getting completed immediately, or not have an objective, or be completed before it's even triggered
The mission ends when the player completes the last active objective. I suspect you’re starting an objective in the On Complete actions of a previous objective.  There’s going to be the briefest of moments between the two when there’s no active objective, so the mission completes
Use the PreReq start type to chain objectives like that

And the follow behaviour whats that?
I've never got it to do anything
okay

How effective is the Z20x2 Anti Air artillery in destroying missles and bombs? If it can do both, how do you destroy it?
It's not great
How do i call the MQ-31 ingame? At mission start she is located on an carrier

stay in radius make infantry wander around a WYP; its good to simulate FOB activity
or triggers must start it?

or triggers must start it?
All refuelling are blind and deaf
Yeah, triggers

Is there a way to complete an objective where the condition is no enemy unit alive in a certain radius?
Unitlist > not any near waypoint
oh nice thanks

ok, something i'm confused about.  Does the game have any collision detection between players in multiplayer?  obvioiusly we've seen no collisions in our free-flight and air show missions.  But is that something that can be changed?  Or does the multiplayer engine just not support that yet?
trying to test a multiplayer map. says tat it cant because theres no player spawn, i have 8 player spawn points, any advice?
only in SP afaik

Need MP spawn; not player. Make sure the .vts is multiplayer =true, Also you can't test MP mission in editor, only from steamworkshop

Will every body get the Message Displayed or is this the way to display the message locally?  I would like that if a new player, who could not read the briefing, gets a small info, as soon as he turns on the battery. The question is whether everyone gets the message or only the one who just flipped the battery switch.
everybody will get it
sad

Is there a feature request channel? I think the ability to read the briefing as someone who joins late is a feature that benefits a large percentage of players.
public  testing or vtorldev
yeah this would be very useful for custom missions when people start joining new ones in the middle of a match

There’s no button to request to control briefing when the mission is in progress?
Sounds like it’s useful
Once the mission starts the screen switches to the scoreboard and wont go back

Do some units have more of a performance hit? E.g radars have more complex logic load  Mostly wondering cos I've played a few missions with not great performance but in my own messing around I can place quite a lot of units without issue  Is it certain units? Other game logic/scripting etc? Or is it to do with projectiles in the air etc

Did you compare to 0 vehicles?
Or was it just frame rate of planes /frame rate of tanks?
fps diff, same ratio with 200 tanks vs 200 planes

Or was it just frame rate of planes /frame rate of tanks?

Was the tank frame rate different when you doubled them?

How do you convert a singleplayer mission to MP and add it to a campaign?
multiplayer = True in the vts file
then copy your mission into your campaign

how do I do the second bit?
just find your campaign folder here
that's what I was looking for, I overlooked the campaign folder

stupid question, how do you start a AH-94 multiplayer mission?
click multiplayer, host a game, choose a mission that has the AH-94 in it
i meant when creating a mission. like making my own

how would one do that?
in steam, right click VTOL VR, click properties
click the Betas tab

Okay cool! now to play it with friends do they need to be in the testbranch aswell?
yes
cool

Now how do i convert the mission to multiplayer?
I believe there's multiplayer spawn points you set
i've yet to get around to making a MP mission myself yet, so I'm afraid that's about as far as I can help you, lol beyond what I've seen discussed in the channel already

how do I move actions in nodes?
I need to move an action to the top
@Ethans there is a gray box that you can grab onto to drag things, but I think there are some contexts where the order you place things can't be changed, or maybe doesn't matter.

Was it ever addressed if MP missions actually support multi-vehicle missions, like the Air Show missions currently do?
like 2 AH-94s, some F/A-26s and F-45s?
throw in an AV-42C for the fun of it

like 2 AH-94s, some F/A-26s and F-45s?
throw in an AV-42C for the fun of it
yea this is possible, you can put any vehicle you want as a MP spawn, it even lets you select the amount of slots per AH-94 if you just don't want a gunner

Is there a way to preset a list of gps points or nav points so they are populated in the gps on mission start? I'm wanting the player to be able to select any point on the list at any time to be able to activate navigation to it. I know I could do it with a bunch of generic objectives and waypoints but that will get confusing with regular objectives.
Yup. You can send gps points in an action. Think it’s in the system category
I created a PlayBGM event on the editor screen when I was creating a multi-mission. I selected a song and clicked on the speaker symbol to test, but the background music does not play. Is this test function broken now?

mp3 or ogg?
tbh it was always kind broken, restart the game and try again

@L etranger @Freedomplaza  I saved the game, restarted it, and tried both mp3 and ogg, but the test play button for background music doesn't seem to work... Is there any other way I can try?
double check your audio is set right
it may have switched to your vr headset

does anyone know how to add a smoke grenade effect in the mission editor?
I also can't get an AI tank to follow a path. I set it to path, follow and railpath (and honestly have no clue what the difference between them, the wiki has no information about these settings). I have the default path set to the path I made and it still refuses to move
Is it part of a group?

Is it part of a group?
Well there aren’t any smoke grenades but you can always use a flare using action
I feel incredibly stupid, lol. I searched this channel to see if I could find the issue and I was pretty sure I never assigned the tank a group, and I guess I did

Is there a way to giv e the player an ability to trigger a trigger from the comms page?
LIke, where I create a custom comms group like "support" and have a command in comms for them to call in arty or whatever
Well you could use the “mfd-bottom-1” as a condition

Is the "reward" a monetary reward that gets added to their budget for buying future weapons?
I believe it's only at the end of the mission, or at least that's how it works in single player
Thanks!

Like, pull the map from GTA San Andreas, and import it into VTOL VR?
yes someone can, and that someone should be you
the map editor is free to be used by all

I might be missunderstanding something im reading, but it looks like they should be able to kill bunkers?
I thought so, too.
Bunkers have a minimum damage of 150, tanks deal 151 damage

Where are you getting those numbers?
yeah should be able to then
"naughty methods"

okay so how many hps does a bunker have?
150
150

unless min damage is subtracted?
Well, I let some tanks have a go at it for a while and they didn't make any progress.
what's the min damage for the allied bunker?

what's the min damage for the allied bunker?
no?
iv heard recent reports that bunkers might be a bit buggy with when they take damage

Wanna report that chase, or should I?
you can
500lb will

is this table of damage values and stuff posted anywhere?
None exists rn
I'd be a big help for map making to know what kind of performance to expect from what units

is it possible to launch a mission from the editor without headset and with a dev camera? I just wanna see if far away units are doing what I think
you can have dev camera, im not sure if you need a headset for it tho
how do you use dev camera?

how do you use dev camera?
press insert on your keyboard
then use brackets

does it include modded weapons?
temperz I bet literally every weapon in nbda can kill bunkers because boris told you to give it a lot of damage
aim280 cannot

ummm wat? Hydras can't kill bunkers. That's why I didn't list them
oh
your list is confusing

anyone know the ranges on the radars? wiki says 55k range on the S/A but im pretty sure i was being picked up at around 65k over open water
hmm.. anyone know if i could take screenshots inside mission editor without all those overlays, like it would be in-game.. ?
could just crop em in MS paint

hmm.. anyone know if i could take screenshots inside mission editor without all those overlays, like it would be in-game.. ?
could just crop em in MS paint
i mean, the cursor, the 'ghost' buildings and names etc

What aircraft are you flying?
Oh god imagine if the enemy military was willing to destroy buildings in order to win
Level the city with you in it

If you want to be scrubby, you can launch a 145 from 45nm away if you climb to 55k ft and exceed mach? I forget the speed, but quite fast
Cruise missiles would 100% be my solution to the MAD-4 on an oil platform problem. XD
On flat ground you'd have a very tough time. Your only chance would be to get the missile to climb up then get under and notch it once it pitbulls

So if you topple the platform the units on top will float there and still be active?
*Can* you actually topple an oil platform in VTOL VR?
Yes

*Can* you actually topple an oil platform in VTOL VR?
Yes
Hit any 2 legs with an agm or bomb

My rockets just arent launching, what am I doing wrong? I have a proxy trigger thats going off, the rockets are standing up, I have a list of Added Priority targets, but, no launching. theres a Radar selected thats active and has Engage enemies selected as well. Very odd, Ive tried a few ways to Sunday on it, and have to return to ask. TIA.
if its rocket artillery, you have to give a fire order on a waypoint, and it wont need a radar if its a SAM site, please stop calling them rockets, its confusing
MAD-4

I am stumped. I created a mission in the public testing for multiplayer. I did a small play test with some friends. I hosted it, we all joined like normal. We started it, it would go solid for 1 min. Then whoever hosted (we rotated after it happened the first time) would crash. Full crash, game would end, doesn’t even end with a bit responding. I have no idea what’s happening, anyone have any idea? (It’s a standard 16 player mission)
I would recommend sending your player.log
To get your player.log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows Key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: %appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log". 4. Upload this file into #public_testing, or whatever channel you are asked to do so in.

Im sure this has been asked, is there a way to make multiple aircraft available to be chosen in the editor?
Yes
the MP editor allows you to do that

Do airbases come with free refuel/rearm spots?  Or do I have to place all of the spots individually?
And for pathing, do units always go to the first path node? Can I put the AI anywhere along a loop and they will follow it?
Airbases come with refuel/rearm points in all the hangars and the landing pads

And for pathing, do units always go to the first path node? Can I put the AI anywhere along a loop and they will follow it?

The AI will start following the path at the closest point to where they spawn

i started making a mission on a workshop map, is it possible to convert it to MP? I can't load it after moving it i guess because I don't have unencrypted map files
okay I think I just needed to copy the map folder up a level
If a player is detected, are they always detected? Or can a player go back to undetected if they manage to evade sensors for sometime? can you hide from the AI i guess lol

If a player is detected, are they always detected? Or can a player go back to undetected if they manage to evade sensors for sometime? can you hide from the AI i guess lol
In the past, the answer was “yes”, but it’s become more nuanced with the rise of multiplayer and respawning
we can ignore respawns for the moment  I was making a mission where the objective is to capture multiple airbases, I've been forgiving with radar placement so that there is ways to the fields avoiding detection. I've got planes that launch when the player is detected and within in range, but I suppose after knocking the first field, the plane takeoff event will always fire I did try have a look see if I could do detected by [unit] but couldn't see it

Can you do repeatable missions?   I am thinking of an RTS style system where you have trucks go to a "resource location" and back to the base, providing some money each trip
s t o n k s
the answer is no, yukari from touhou project

CFTs push it up to what like 13k?
CFTs do refuel as its counted as "internal"
I want to say 20 000L

6400 + 4200 + 4200 + 4200 right?
wait no
I dunno

why is the AGM 89 more expensive than the AGM 161?
@ baha game breaking bug here
does the entire team have a budget in vtol?

does the entire team have a budget in vtol?
no lol
i want 4 a side competitive refueling

so whos making it? I will if no one will in 4 days exactly
how many refuel planes do we allow tho? one per team?
yes

how many refuel planes do we allow tho? one per team?
yes
161 technically has a TFR so its more advanced than a regular AGM but still not as complex as the 89

also do we do bedwars rules?
i will play this mission with you when its complete
wat

whats the min altitude for the tanker?
With what weapons
Lmao

@ierdna100 is the ASF carrier functional now?
can enemy player rearm on it
VTOL RTS also sounds great but I need to find a way to implement it  Resource obtaining workers  Ability to buy new units, like a mission with a -15000 reward that spawns a ground unit

any changes to be made?
1 u s d
no, perfect

Is hit by an AGM 89 a condition?
it could be
it is not

you can tell SAMs not to engage missiles right?
only in Unity
ah

can you sell starting fuel?
huh
I thought we could stop that

cant we just spawn them with very low fuel?
I assumed we could, never had a reason to
We could

Is there a respawn delay we could use?
noe
Make it more efficient by far to just fly to the tanker

Can you sell fuel in ext tanks?
only in CFTs
I think

how tf are you even going to die?
no more spawns
I guess running out of fuel but thats on you

(Much of discussion went into a group chat)  In any case, how can I give both sides equal carriers?
It seems allied and enemy have different carriers
Would be nice to be able to set a fuel consumption rate for a mission. Fuel is a useless mechanic since it never runs low in the course of a normal mission.

what about F/A-26B Naval Strike?
I'm not sure if I have done that one off the top of my head. I have done all the included missions tho
baha comms > tanker > call tanker to current position

Query of the day gents. If I had a Convoy of trucks, as a Objective, is there a way to take the waypoint location of the entire group? So, if one was killed, the way point would just shift to another in the group? Thanks as always.
just guessing, but you MIGHT be able to set a bunch of triggered events? start the waypoint on the first. if he's killed, set waypoint to 2nd one. dunno if it'll work if the 2nd one is killed, THEN the 1sts.
Not that I know of

ngl i kinda wish i could play the opfor jets

Can someone make a Ghost of Kyiv campaign?  I would make it but I don’t know how.
Too soon imo
Feels a bit disrespectful

you want to fly on this map?
lol wow the actual twin towers
fuck no

just gonna say how sick would it be to have a "ghost of kyiv" mission? first ace in the 21st century if the story is real.
first ace in a day since ww2
It's a bit early for that kind of stuff

is it wrong for wanting to get handed the vr stick to a drone in this conflict? sounds like some good irl fun without the conequence of dying.
seriously tho, imagine if a country produed so many drones that it could afford to just let random untraind citiens that have basic simulator experience, fly them from their home computers
talk about chaos

The fuck is wrong with you?
lmao sorry but id love to vr control an armed drone for ukraine rn
Russian, Ukrainian or whatever, these are real people with real lives

ok may i reinterperate drones as UAV's?
That's the same thing
"Global Hawk is a high-altitude, long-endurance, unmanned aerial reconnaissance system.” High-resolution sensors, including visible and infrared electro-optical systems and synthetic aperture radar, will conduct surveillance over an area of 40,000nm² to an altitude of 65,000ft"

soyou think when im talking ARMED DRONES that it isnt a combat aircraft?
An armed drone could be a DJI Mini 2 with a firework launcher attached to it
and if its armed i assume you dont give a fuck about rules

you realie iwe wouldnt be shootinging at people, just UAVs, right? lol
Maybe that’s what you are saying now, that’s not what you said
Maybe get to know some of the peoples who lives have been permanently destroyed or ruined due to the things they’ve witnessed or experienced and you’ll be a little more stable

Is there any way to set the event radius to be a plane or 0alt? I would like an event to trigger when the player lands to pick up some homies
use conditional trigger with 'player has landed' AND 'player inside x metres of waypoint' does that work, or i'm missing something
that works, thanks

Does the action "Destroy" remove a unit instantly or just set-it-on-fire destroy it?
the second one
Awesome, that's what I need

Is it possibly to develop missions using 2 different computers? I e working on on pc then picking up on a laptop when I’m away from the pc?
Yup. You'll need to work out some way to transfer the mission folder across
Possible? Sure. Giant pain in the ass? Yes.

Possible? Sure. Giant pain in the ass? Yes.
Thanks for the replies. I could end up damaging/corrupting  the mission files one way or the other that’s the risk I suppose.
Just create a copy or back up and put it in another folder.

Is the campaign file bigger than 100mb?
hey guys, I'm getting the issue of where the player spawns in with the gear up at the air base. Doesn't matter if its set to cold start or flight ready. anyone know how to fix this?
are you 100% sure they are on the ground?

I was almost certain

what do events do? compared to objectives
They can both cause Actions to happen. Events don’t have entries in the OBJ mfd page, and have varied triggering criteria. Never really thought about it this way tbh, but they’re pretty similar
Events are used to make stuff happen that’s not directly tied to an objective

I guess what I really want to know is, if I want to make aircraft spawn after I take off, can that be done with an objective?
Probably, but depending on the context, I’d possibly use a triggered event
alright

Can I just check (I'm an experienced mission editor prior to MP) to make a MP scenario, all I have to do is make it part of a multiplayer campaign and then in each scenario I need to create multiple "MP spawn" units for each side, nothing else unique to an MP scenario over a SP one, right?
The "player" object is largely useless now I assume; do I need to include it somewhere anyway or can I leave it out? And if I leave enemy MP spawn points out am I effectively creating a PvE (collaborative) mission or *must* I include them?
correct

except if you reference player in any conditional to replace it via multiple mp spawns you need for

Tell us about this function. How does ''AI SPAWNS'' function with respect to the player's spawn position? Also, is it possible to set a respawn position separate from the initial spawn position if, for example, the situation changes and the respawn position needs to be changed?
Huh, never seen that used for a player spawn before. Only with AI. I don't think player spawns can be changed mid-mission though, no. I haven't gone through all the options in the events though, so I might be wrong.
It is not possible to change the location of a spawnpoint mid-mission, but the alternate spawn feature allows you to assign a weight to multiple positions of the same spawn, so let's say you have 3 spawns in 3 locations over an airfield so the player never respawns at the same spot with the following settings:  ``` MP Spawn 1:   - Position 1, weight: 50   - Position 2, weight: 150   - Position 3, weight: 150 ```  The player is most likely to spawn at position 2 and 3, given the weight is the biggest (at 43% (150 / (150 + 150 + 50)) while he only has a chance of 14% to spawn at position 1

can you destroy  bridges?
No
I assume when you add the spawn points to a carrier that has alternative spawns, regardless of which it chooses, the spawns follow it?

I assume when you add the spawn points to a carrier that has alternative spawns, regardless of which it chooses, the spawns follow it?
I didn't test it yet, just curious if anyone has tried it
Quick question, if a trigger event fails a required objective, Will the mission fail completely?

Quick question, if a trigger event fails a required objective, Will the mission fail completely?
Yes.
I've seen missions that simulate it by placing things like storage tents or bunkers ON the bridge, or right at the legs. blow those up and you've blown up the bridge

if I fine tune a map, what will happen to the missions using that map? will it get updated?
Not unless you update them
There’s a Repack Map option in the mission editor menus

fine adjustments in some mountains wont crash the mission right?
Nope
mountains look very weird.. also some water edges are very squared

In the public testing branch: how do you create an AWACS for the red team?
I'm not seeing a way to spawn one in the editor.
You can do it by modifying the VTS file but im not sure if thats a good idea

that's what the dev did for the coop missions?
theres prob a reason its hidden in the editor
ok, thanks.

Does anyone know if i can make a mission today and later convert it to a multiplayer mission once we are able to make those? Or will i have to start all over again on release?
well you can make a mission and convert it into a multiplayer mission through the vts files.
Also we can already make multiplayer missions in public_test beta so you could just start off with a mp mission to begin with.

Is there an easier way to test mp missions than uploading, subscribing, leaving the editor, then hosting the game (possibly with a game reboot if the upload was an update)?
i dont think there is yet
make your mission in SP then when it works convert to MP

aight, so due to the need to upload to the workshop to test a mp mission, theres a lot of missions that are broken or WIP, anyone got a few reccomendations for co op MP missions?
if you want to test an mp mission sadly you have to upload it. but you can always unlist or private it.
How many pilots?

unrelated, anyone know how the "is detected" conditional works? im trying to have a bunch of fighters launch after the player is detected and i cant get them to work right
is it a problem with the condition or a problem with the launching? I tend to have trouble getting AI fighters to launch from the ground, so a lot of times I just spawn them right into the air if it's not right in front of the player
theyre launching from the ground and a carrier. i don't think its a problem with them launching but to trigger the event itself

its either launching them right at the very beiginning of the mission, or not at all

What methods are you using to detect the player? What's around that will see them?
i want it to literally just be any radar
do i need to specify which radars?

do i need to specify which radars?
shouldn't. are the radars on?
yup

shouldn't. are the radars on?
yup
hang on imma go fuck with it

Questions about AI fighters. ''PlayerCommands''. ・UnitGroupOnly ・ForceAllow ・ForceDisallow and ''DetectionMode'' settings, what actions are performed when they are set?
Player commands determines who responds to the player's wingman orders
DetectionMode determines who appears on the NAV map

ForceDetected is like the supply tents in the second (?) OpCobra mission
ForceDetected is the default for friendlies. ForceUndetected is the default for enemies
i swear to god i can never find that pilot

... I actually know what mission you're talking about (A/V-42 campaign) but who are you responding to?
oh i get it now
lost pilot

Is it possible to have an infinitely respawning group in the editor? Looking to make a range map for a couple of friends and would rather not restart the whole lobby every time we deplete the range.
sadly loops can't be used in the editor 😦
but you probably could copy and paste and group in the vts files and set them off using events.

did he set PLAYER spawns or MULTIPLAYER spawns?
they are different, lol
Is there a way to make ships in a sea group snap to their formation positions so they don't move on launch?

Is there a way to make ships in a sea group snap to their formation positions so they don't move on launch?
well you can always use actions to make them move to a path
They do move along a path, but because they don't spawn in perfect formation they have to move around a bit. It's not a functional problem, it just looks goofy

Well this raises the question: How do I exit a mission from the desktop?
you can press either the "del" or "end" key i forgot which one it was.

Why do some missions in the workshop require you to download the map as a separate mod? While others just include the map just fine?
the map is always baked into the mission
i guess its to credit whoever made the map

Am I being dumb or it is what it is?
You *could* have them all spawn and destroy excess units, but that only adds kills and doesn't change the total required amount
Alternatively, you could make the objective conditional and make your own logic

I am unable to test my MP mission that im working on, when I hit launch it says that I need to place a spawn point, but i have multiple MP spawn points placed already. Any one have an idea why it wouldn't be working?
MP missions can only be tested by publishing them to the workshop, subscribing, and then playing them
In other words: "Doing it live"

Is there a way to move the MP spawn during the mission? For example, after capturing an airfield, you can use it as a spawn point.
Nope.
you either need to centrally locate your spawn, or actually do a whole new mission

might be a dumb question but ive spawned in some units and they auto spawn as allies, cant seem to find the option to switch teams?
disregard i'm a dingus
You have to choose enemy units to spawn. it's a different tab

I recently had a hard drive failure. Is there any way I can edit the maps/missions I uploaded to the workshop?
not that i know of, iirc .vts files are encrypted
Drat! thanks

Can spawn points for multiplayer missions be disabled or moved?
What happens to spawn points on a carrier if it is sunk?
you can use alt spawns

hmmm i wonder, if you set the weight for an alt spawn to 0, and the regular spawn on the carrier, then destroy or delete the carrier, does that force all spawns to the alt spawn which is normally weighted 0? interesting.
might be an interesting workaround for the non-movable spawn points
You can't set alt-spawns for carriers apprerntly

Another Q for you guys; I take it there's no way of persisting data from one scenario in a campaign to the next? I'd like to make a campaign where repercussions of failures earlier on in the campaign might not necessarily FAIL the scenario, but will result in differences later on. For example, persistent loss of units - say you lose a support ship early on, that won't be there defending your fleet later on in the campaign. Is there currently any way to do this, or is it on a roadmap? That actually bring me on to another thought - do BD keep a feature/wishlist/roadmap published anywhere so I can not re-raise stuff that's already on their radar 😄 ?
sadly you cant do that but you can use money rewards.
Might see if I can work that into it, maybe so you can't afford certain aircraft. I forgot to mention, I'm thinking Multiplayer here - I've not seen the same campaign options for multiplayer (PvE/co-op). Is there a list of unit/weapon prices anywhere or have I got to go work it out myself 😄 😉

Okay, I think I’m doing this the right way. I want AWACS to take off and follow a path after a certain objective is completed.  I have the path set up and I set up a conditional trigger event that unit group Charlie which is AWACS will take off after the objective is complete.  How do I set it to take off and follow the path.  The trigger will make them take off and I have them all individually set to follow the path. Is that all that needs to be done or am I missing something?
I hope this mission is good 😅 this takes a lot longer than I thought
There is an takeoff order and followpath order

@Strikeeaglechase yo you home yet?
Is there a way to move MP spawns during the course of a mission?
Like, if I have alternate spawns on a carrier and an airbase, will sinking the carrier or changing the airbase faction disable those spawns?

i had a bug after i added alt spawn points... ive tried this: regular spawn cold at hangar, first alt spawn holding short of runway flight ready, and second alt spawn in flight AP... but 2 problems ocurred in my tests.. 1. always spawn at regular spawn. 2. it spawns with gears retracted (cold but like if it was on flight)

How do I make a mission for multiplayer training?  Do I just make a normal mission with multiple player spawns?
Oh I see, it's an option for campaign only
Just make a campaign with 1 mission. :P

and how was that? did he beat it?

if so how, I know i'm telling it to move right, since I do the exact same thing to make the carrier move in stable, but it sits put in public testing
i did same way

Any ideas why it has no effect?
Is the boat spawned at the start of the level?
you might have to call the event sequence via an objective

Also the "is not" "alive" trigger has always been very fucky for me. I don't use it anymore.  What i do instead is use the NumAlive trigger and set it for "less than" "1". Equals 0 is also sometimes not reliable.  You may have to use UnitList instead of Unit.

Wait what type of event is that?
sequence
says at the top

Do you mean I should set an objective "kill the boat", and it should trigger the SetEngage stat?
No
You should enable trigger on start for the event sequence

Oh fuck, that's what that "start immediately" checkbox does?
It starts it as the mission loads
given you already have a condition on the first box

Alright, thanks! I don't get the checkbox tho - how would the sequence trigger if I don't have the box checked?
You'd have another event that starts this Sequence Event
it never runs anything in it until it receives an external signal to do it (system -> run event)

Have you set it to engage enemies?
Oh I didn't, but now it is - let's try that
Does the MAD4 radar just suck (or have a high min altitude?)  I literally flew over it before it got a lock on me, no terrain in the way

Does the MAD4 radar just suck (or have a high min altitude?)  I literally flew over it before it got a lock on me, no terrain in the way
It got a lock on me and then lost it a few seconds later
it has a minimum range

What is the expected range of the radar itself getting a lock on you?
depends on the aircraft you're in and what's your aspect to it. Your Radar Cross-Section (RCS) determines if the radar will get enough bounce back to detect you
Oh yeah I was flying nose-on in a clean 45

How do I 'join' conditions and logic nodes in the conditional editor? Apologies if I am missing something really obvious but tried every mouse button etc hovering over orange nodes and can't connect them.
like a sequence or like an IF, Else statment?
Sorry just sorted it by clicking on the arrow symbol - I'm trying to work out how to force the mission being failed if the player dies e.g. no respawns allowed. Think I can use conditional objective?

Team A Deaths equals 1

can you just do an event?
Thank you for the screen shot 👍 clicking the arrow seems to be hit and miss for me to join the nodes - no longer working...
You could, but there's already a failure condition option in all the objectives afaik

why make the extra event if you could just do it in the objectives? well I guess if you have a ton of objectives and don't want to set failure for them all
though you'll still have to set the event to fail each objective individually. less work than dealing with the visual scripting
Clicking on the arrow in any condition box in the conditional editor  to get the join line isn't working consistently for me  - is it a known  bug in public branch editor?

Don't think so, I didn't have any problems when I made my stupid AH-94 mission in the public beta
OK thanks - just quitted and restarted and it worked - I'll do that in future as a fix.

As you where speaking about no respawns allowed... How do I do limited respawns.. i didnt figure out how to count deathes.. is it in MP stats node?
I still don't Undestand the usage of sequences.. but probably using this would fix my issues of triggering the wrong events hehe
I haven't specifically looked into it, but the game itself tracks deaths, so you can just fail objectives once Team A has reached 5 deaths for instance. AAS uses a ticket system where you can actually gain more respawn tickets when you capture sectors, so I'm *guessing* that the target number for failure is actually a global variable, and successful sector captures adds 5 to that variable.

U know anything about alt spawns?
Cuz im having some weird stuff happening
I use them sometimes

Set up 3 alt spawn with 100 weight, should be equal chances for all of them right? 1 at ground cold 2 at ground flightready 3 airborne  But it always spawns at 1, cold, but no brakes, no gear, kind if it was in flight.
yeah weight isn't done using 100% the best example i can give is, if you are trying to make a 50/50 chance of spawn you would have to put them both at 100
is this player spawns?

If I put some vehicles into a group they will no longer follow a path and just sit there. Is this supposed to happen?
Are you commanding the individual vehicles to move or the group itself?
I believe if you group them together then you have to command the entire group

Ok, where do you tell the group to do something? I see the group window and it shows the units in the group

Ok, where do you tell the group to do something? I see the group window and it shows the units in the group
Units in a group will mindlessly do what the group leader does
Who is the group leader?

Who is the group leader?
If the group leader starts moving, they’ll form up on him, then follow in formation
It’s the first unit to be added to the group

what does the "follow" behaviour for units actually do?
Id guess its for making things like wingmen or other planes follow another unit or the player
It would be funny to set a sam to just follow the player all over the map. Just set it as invincible, itd be like the slow unrelenting monster in a horror movie

Limited my spawned f45's in mp to mk83 and guns - set a helipad (vtol start and finish) and attached refuel/rearm unit to each helipad. But it won't allow rearm/refuel - says it is unavailable. Can't you rearm in game once out of briefing room if you limit loadout? Any tips on how to limit loadout but still enable ground refuel of limited weapons appreciated
If you don't allow configuration, then I'm pretty sure rearm isn't allowed
Allow configuration, but each spawn point you can set the allowed weapons in the configuration

Thanks for the response - I'm limiting the loadout per spawn point as you suggest - can't find an option to allow configuration though - all I'm doing is picking mk83 and guns by checking boxes in mp  spawn unit options. Apologies if I am missing an obvious tick box somewhere?
Scenario Info
Edit -> Scenario Info

how can I convert a map to multiplayer? for PvP ?
If its a map then run the public testing version of vtol and start a new campaign - select your map and tick multiplayer option. If its a scenario not a map I think you convert /import but that has not gone well for me. If just your map then set up allies and enemy player mp spawn points using units. I'm still learning the editor so others might have better tips/advice.
OK that might work. I could not place the enemy player in the map editor and I am not finished putting strategic units in place but wanted to test the map with another player to get a feel for the size and scope of the battle field.

How can I create multiplayer missions ?
I found it !
:q_pepedriving:

Any idea in how to implement limited spawns?
ive been thinking for an hour and couldn't figure this
yeh i know, MP Status counts deaths.. but how do i use that..

just a trigger? if mp stats death > X ?
if(teamDeats > x) { fail mission }
why i thought this wouldn't work?  whole mission is base on this logic hahaha, why would it be different? man, i'm so dumb

You were right - started from scratch and the refuel/rearm worked thank you 👍

Can't get infantry - single or group - to follow a path in mp  editor - do I need to in use way points for infantry units?  - just wanted them to patrol around a base in the desert - but setting them to path then selecting a path doesn't work. Clean start with mp mission in public test branch.
send a picture of the setup
Thank you - will do tomorrow just not on my pc now 👍 + how do you attach a picture!

Have two issues if anyone can help please.  1. Found in mp campaign editor  screen that if you just change the campaign description text and nothing else after pressing save and exiting it won't save the description text change. If anyone can check this is the case for them what # do I report it to the dev... Unless it's a known issue in public test branch editor?
2. Edit - Solved. If I use F12 in campaign editor screens I get a pop up bottom  right to say Vtol screen shot saved - but it doesnt appear in the screenshot folder in steam apps / vtol e.t.c.... I am using the desktop 2D version of the editor - is this a known issue or does anyone know how to fix please.
Pressing F12 directs Steam to take a screenshot

how *do* you make MP missions? Do you have to do it via the MP mod or is there something in the base game?
Be on the public test beta branch, create a multiplayer campaign. Create missions in that multiplayer campaign
I can't find a way to get the editor to save changes to the main campaign description and name - it will upload changes to steam workshop but then in the editor when I go back in its reverted to the original desc and name I put in when I first created the campaign - anyone else have that issue / know if it's a known bug?

Try making a timed event that starts 1 second late and assings the units to move along the path
I cant see anything wrong from here

Have you ever had any issues with saving changes to mp campaign description / and or name. Save goes green then greyed when clicked on and changes upload to steam wkshop but when I reload campaign the desc and title have reverted to the very first text I put in when setting up the campaign originally..... is this a known issue?
No
OK thank you - I'll try a new test  campaign and see if I get the same thing.

thank you! will my friends have to opt in to the public beta to be able to play the mission?
yup
dunno if im being mega dense here, do you opt into the public beta on steam? i've done that but it doesnt seem to have changed anything in the editor, i dont see any MP options

You right click on the vtol logo click on properties and go into betas and you should find a selection menu for all the different versions.

public unstable build testing? is that the one?
Yes
It should be the top one.

you cant just do scenarios then? has to be via the campaign menu?
It has to be in a campaign
The campaign can have just one mission, and the missions it contains don't have to be related at all

and im getting from some of the previous posts in here if you've started making a mission in SP it doesnt convert over very well to MP?
I'm not even sure if there's an in-game way to do it tbh. Hand editing the files is inherently sketchy
Also save your description somewhere and be prepared to change it every time you update the mission/campaign

Since loops aren't available yet, has anyone created a tool to automate cloning triggers?
uhh no but you could do it yourself
not directly, but you can edit the VTS file or convert it to JSON then edit it there

Has Baha confirmed if looping triggers will ever be added?
He hasn't said its planned
but also hasn't said itll never come so we cna have hope

See if what's possible? Looping? As far as I can tell a trigger will only ever resolve once.

Gah you've already done so much here. I've been putting off learning JS/TS and writing webapps for way too long. Might as well throw myself into it. You know of any good tutorials for an otherwise experienced programmer?
Uhhh not sure to be honest, I picked up JS as my first language so I don't know a lot about how to jump into it from an already experienced perspective
I could probably write a python version in a little bit

what are you trying to do?
chase jumping from the high language to the even higher language
Currently, custom missions do not support looping/repeatable triggers. Once a trigger fires once, it will never ever fire again. The workaround is to clone the trigger, making as many copies of it as could be reasonably fired during a single playthrough. I want to make a mod that adds a "Copies" counter to the conditional trigger UI so it saves that many copies of the trigger in the VTS file instead of just one.

what kind of trigger actions are you trying to loop?
The first one off the top of my head is to spawn hostile craft every time a player spawns.
units can only be spawned once though

I don't play with the mission editor a lot but maybe you could add an event to revive/repair a unit? That way you can reuse it without needing to mess with spawning more ones each time
Shoot down some targets, then hide them, repair them, and teleport them back to their starting location in a loop
No way to resurrect or repair destroyed units that I know

i'm pretty sure it's already been askep a lot but what the hell 🙂 : Do we have any insight on when it will be possible to implement comuniy missions/maps/campaings in multiplayer?
It already is on the public testing branch. It'll be pushed to the main branch when it's working well

I'm trying to create a multiplayer campaign. I changed to the Public Test branch, I verified the game files. I'm not seeing the Multiplayer checkbox you were talking about. Am I looking in the wrong place?
You're not on the public test branch
this one, right?

will "force undetected" work against AI?
i.e. if i set a friendly unit to "force undetected" enemies wont detect/engage
or do i need to add non-targets for the enemies

Is there a way to play an audio file specifically to one or more players in mp - eg two planes from a 6 plane flight wander into a proximity area and only they hear the audio track? Just thinking about mp user specific messages - so alpha 1-2 for instance flys into a proximity area on their own and rather than triggering a generic msg everyone hears only they hear 'you are in the vicinity of the enemy base e.t.c.' as that message would be confusing to the rest of the mp flight.
@besp09 I don't think there's one for a certain player for the jets but there is one for a specific team and if the player is in the helo.  I checked for the same thing awhile ago.
@besp09 Should be "Radio Message Team" and "Copilot Radio Message" in the Event Action Browser.

Is there a max amount of missions you can add to a campaign?
i don't think so but the max would probably be the amount of storage it takes up.
Ah okey! And what about max amount of objectives in a single mission? If there is one?

Ah okey! And what about max amount of objectives in a single mission? If there is one?
well i would doubt that as well
i find briefing images take up the most storage.

Also does baha blast make all the missions in the multiplayer?
like on the workshop?
No for the like pre made missions for the not public testing missions

Also has there been any chances for missions that a person has made to be added to the game? Like a competition or something?
That sounds fun tbh
Likie best overall missions might get added

Does Force Undetected mean that a unit can't be detected?
no, it just means it s not showing on navmap at the beginning , useful to hide ally on start, like missing para
Is there a way to swap units teams mid game I think it would be cool for AV's to drop troops to "capture an airfield" and then 1 team could land and resupply

Does anyone know if there is a unit cap or not?
Well you could test
I dont think there is a limit per se but your framerate will begin to suffer at some point. Where that point is is depends on your PC.

Hmm... I set an objective checked as start immediatly and use the 'start event' to send wpt to gps.. but gps shows nothing when in game... Was this supposed to happen?
Another question as you were talking about unit cap... not spawned units will affect fps?
not really

Another question as you were talking about unit cap... not spawned units will affect fps?
not really
there's like 3 servers

Did you set the waypoint in the event? I don't think it will send the objective's waypoint, you have to tell the event what waypoint you want (which can be the objective's, but you need to set it manually)
There's like 10 at peak times
Plus you could like get friends

Has this ever been answered? I also would like to know if you can reorder the events by dragging them around or something other than going into text file.
I suspect the answer is "no"
Props for using the search functionality, though

Is this a multiplayer mission or something?
Yes editor event > send to GPS doesnt work in mp AFAIK
can confirm did not work in mp

Even if you’re spawned and flying around?
yeah, but that was before the last update
What's the easiest way to make tanks patrol a city?

What's the easiest way to make tanks patrol a city?
Make a path through the city, tell the tanks to follow the path
Make sure to shove them all in the same group

The path has to follow the roads, right? Should I put the nodes in intersections?
it does not
The tanks can go up 90 degree slopes

Mod please pin this? @Shadowtail?
Turn off the equipment selection through the mission info and open insert cam.
this is already pinned somewhere

Also, is there a trick to spawn a group of units with alt-spawns together?
Like, if I want a full squad of tanks to spawn in 1 of 4 possible locations
If I just give them all alt spawns I assume they will be separated

I don't quite understand the reason for Entry *and* Exit conditions in Event Sequences. Shouldn't it just be a single "Continue" condition to advance to the next sequence node?
you have a delay at the begining of each node
after the delay the condition is check. So you for example exit condition, unit is dead, then wait 20 sec before going to next node.

What's the difference between adding an exit condition to Node 1, vs adding it as an entry condition to Node 2?
realization
Let say, you want to play a radio after the last tank is dead, then complete the objective once the radio is completed.

Maybe it's just because I'm looking at this from a programmer perspective? I already understand how to use a state machine intuitively.
Again, every entry condition can be substituted by adding empty node above with an exit condition
but its more click doing so :p

Hey this has probably already been asked but why are my bases are roads being erased when I load the map in missions editor?
Did you manually copy the map and rename the folder without renaming the .vtm file inside?
No I just saved it in game

Did you manually copy the map and rename the folder without renaming the .vtm file inside?
No I just saved it in game
I’ve tried twice and the bases keep getting deleted

Did you change the map after you originally created the mission?
No I’ve made new missions each time
odd

Specifically on one map or did you try more?
I’ll try another
Height and city changes are saved to the .png files, which have static names. Bases and roads are saved to the .vtm file, which has a dynamic name. This is why I think it's a problem with the .vtm file.

Do you have any antivirus software running?
No
This is a bit out of scope

I think I know how to make a specific tank or group of tanks patrol a city following a path, but what's the best way to have many units patrol separately? Can I have units start at different points within the path? Do I have to create a separate path for each separate patrol?
Units will start following a path at the point closest to them
Oh, that's perfect

just to make sure, not spawned units are accounted as 'not alive' in conditionals right?
Units are alive until they're killed
Unspawned units are thus alive

if more than 3 players AND those units destroyed? 😛
why i can't think without writing it here. i feel so dumb every time haha
talking out problems is the greatest way to solve them sometimes

omg youre about to show me something that will change my life?
WOW
it's a bit of a joke/meme, but at the same time there's a truth to it

that should cover both cases.. right?
oh, last node is wrong
imagine as num alive equal 0

Do I need to speak or read portuguese? XP
otherwise yeah I'm happy to help test

How do you change the missile type on the launcher?
When looking in the launcher's settings there is a tab for equips just like air units
It was hiding from me for the longest time

What's the maximum reasonable altitude to have an enemy AEW-50 AWACS orbit at?
> BSM-66 - "Standard radar-guided missile." The standard Surface-to-Air Missile. Attempts to intercept the target, dealing major damage on impact. >  > BSM-66LR - "Standard radar-guided missile. Equipped with [a] first-stage booster for extended range." A regular SAM missile with an extra booster stage, giving it much longer range and making it harder to outrun or outmaneuver. >  > FLKM-100 - "Dual stage long range radar-guided missile that deploys a field of explosive munitions." Essentially a BSM-66LR that functions as an aerial cluster bomb. Intercepts the target and deploys a small field of cluster bomblets in front of them. The spread-out damage makes it excellent for dealing with bandits in close formation. from the wiki
30k, 40 at the very most

I think you're off by exactly one order of magnitude there. I assume the original poster meant 32,800 ft?
meters are bigger than feet, so the number for meters should never be bigger than the number for feet
Ahh, the power of editing. Sneeky breeky

All the fixed wings are 40k right?
Heli is like 12 somthin
I think the 42 default is 30-35

What's to prevent the AH-94s from just lobbing AGM-145s over the mountain to LOAL? Or are you just restricting their weapons to prevent that?
I remember for a time there was a hard limit to the game at 40k ft
Was it not 10000m?

yeah, you could just ban them. feels like a cop-out though, y'know? A heavy-handed way of escaping poor mission design
Ehh, at least for the AH94 banning 145s is a great way to add a bit more challenge
True. 145s OP

Speaking of, anyone have a writeup of good mission design? (Or bad things to avoid?)
Most effective Sam on my first mission was a launcher tucked deep as you say with 3 radar on the crest... Great idea about triggering support radars
RWR just *lights up.* "Oh.... fuck."

....why couldn't I just spawn 30nm closer if literally nothing happens and there's no threat in the first 30nm?
same with making objectives really far apart, with nothing interesting or challenging in between for huge stretches
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2569449610

also, you can make checkpoints make quicksaves in missions right?
why does noone do that
you can also limit the number of quicksaves in a mission. I found that out the hard way

to prevent quicksave spamming? The RPG player trope of quicksave after every 10 steps, every item picked up, every enemy killed
tho quicksaves sorta buggy now anyways, so..... probably better to not rely on them
Maintain your weapons and they will rarely, if ever, jam.

so I can go past 196km?
Yes
O-O

is it a things where you just have to edit the file?
Yes
ah

do you happen to know how that effects performance?
It's bad if you add a lot of things to it, same as normal missions
the terrain itself doens't seem to lag the game the bigger it is, but he didn't go *too* big

To play devil's advocate, what would you think of a game like Euro Truck Simulator where the majority of the gameplay *is* realistically driving a truck across Europe for hours at a time?

That's relatively niche gaming though. While some people find it fun, most don't. We're talking about general principles here. Like ArmA is generally pretty realistic, but it's too much so for most people. Designing for simmers is different from designing for the general gaming population.

Like, a realistic mission would be jet transfer. Make a huge map. Take off from one corner. Fly straight line to the other corner. Land. Mission complete. Would some people find that fun? There's probably a few. The vast majority wouldn't.
Unless you are catering to a specific crowd, a lot of "realistic" bits can be trimmed off to make a mission more enjoyable for a greater number of people
Well you've kind of answered your own dilemma; the people who like that kind of mission will play that mission, and the ones who don't won't

Oh dang, this goes all the way back to that?
Yep.
Ahh, but what I was talking about was the inclusion of a 40nm flight to an objective for no reason. What would otherwise be, say, a straightforward strike mission that includes a massive long flight for no reason other than... "realism." Trim that flight out, it's unnecessary and makes the mission more tedious for most people

would it really be a mission then if the objectives are right outside of spawn?
sounds more like target practice idk
lol

And a lengthy flight could also be fine *if it has a purpose* like evading heavy air defense by requiring low terrain flying. Then the pilot is doing *something* right?
but there's also long missions like killbox or falklands where it takes a bit to get to objectives
both are really fun

Is there a way to view global values in mission?
mod
otherwise, no

Im looking for player controllable chopper... can I not have mixed playable vehicles in amission ?
Is it a singleplayer or multiplayer mission?
multi

Is it a singleplayer or multiplayer mission?
multi
well im makinag it for multi, i just literally opened mission editor and added a carrier and fa-26b's to it.. and wanting to add the attack chopper also

ok i think i may have figured it, do i need to put player spawn poinst down instead of the actual aircraft? and by that means, will the mission only have 1 playable type of aircraft?
ok i really dont understand how this thing works
depends on objectives and enemy types, whether you want to start detected etc.  if you're bombing a location and the only threat is a short range/IR sams then a bit of a  waste of time  jets get away with it a bit, once you're up you travel a lot of distance quite fast, helo not so much  also annoying when a ah94 workshop mission insists on you climbing a 15000ft mountain

Can a unit be destroyed before being spawned?
good question
yes

After Editing a map and making a mission how do i start to fly with it "?
where do i load the mission ?
for SP; custom scenario ; for MP it need to be on the workshop and subscribed

Can the ASF-58 AI dogfight effectively with radar off?
no, its visual range is like nothing
but it has a RWR now at least

But it doesn't behave like an F-45 able to fire BVR purely by RWR and datalink?
no
AI cant do that party trick

i put it in the folder and it does not apper in the game ?
what im doing worng ?
You shouldn't have moved it anywhere?

i made a map and mission editor
and i saved it in the D:\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios , but when i go in the Game it does not appear , anything else i need to do ?

and i saved it in the D:\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios , but when i go in the Game it does not appear , anything else i need to do ?
When you save a scenario, it’ll automatically appear in your custom scenarios
It doesn't show in the Vehicle mission list menu > custom scenario?

It doesn't show in the Vehicle mission list menu > custom scenario?
You don’t need to futz around moving stuff
so i save it and it does not apper

You’re in the correct menu for the plane you set the mission to use?
in the mission editor i just placed a Player object
isnt it enough ?

so can it be done from files ?
not from in game ?
Can what be done?

not from in game ?
Can what be done?
change the player arcraft to b26

Probably, but I’ve no idea how. What’s stopping you doing it in game?
i open the vts file
im not a 3d person more of a programmer lol

how do i do it in game , thanks ?
The files aren't designed to be edited by hand, it's not really possible to make a scenario from just the text file
whel

why game version is 1.3.2 tho?
i play ofline
thats the game version that the mission was created in iirc

game is currently in 1.3.5 no? oh old version.
Where can i find the f16 Mod ?
its not publicly available

Is there anyway to give artillery trucks a point to fire at?
in actions you can give a location to fire at i think
All I see is ripple rate and shots per salvo

Hey, is the multiplayer editor in the public testing build of the game? Trying to figure out how you'd add multiple player slots.
Oh I see
I have to start a campaign, it can't be a standalone mission.

Oh hey, it's Rimmy, lol. So you did read my youtube comment (maybe?). XD Looking forward to seeing what craziness y'all get up to
No longer true! You can launch a test from the editor now, but it will be a private game that no one can join (since it's not on the workshop yet)
OMG this is awesome

SAM Launcher doesn't need *any* line of sight on the target, right? Only the radar it's linked to.
correct
Would be cool to have transport vehicles like an LMTV in addition to all the other ground vehicles to be able to create  convoys or pose as support vehicles should there be a need for them in creating a mission.

This Russian convoy satellite images making you hungry?
Very much so lol
Hey guys, how do i convert a singleplayer campaign to MP?

Hey guys, how do i convert a singleplayer campaign to MP?
I think all you have to do is switch to the public testing branch, click edit your campaign then you should see a box to click that says 'MP Campaign' before you select a mission to edit. That will make it a multiplayer campaign, and then you just drop in 'MP spawn units'  in to your missions in that campaign.   From what i understand you cannot make multiplayer one off missions yet. They have to be housed in a multiplayer enabled campaign.
Cool, thanks! I'll try to do that.

With the developer camera up, pressing Tab allows me to shoot a machine gun with left click. Don't suppose anyone knows of a way to drop bombs from the developer camera?
no you cant
I havent even attempted to check this my self, but do AI wingmen work in MP?

I havent even attempted to check this my self, but do AI wingmen work in MP?
They can certainly exist and follow scripting, but I don't think they can be given orders.
And they can't be grouped with the players afaik because players can't be assigned to a flight group

@L etranger or anyone else, I'm preparing to release my first custom mission. It has many triggers and complicated mechanics. I've thoroughly tested it in SP to ensure it's stable, and I'm about to covert it to MP. Anything specific you recommend testing after converting a mission to MP?
make sure the players have enough time to fuck around before the missions starts, so everyone joins and takes-off, regroups and whatnot
So like, don't start triggering time based stuff too quick into the mission?

So like, don't start triggering time based stuff too quick into the mission?
Basically, yes
And time-based events in general, try to let the players go at their own pace, MP might take longer than normal missions because people are like that

What's the best way to delay a "mission start" radio message until everyone has spawned in?
I tried making it on a 5sec delay but by the time I spawn in it's already done
I usually use a 7sec delay rules

*unrelated question: do you work in the communications industry?*
Unrelated question, if the mission fails do all triggers just stop working?
Or events in general

Unrelated question, if the mission fails do all triggers just stop working?
Or events in general
You mean objectives?

no.. strange question, why ? 😄
7 seconds is usually the delay between a live broadcast and what the client receives
This is probably my fault because I don't really make missions but I accidentally made the mission fail and almost immediately all of my hidden groups spawned in

Possibly related to the potential race condition I've noticed? https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/957356092000722964
Put a 1sec delay between the spawn action the "go here" actions
@Sypwn  there isn't much you can do. MP should work out of the boxes. If you tested properly all condition in SP it should be good. Make sure tho if you reference player in condition to change the ref to mp_spawn_1 or mp_spawn_2 etc

Also unrelated question, what is a good way to tell if storage tents have been blown up? I went with a really wonky: ``` if(storagetent1.isNotAlive)                                 AND if(storagetent2.isNotAlive)          AND if(storagetent3.isNotAlive)                                AND if(storagetent4.isNotAlive)                 OR    failthemission          if(storagetent5.isNotAlive)                                 AND if(storagetent6.isNotAlive)          AND if(storagetent7.isNotAlive)                                AND if(storagetent8.isNotAlive) ```
Thanks. I kept the MP spawns in the entire time as AI units, and I'm swapping them back to MultiplayerSpawn in the vts
and I don't think it worked well

There's an option to just read from the list of storage tents?
:waa:
same to easily have a no enemy near a waypoint  (Secure area) unit list > not any near waypoint. for AAS, I just use a 15Km radius waypoint, select all units, unselect players, and just wait for not any near waypoint to valid the obj.

can I shadow moment you?
I found a junky solution to make a 1 life per slot dynamic mission.
I thought about it deeply one day and keep wondering, how would a script work in this case?  Let's say JSON to assign properties, or whatever, the current property menu is fine.  For triggers though?

more like an interface to use code action.

Any simple way to get a higher resolution picture of a map than the 512x512 preview image? The loading screen has the "VTeditor" in the middle and the minimap has gridlines.

Regarding multiplayer campaign editor. Is it a known issue that you can only spawn in the av-42c when attempting to launch the scenario from the editor or something?
How do you add multiple players to a mission in the mission editor?
Selected player aircraft as ah-94 for both player mp spawns launched scenario from mission editor In the slot and equipment selection scene I still showed ah-94 options, and even could select equipment for them there (though I just left the equipment what is had by default for me) spawned in in with a av-42c with no equipment ejected a couple times and still only got the av-42c went back to mission editor, and my MP spawn points had reverted to av-42c (maybe I forgot to save) after setting them to ah-94 again and saving everything worked as normal  Still odd that the slot selector showed ah-94 and it's equips the first time, despite spawning me in the av-42c

Does anyone know if there is a way for an AI AV - 42c to drop off troops? And if so how?
There is, yes. I've definitely done it in a mission, had an AV-42 that spawned with troops drop them off, and that completed an objective. It's one of the action events available
Thank you so much

Anyone got the list of dev controls for mission testing?
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor
Wait it has been deleted.

Hi , after creating a map and a mission that is not a training one  when i choose the aircraft i don't have any missiles to attach ; anyone knows why ?
You need to permit equips. If it's a singleplayer mission, that's done in the scenario options. If it's a multiplayer mission, it's done on the player spawner entity
how do i spawn players for coop scenario

is there a shortcut to make the hud invisible so i can take a screenshot?
btw, can ai fighter jets form up on the attack helicopter?
I couldn't find one so I just ended up using Windows Snipping Tool to get images from the editor.

Is there a way to duplicate missions in a campaign so I don't have to remake the entire mission for a pt2?
the is a "save as" option.
Ah ok

did you try and save and then it froze?
it has not froze
seems like a ui bug

wait has the file been corrupted?
no
okay good

is there a way to add subtitles in the mission editor yet?
You can sorta do it by using the tutorial message function
that will display text over the pilot's view

Any way to track how many saves a player makes within a mission? I know how to limit or turn off, just want to update a global value on save amounts for a sort of scoring system
hey, im pretty new to the editor and was wondering if there is a way to select multiple units at once? thanks!
Sadly. No.

Whats the bullseye in the scenario info?
its a reference point on the map people can make callouts in reference to
Okey thx

Is there a way to create a custom mission with the editor that is using the quickstart map? Can't seems to find it in the available maps ...
What's the quickstart map?
if you mean the freeflight 2 map, or the f45 freeflight maps, i dont think those are included with the game

hey guys, is there a way to respawn killed Units with a trigger?
a new trigger with a spawn action dosent semm to do the trick
Nope, gotta spawn whole different set of units, sadly.

Dosent that slow down the mission though?
might be easier to copy 'em by opening the .vts in notepad and just doing a copy-paste and then edit some names
I dunno why it's that way, it just is that way, lol

does it work with mp though?
Yup
oof

Has anyone been able to figure out how to get the ground units to spawn? I made the waypoints like the guide says and none of them spawn. Also enemy air planes just spawn immediately right on front of me and serve me like a Chick-fil-A drive thru
quick question
is this meters, kilometers or nautical miles?

is this meters, kilometers or nautical miles?
its fine, I'll wait until you maybe update it ^^. Its just such a nice addition to have endless waves, its as close to arma/dcs liberation as we can get so far so im excited to see your mod updated 🙂
Afaik meters

Am I right in thinking there is no way to revive destroyed units?
There is not.
Thanks

I can get an npc to taxi out to the runway with a path and then give him the takeoff command. But later, I can't get him to follow a taxi path after giving him the land command. He always follows his own route to the same hanger. Is it not possible after land command to prevent him from continuing his predefined taxi route?
Plane on ground can be finicky, I personnaly avoid any micro management at all. Execpt Take Off/Land, follow path in air.
Hello, I am trying to make a mission now that workshop multiplayer is public, but it is only letting me create one player spawnpoint

Also, what happens if I have more MP spawn points than seats in the briefing room?

Timed events. I've set a timed event not to start immediatly. then i have a triger event to 'begin' the timed event. Timed event never initiate. Why? haha
Have to see how you set it up to be able to tell you
No way we can know without seeing it

can you open the mission editor/vtol without opening/plugging in your vr headset?
yes
how would you go about it? I know you can launch your game but dont you get stuck waiting to press ready while in the carrier atc?

So, when placing a drone carrier, is there any way to edit the on-board manta's weapon loadout?
Nope
They just spawn with the double machineguns

Did the debug camera change to remove the gun option or am I just not finding the right guide?
ok i see
I hear a rumour it's not available when doing multiplayer testing

how do you add spawnpoints to carriers?
click on the carrier, and click the button label "edit spawns" or something
i dont remember the exact name

hey i'm struggling to get the helicopter to work, it always only has a pilot slot. Anyone know how to fix this?
what should I press here to enable the second seat to work?
"allowed slots" to 2

if the carrier is parked
and nothing moves

how good is the manta ucav in combat?
i have a drone carrier and i don't want to overwhelm the players
They are not that great

what is a reasonable amount of aircraft to throw at the players?
6 per player running a2a would be reasonable/easy
Naval strike has something akin to 30

what dose reload time mean on sam launchers?
like after it fires one missile or all 4
all 4

do ships attack each other at close ranges?
if they have an antiship VLS
carriers dont

Can you disable the orange team if you just want PVE?
Rocket boats will *crush* ships lol
Yup, just don't put any spawns in.

how do I fail a mission if a unit is destroyed or players go to a certain area?
is the win decided if a team completes all its objectives?
😭

is the win decided if a team completes all its objectives?

If you set an objective as required and that objective is failed, the mission will fail

can someone send me good missions with the ah 94 heli?
files of the mission
You can't get them off the workshop?

You can't get them off the workshop?
I think they want the unencrypted mission editor files
yea do you have any?

yea do you have any?
or do you know where i can get some
Now I'm kinda curious why you want them

how do you make a naval fleet move to a waypoint in formation?
if someone can send me some i would be grateful
so please

so no one has any missions?
Just download them from the steam workshop it's really easy
Will that work also if you give a path to the first unit in a group?

then what does it do

so if i put force undetected it will never ever show up on the navigation but it will on the radar?
Again, no 😛
.O.

Have you played the built-in campaigns?
bearly
There’s a mission in the AV-42 one where you have to find a lost allied pilot

did you make that mission?
yes
fuck you

did you do it alone?
no there was other people
i made it to be up for hours

to refuel off the apache?
to refuel the ah-94
oh

what, the rotor disk tilt?
so you fly up
also, that 105 PIO

do *"Team A"* and *"Team B"* refer to the Allied and Enemy teams respectively?
Yes
If you put a helicopter MPspawn point down in a multiplayer campaign mission, does that prevent players who don't have the DLC from playing in that mission? Even if you have other non dlc aircraft MPspawns available to fly in that mission?

nice!

Quick question. Apologies if this has been covered although I couldn't see it? I have created an AH-94 Multiplayer campaign by converting an existing single player campaign. Is there anything I need to do in relation to settings within the editor to accommodate other players aircraft being able to spawn in or for two people to occupy one aircraft? I am quite experienced with the single player version of the mission editor but have not used the multiplayer functionality at all so i'm looking for some advice?
I have no idea for the Helo. The player spawn aircraft are just in the units for mp campaign editors
Probably adds two seats in the menu if you select an AH-94

how do you add players to team b?
unrelated, capture the AWACS
you get like, 3 awacs's's's's's's per team

Can anyone advise the most effective way to set up no respawns in a mp game please for x1 helo set to 2 seats. @Thenlar i think you must have done this for your island AH94 mission? Thanks.
The Enemy Team gets so many cool sea troops while team A gets an assault carrier Aircraft Carrier and Cruiser i wonder why
I set a failure condition on every single objective. "If Team A Deaths = 1"

Can someone explain to me how to convert a single player mission into a multiplayer one? I think I did it, but I dont know
It has it listed as a separate mission in the workshop
need to be a campaign first

like, edit in the mission editor or in notepad?
in mission editor for the spawn
I do all my mission in SP coz I can skip the helmet, disable configuration screen; play in accelerated and kill any unit (without using my headset). When the flow is good I convet and add the mp spawn

Would it still show up separately on the workshop from the SP version?
Yes it will be a campaign
Got it

Which flavour of Sam site?
How do I command the enemy artillery to shoot a specific target such as an allied tank or a refueling base?
nvm i figured it out

ah
that may be it

I'm needing some help with a scenario I made, in the mission editor I have about 7 enemies that are coming towards our air base but when I try to host the scenario all the enemies are gone and the mission says complete, what's going on?
do you have any logic errors like events.
also what are your objectives

is there any way we could jump into a call and you could help explain this to me?
Are the enemies spawning and pathing in a sensible way? Are they spawning underground, or at Mach 1 at ground level?
they are in the air about 5000 feet going around 350kts and speed up and travel to about 30k feet

Are the enemies spawning and pathing in a sensible way? Are they spawning underground, or at Mach 1 at ground level?
they are in the air about 5000 feet going around 350kts and speed up and travel to about 30k feet
are they set to spawn instantly?

are they set to spawn instantly?
they spawn when I do a trial run in the mission editor but when I host the scenario they don't spawn
You’re absolutely 100% sure they don’t exist when you start the scenario?

If I want a trigger from a vehicle control would being switched on be a value of 1 and off a value of 0?
Post mortem: Confusion about what the events meant caused all the enemy units to be murdered as soon as the mission started
@Throttle just had a little think, and I believe your second objective is still wrong, but not in a way that’ll stop you killing the enemy

Is there any way to get C-RAMS to engage rockets? I find them just sitting around and not doing the thing they were literally designed to do pretty goofy
They should do that automatically. They're just not very good at it
Not doing the C-RAM justice

But they can kinda hit bombs? Eh
Honestly the player would be pressed even make it over to where the c-rams are in operation without failing the mission (if the rocket trucks are allowed to fire for more than 60 seconds it's basically too much civilian infrastructure destroyed)
I've had it shoot down 3 mavericks and myself

So you're saying the literally won't even try to shoot at rocket artillery? No funny tracers?
no, they can only shoot at aircraft or missile actors
its not possible to shoot an artillery shell, im not sure if rockets have hitboxes

You can manually keep the radar on those off right?
Yeah could work
On the plus side this would leave some burning wreckage sitting around like something got hit and damaged by rockets

unless you want the ciws to be the burning wreckage?
No, I was thinking the manta
I thought they were only fully destroyed if they took enough damage or crashed from a sufficient altitude

Is there a way to turn a friendly into an enemy - change teams? Using trigger to engage enemies currently but wanted them to be 'blue' until a proximity breach (eg helo flys too close) then they turn into enemy... Didn't think killing the blue then spawning the same in red on top would work - fire/bodies left on map e.t.c.
No
Thanks

Is there any documentation or tutorial on using the mission editor? I’d like to learn more about it, but don’t have time to go in and fiddle around with it. Reading or watching something while on break at work would be better for me
There's the wiki
Ok I’ll check it out

Yo, how to add multiple players?
Create a multiplayer campaign, create a scenario in that multiplayer campaign. Create MP Spawn entities in that scenario
Ah, ok, thanks man.

For refueling. Is it necessary to set a KC-49 (for instance) with a relatively straight path, or having it orbit a way-point enough? I don't know if the refueling plane will be flying straight when/if it detect a plane is coming in for refueling ...
It can refuel in a turn, so making it orbit is fine
it's just *slightly* more difficult to refuel on a constantly turning tanker.

but you can understand how to modify the game files themselves?
:squint:
"the mission" there are a lot of missions

Why do you need/want those files?
i said that i dont know how to explain in english
Could always try google translate, but the files are just binary data im not sure how that would help you

just do you have any?
Yeah here one second
lol tried google translate its jsut giving bullshit

*what if it was hexadecimal data?*
:Think:
Nah it’s octal data

would you have the logs?
I don’t do any more
Perhaps they did respawn

Can someone explain the situation with force detected /undetected and red enemy marker display distance please. Got a mp mission in Ah94's I am working on  - proximity event  triggers x2 manpads spawning on separate roof tops - close to where a helo needs to land on a roof top in a city - the helos are limited to fcr and cannon of choice. Is the red unit marker appearance distance related e.g. If you are within x metres it dissapeard? - would force detected effect distance it shows. Helos will be within 200 metres of these sniper manpads when they spawn - is there a way to bracket them in red that close to help helo location (I know i could move them/turn them into infantry to make it easier...) just wanted to know how the red marker brackets actually work. Also I have tried to set a bunker before now to force undetected to stop it being found easily but the Ah94 still pings it with the enemy orange brackets from 100's of metres away. Is there a way to stop this?
Force detecte doesn't affect the < > around units
Force Undetected doesn't affect the ability to detect units on radar

Thank you for that explanation 👍 do you know if there are distance rules on the red brackets appearing/dissapearing in view? And if so how far away would I have to place an enemy so when it spawns it will get bracketed? - and Im assuming the visor in thd Ah94 (or Jets) doesn't effect red brackets showing or not? I'm assuming their visibility is just a distance thing.
There surely are, but I've no idea what they are
It's not pure distance

A few questions:   1. Can you develop a single mission then import it later into a campaign or do you have to develop the mission as a campaign set from the beginning?  2. Can a unit/units have a randomized spawn point (possible locations picked in the editor) and can units have a percent chance of spawning?  3. Can you have randomized secondary objectives and what may be some logic things to consider to prevent bugs?
1) Single player, yes. Multiplayer, no.
2) Yes, yes.

Is there a way to limit the starting fuel level for the player? I manually added "fuel = 50" to the player section (in its "UnitFields") like I saw it done for other units, but in the 'equip' screen in game it was still set to full. I'd like to enforce the player starting with less fuel, as to inforce the need to hit a tanker first.
Internally fuel is typically a percentage, not sure if it’s the same in the mission editor but I’m guessing you want .5 fuel
I assumed it was percent, since for example that field was set to 100 for a E-4.

i really need an AI respawner tool. Is there not a single way to respawn units after they died?
nah
the best you can do is copy the unit and spawn it again

When you're calling for a unit to trigger a waypoint in a multiplayer campaign mission, is 'Player' and 'MP_Spawn' the same in this instance?
yes
turns out this needs 3 conditions to be met for each alternate spawn :pain:

how do i add wingmen?
Set your player to alpha squad and place a wingman of your choice and set their squad to alpha
when i say form up on me they say they are busy

Hey, in the mission editor is the 'Move Spawn' trigger action bugged? Each time I trigger it in a mission I end up really bugged out with graphic glitches and I just see a blue sky as far as I can see.
help! Everytime my missions says mission completed at 0:00:00
but it only shows after i kill 1 enemy unit

Hello, I am launching VTOL VR withotu my headset plugged in, and want to jump into the Mission Editor, I am right now in the main menu, but can't click on any of the buttons (QUIT, MAP EDITOR, MISSION EDITOR) Is there something I am missing?
newbug
Go to "previous version"

Is that a Battlefield 4 thing as the thumbnail? I love it
Would anyone be interested in trying a different style of mission? I call it project unlimited. Enemys are scattered all over the map and enemy aircraft spawn every 20 minutes to intercept. It'd be a good air and ground mix
For the fa26

random encounters moment

Do the targets get marked? Or do you expect people to search for them? Note that currently it is impossible to respawn units. You are limited by the number of times you are willing to copy those units and triggers.
There's alot of enemies on the map so I didn't add any waypoints. If you can't find something to shoot there's something wrong
No real objective just fly and blow shit up as you get intercepted every 20 min. Some planes are fighters some are bombers and some are uavs

What's the objective? Kill everything, or just a certain number?
Oh
Personally I wouldn't be as interested in a mission with no final objective, but others might like it.

Does a mission end when all objectives that exist have been completed(either as a success or a failure)? Or do i need to set some sort of mission ending logic?
Once the last active objective is ended, the mission ends
Thanks!

Hi, I have a few questions i couldnt find here after searching:   1: I created a simple scenario in the current release build as a sort of firing range for me and a friend to practice AH ATG combat, I‘ve read to play it in MP you have to edit it in the test build to set up spawns etc.  How do I get there and can i „port“ my scenario to the testing version (and back if it can be played on in the release branch) and how do i set up different spawns for other vehicles? (Right now i have parked AI as placeholders)  2: As a fitting end to destroying all the practice Targets i set up a RTB objective that triggers if either the vehicle is damaged, low on fuel (is the entered number a percentage e.g 20.00 or do i have to enter 00.20 for 20%?) or all targets are destroyed, and to counter the RTB disappearing if there a mid mission refuel i set up a RTB2 that only triggers if all enemies are destroyed, would that work or will the game be confused if i were to complete both RTBs at once?  3: For AI ground units theres an option for something called move in radius. What is that Radius and can it be changed?  Thanks you all ^^
1) You can now create and play custom scenarios in multiplayer in the regular build, so no more need for public testing
It's possible to convert a single player scenario to a multiplayer one, but I'm not sure of the exact steps

Ok thanks a lot, so just start the current build and instead of mission editor go to campaign editor and then theres an option to go for mp ones?
Where you'd normally pick the aircraft, there's a tick box for multiplayer
(When creating a campaign)

does cancel objective not work when the objective is started then?
Interesting. Didn't know that was there
No idea what it does

how to make artillery/rocket artillery fire at target?
There's an event action for that
oh ok ty

is it possible to get player count the easy way?
I use cancel objective on non required objective for AAS
nvm, I half answered my own question for getting player count on a single team:

I would like to make a mission, but i dont have many good ideas, does anyone have some ideas for missions?
you don't need a good mission idea just a good way to execute it.
but its impossible to make a (good) mission without an idea

if you want to do a multiplayer operation, here's the brief for one i did with my server https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EgLHsw29X7MUXfX_X_vP6OPMqDk689Ms-vOW6FzuE0Y/edit?usp=sharing
its milsim so if thats not what you want it might not be super helpful
for me i just envision shit that may happen in like 15 years

Anyone know if there's a way to compare 2 global values?
I can think of a really horribly way
oh god

Have most of the recent bugs been ironed out? Sounds like it. I may jump back into the editor and fool around some more
I'll just do a big nor statement for now, since i t's not there anyway.
have you heard of lua

lol. You still work for Downpour btw?
Yeah I've worked there for a while
great

How? Most missions are not linear in the slightest
You can customize lua however you want, you can make it entirely event based if you want.
What is there now is a scripting language. A visual one. It's just very limited

Does it do run it more than once?
every second in fact :)
What?

You are aware events can only be run once yes?
Updates right before points are awarded to the team with air superiority
Every kill?

> You are aware events can only be run once yes?
If it's true more than once
It will only run once

what is the CPU cost of an event?
A certain amount
what happens if you call stop/start on an event after a certain time, will it go again?

what happens if you call stop/start on an event after a certain time, will it go again?
No
Only once can an event run

how does it check whether the event has been run? does it keep a list by their ID's? or is it a property
You also can't respawn a destroyed unit. And an unspawned unit is considered alive
good question, I recommend you look into that yourself in the massive fuck-off class that is the editor's and tell us about it too pls!

what does the property "RTB Waypoint is Spawn" do for player spawns in multiplayer?
use spawn pos as RTB waypoint
I uploaded a (training) campaign to Steam Workshop, but when I go to Steam Workshop in the game, it only shows maps ... ?

You’re in the wrong Steam Workshop bit
Back all the way out to where you select the aircraft on the main menu, and use the Steam Workshop there

how big should a helicopter map be?
At 200kts, it takes the heli about 16 minutes to fly 100km (54 nm). Depending on how much traveling you want the players to do in order to get to the objective, you can use that as a starting point.

It is not currently possible to make tunnels with the editor in the game, correct?
It is not possible to create tunnels
Use an Event Sequence. Add a node with a separate entry condition for each one of those groups. Then it will only be checking one group at a time, reducing the performance cost. Also, this makes it easier to debug as each sequence node advancement gets logged in player.log, so you can see which group didn't trigger.

Air to air helicopter refueling when?
It's not about the fuel/range it's about the flight time. :/
Change the spawn point of the helicopter at certain checkpoints so if they die they wouldnt have to go all the way back.

Is there a way to make landing on a carrier an objective? Seems that only waypoint can be used for "landing" type objective. But the ships are moving .... maybe with some custom rule thing?
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/960626322730807306
Thank you. I'll give it a try

what do you mean by "choose the carrier"?
oh, you can pick the carrier at the waypoint!
yeah that. XD

You've done a LOT of debugging, haven't you? There's a whole thread just for your mission alone. XD
It's the game's fault I swear!
For real, yeah it's a pain to debug. Giving everything unique names (units and event sequence nodes) and reading the player.log makes debugging triggers and kills much easier.

Anyone have some general advice on designing missions that include both the AH and other vehicles in satisfying ways? I feel like the fixed wing vehicles end up often overshadowing the helicopter's role due to how quickly they can get from spawn to objective to objective
The AH-94's major advantage is its gun, which can kill a LOT of ground targets
1) spawn it *closer* than the jets

hello everyone, is there a quick guide about how the spawning works with the new multiplayer?
Players spawn on the map spawns
Hi guys,  I'm busy making a mission for MP (not that this should matter), but I'm struggling to spawn one unit only out of a collection of units (so I don't know this unit's end spawn location when I start the mission so it's basically random). All respective units are set to not spawn immediately.  I'm trying to use the Sequence Event to accomplish this, but I think I might be understanding it incorrectly.  How I currently have it set up: - Each node has an entry condition of Chance 15% - Each node has an exit condition of a check for if a global value is 0 (I have a global value set up to default to 0) - If a node has its entry condition matched (Chance 15%), it will spawn the respective unit (I have a node per unit) and then it sets the global value to 1  Every time I boot the level up, none of the units spawn (I even have the last node's entry condition simply set to check if the global value is still 0 meaning no units have spawned so the last one HAS to).  I have also initially tried setting only the entry condition of each node to Chance 15% AND if the global value is 0 (last node only checked for the global value = 0), yet this still did not work either.  So my question is basically this: If a node's entry condition IS NOT MET, do the other nodes even fire off?

Sequential events MUST fire in sequence. That is, sequence 2 cannot fire if sequence 1 doesn't. If the 15% for sequence 1 fails, then the entire rest of the sequence hangs right there.
You'd probably be best off just using one unit and giving it a bunch of alternate spawn locations

I am a software dev so fortunately that logic is all good haha.  Still thanks a bunch.  Final question though, but how do we test launch MP campaigns that are simply saved to disk?  As mentioned above I need to publish my changes to the workshop before being able to launch it (as far as I know since I can't see my mission anywhere else other than the MP host screen)
from the mission editor there should be a way to launch
I wish players would leave more feedback on steam for mission builder to know what to fix, improve

Is there a way to prevent a wingman from doing a vertical takeoff on the attack carrier? I have setup a training mission starting on the carrier, but instead of taxing and doing a short takeoff, it just go for a vertical one from the spawning point ...
Problem is vote is for the whole workshop item, so a full campaign getting a weird vote because of a specific mission .
A link to the workshop page item could be interesting

Hello, I created a campaign with one mission. I tested today with some people and tried to remove bugs. If you wanna try it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2792930907
What aircraft is it for?
all of them, except the F45

What aircraft is it for?
all of them, except the F45
I forgot to say, it is multiplayer

How many people is it designed for? There's literally no information on the workshop page lol
5 or more
Good idea to include briefing notes on workshop page

Perhaps I need to set it up differently?
What would cause a wingman to not refuel at the tanker we're just behind when asked to do so? It definitely could have used some juice. Instead it keept flying off (to who knows where)
he probably has his refuel location set to somewhere that's not the air tanker.

it's RTB was set to "none", maybe it should be have been set to the tanker?

it's RTB was set to "none", maybe it should be have been set to the tanker?
yea thatll probably fix it
actually, the wingman unit doesn't have a refuel location. The one set is the scenario info

are you sure or telling it to refuel and not rtb?
You don't have to use the option "Final" to end the game. Just use the option "pre required" objective. And mark the objective box as "required"
 As long as all objectives are completed the game wil end.
But which ones? The objectives won’t all be activated, and so won’t all be completed

But which ones? The objectives won’t all be activated, and so won’t all be completed
Then disable the box "required"
And use the pre-required or triggered option but not "Final".
Ok, so I can set it as preq, but don’t tick any objectives? Also I thought the required option meant the objective needed to be completed to complete the mission, which is my intention. Is the required option just for triggering the start of the objective?

Is there something in the logic I could use to trigger the RTB objective?
I’m thinking I could set flags each time an objective is triggered, then on completion. Flag is set to zero and at the end of each objective manually trigger an event that looks to see if all the flags are zero

Can a conditional event be enabled multiple times and will it work properly?

Can a conditional event be enabled multiple times and will it work properly?
Example scenario 2 of the 3 possible objectives are triggered. At the end of each those objectives there’s a conditional trigger enabled on completion of each that if flags associated with those objectives are all 0 (untriggered objectives should also be 0), then start RTB
Yes,

It looks like there is no way to make the player invincible. Is that correct?
... I wonder if having "triggered event" that repair the player everytime its damaged would work ...
isn't there an "invincible" flag you can set?

isn't there an "invincible" flag you can set?
For AI units, yes. None that I can find for the player
I wish there was a way to set an ETA for a sea unit/group when they are moving to  a waypoint ...

when testing a mission, you can make the player invunerable no?
yes, but in this case I'd like it to be invincible outside of testing
There is currently no option for that.

or am i thinking to simple here?
My thought is RTB start is triggered when when all possible obj flags are 0. If obj triggered add 1, when completed  sub 1. Each possible obj will have an associated flag. My mission has a static primary goal with random obj starting after it, so the RTB trigger check would be enabled after when the random objs initialize
I’ll need to experiment though

That works? I’d assume the mission would end after the last active objective is completed, as the final objective hasn’t started yet
Final objective will automatically start if there is no other objective active
Oh yeah, you'll need a temporary objective that gets canceled when the real objectives are rolled

After a few playthroughs it seemed pretty bug free, so I went ahead and uploaded it.  Feel free to leave any feedback or bugs encountered https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2793506276
You can edit the title and description in the Steam Workshop so you're not limited by the in-game editor character limits. So you don't have to make a comment lol.  Mobile doesn't have tags. What vehicle is this for? If it's multiplayer, you should probably list that in the description.
@jas4500 I'm streaming working on DynLib right now if you're still interested.

It does reset everytime you publish an update, so keep the text saved somewhere for easy copy-paste.

Is there a way in the editor to designate Bullseye points?
First create a waypoint for it, then set it under Edit -> Scenario Info
why do so many people call their map "pvp/freeflight"

Is there a way to get troops to stay in radius but not stay in the same 10 foot area? I set staying radius as a behavior and set the way point and they just walk around this tiny little area
Maybe have them patrol a path?
Guess that'll have to do

Maybe have them patrol a path?
Guess that'll have to do
You can set multiple paths, and randomly have each infantry choose which one they patrol. if you feel like making all those scripts. or can open the VTS in notepad and just copy-paste them

Hey, is there a way to make my player VTOL spawn in full of infantry to deliver them to the drop-off?
Is there not a Passengers button on the player unit properties. Likely not in mp though
unless im blind

how do I make it happen?
Send it to an island somewhere for pickup?
How do you make what happen?

Send it to an island somewhere for pickup?
How do you make what happen?
A multiplayer mission where you have to deliver ai infantry to a drop off

How do you make what happen?
A multiplayer mission where you have to deliver ai infantry to a drop off
You'd need to pick them up first

6 infantry men is max for the av correct?
8
Thank you

can it contain a manpad?
Yup
Hell, it can contain 8 manpads

Can someone explain the rewards system to me?
also , how do I know who's team A and who's team b?
Team A is formally known as allies

also , how do I know who's team A and who's team b?
Team A is formally known as allies
Team B is formally known as enemies

Is there no way to go back into map editor and make changes while working on the mission?
:sadge:
Yup

Where is the scenario editor located?
It's the mission editor
Found it

is there a way I can make an objective to both pilots to RTB to their own cruisers to complete the mission?
I think I found it
My paths are a bit separated from the cruisers, are they still going to follow them if assigned properly?

Yup
What's the action to fail the mission? (ex: oilrig destroyed)

What's the action to fail the mission? (ex: oilrig destroyed)
set a team B objective
It's a coop mission, no enemy players

so I just make a team b objective to destroy the rig?
yes
So you can do that with events?

So you can do that with events?
:KEKW_A:
no that is objectives

Isnt the ai going to start blasting the rig?
yes
That's not what we want

Can't I just make 5 actions failing all the objectives of team A if oilrig is destroyed?
would this work?
yeah?

This should still fail the mission though right?
I'll test it
I would assume so, but have no idea

wait do i have to be in ptb?
No, but you have to be creating a multiplayer scenario
oh

where can i do that?
To create a multiplayer scenario, create a multiplayer campaign, then create a scenario in it
ahhhhh

For proximity triggers, where do I set the proximity point?
does it create itself when I click "New trigger"
It's the Waypoint

Is it a bad idea to put manpads on an oil rig that can't be destroyed in order to complete a mission?
:PepeLaughing:
Feel like that's going to be almost impossible to complete without dying, there is like 0 cover cause it's in the middle of the ocean

What's the manpad targeting range?
Couple of km, but manpad missiles are extremely easy to dodge
And by dodge, I mean defeat using flares

If I voice-over the whole brief page, do you have a button to turn off the voice over in multiplayer if you want to read it yourself?
Negative
:bigsadge:

For a multiplayer mission, do you recommend just leaving it without a voice-over?
I guess it's personal preference
For briefing, since player will mostly talks, its better to not have notes voice.  Opposed to if you play singleplayer mission.

Is there a way to spawn infantery at the position of a moving vehicle (as a trigger)? I can spawn them on a trigger, but their position will be the original one (as set in the editor), not the position they should be at
Nope
ugh, thanks

yeah that's the problem ... Will they walk if I set a waypoint to them?
If you tell them to walk to the waypoint, yeah
You can do it immediately after spawning them

Anyone know what speed they are going to?
For a vehicle you can set the speed, but not for infantery units.
What does the "follow" mode do? I have seen that question posted a few times in this channel, but no one seems to know

What does the "follow" mode do? I have seen that question posted a few times in this channel, but no one seems to know
I'm gonna assume "Slow 10" is 10kph which sound like maybe it will be infantery speed
or is it 10m/s?

Looks like there's no way to get a UAVC to "protect" a moving unit, right?
i mean, you can make it fly in formation with an aircraft
but uhh, not a tank or anything

is it realistic to use an aircraft to escort a ground vehicle?
Orbitting a spot ?
I think having a UAVC orbiting a moving column not that un-realistic

the Manta? ... sorry forgot the acronym for it
you can have a big orbit radius and change the orbit point every 10 km
manta ucav yes

Will your mission will be that long?
Infantry are so slow that you can basically have the UCAV orbit a single waypoint and the infantry will never be out of range
yeah, that's a good idea

if the orbit point is "none", will it orbit the spawn point?
usually yes
Someone mentioned setting the orbit raduis ... but I haven't find a UI control in the editor to do so ...

difference between path and rail path?
no idea! lol
hopefully someone who's tested it knows

speaking of paths. I edited the VTS file to duplicate a path (and change the altitude of the points that compose it) and used for id the id of the last path + 1, but while the mission loads in the editor, that added path doesn't show up in the list. What give?
im sure they are just the same now.
as lots of people had problem with bridges with path so now its just sticks to the path set.

Did you put the friendly carrier speeds there too? They weren't last I checked
its been there for at least a year
i have all the healths of every unit also

Can anyone confirm if they've seen "Vehicle Control" events working in multiplayer?
Also has the non-targets list worked in MP
yes

Will a TEAM B manpad engage and shoot down an AI TEAM A aircraft?
Yes
Thanks

take off / wait is not landed / follow path?
Quick question for those that may know how to assist: Is there any easy way to determine if all players in a MP mission have landed near a waypoint?  If I use groupings and check if all players have landed, this does not work since not all MP spawn slots (that are also part of that group) have players. I also don't see anything in the lines of 'Active Player Units' or something like that so I take it the logical check for 'All Units in Group have landed' checks every unit assigned even if that unit has yet to have a player choose and spawn on it.  I have tried using the land objective, but I believe this completes if any player has landed in the defined radius. I want all active players to have to land
My mission has 2 mp spawns, a VTOL and an ah-94.  In the briefing room, the 2 available vehicles for spawn are both VTOL

why don't I get an option to spawn in an ah?

why don't I get an option to spawn in an ah?
Make sure you've saved and uploaded the version where the ah spawn has been set to be ah
They were both set to VTOL, sorry

Is there any way I can switch Bravo 1-1 vehicle with Alpha 1-1 vehicle? I've set-up all the voice-overs for the mission for Alpha 1-1 to be the AH-94, but in the brief room the VTOL is Alpha 1-1
I'm guessing I'd have to switch the cruisers around and re-configure the spawns and the paths?
:AE_PepeStare:

I'm guessing I'd have to switch the cruisers around and re-configure the spawns and the paths?
:AE_PepeStare:
The callsigns are based on the unit group the aircraft are in

Where do I do that?
Here?
I dont think I set up unit groups, I just have team A and team B

Time (sec) = 5 means the message will play 5 sec after the game starts right?
After the event's triggered
5sec after that delayed trigger is enabled

Is there a way to create an objective dynamically? I'd like to setup a scenario where you have to fly to a hold-off position then (after a delay) get a message telling you to engage a specific target (with GPS coord provided at that moment).
No, but you can create a pile of objective/unit/GPS points, then pick one at random
Yeah, I suppose the objective could be "generic". Thanks @Skumby

is that possible to setup?
Looks like you're going to have to use a triggered objective instead
Oh, I could also make 2 objectives, one called RTB VTOL and another RTB AH94

What were you wanting with this?
each vehicle to have a waypoint back to their spawns
2 different cruisers

Okay, how do I specify that mp Spawn 1 has to be landed on a cruiser?
Cant connect the 3
There are AND and OR connectors

How do I integrate the created event trigger (the RTB one) into an objective that has a completion reward?
You don't put it in an event trigger 😛 There's an objective type that is completed by trigger
Yeah you said it but backwards, same thing I think?

Yeah you said it but backwards, same thing I think?
I think I did it
:clueless:

Any way to set a delay to a radio message on a conditional trigger?
I want a radio message to play when the tank is destroyed but not the second it happens
at least 5 seconds later

if I set the waypoint for the infantry I'm delivering, won't they try to swim to it before I pick them up?
Not sure what you mean
So I'm picking up infantry and dropping them off but they are running back to where I picked them up from

There isnt a button to remove the audio file from the brief page, do I just re-make it?
Interesting. Guess so
The game could use some built in TTS

Alright , last thing for today, any way to setup a waypoint for each vehicle at the start of the mission?
So a different waypoint to each vehicle
I'm not sure you can

Could they be dying from the burning VTOL somehow?
an enemy tank?
ye

will they still die to friendly damage?
no?
:lysMath:

the Receive Friendly Damage tag is new, maybe its bugged?
there is nothing friendly shooting at them
Reading between the lines, I believe they want them to take friendly damage so CAS can’t just nuke the entire beach from orbit

Hi, can someone please host and check my new mission? I would love to hear some feedback https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2794151653&searchtext=  I'm really new to this
im trying to setup a free flight mission on the world v3 map.. how do i actually do that, in the mission editor ive selected the map but if i want it to be mp idk how to do that.. i can only add 1 spawn point
you have to make an MP campaign

and why is that a slider?
If you don’t use the UI budget, it gets cut next year
hi everyone, i'm working on my first mission rn and i need some help. All the AI planes want to take off from the same cat. I tried having them use taxi paths to the cats i want them to go to, but they would just turn around and try to get on the other cat. Am i missing something obvious?

It's pretty much just up to the tower handing out cat assignments. It *should* assign them to different cats though if a bunch of jets want to take off at once. I might suggest staggering the timing of giving the order to take off. If you're telling all the jets to take off at the same time, then they might ask be getting assigned the same cat because it's currently "empty" at the exact moment they are all requesting to take off.
I'll try that, thanks ^^

Not something I've come across before. You can't type in the correct value over the number?
No sir
Guess you're stuck then

Once I upload the mission to steam, can I still make adjustments and update it?
Yup
:peepoGlad:

"Requires link" do I just put a radar next to it or is there anything else to it?
On one of them, the unit properties has a button to assign radars to launchers, or launchers to radars. Can't remember which way around it goes
Thank you

Any way to make infantry follow an IRAPC without assigning the path to each one?
There is a follow option but Idk what he's following
I have no idea what Follow does

how do I create a unit?
hmm
And then tell the group to follow a path in the line formation

no button to create a unit?
Its on the unit properties
got it thanks

Do you have other objectives that have start mode Immediate?
Yes but those dont have auto set waypoint checked
Fixed

are they going to drive under the textures?
As long as it's somewhere close, they'll drive along the ground surface. I'm not sure how far away it'd need to be for them to burrow/fly, or if they even can
ok

Any way to make rocket boats to engage friendly air vehicles?
They'll only engage extremely slow moving/hovering air vehicles
Most air vehicles will fly faster than their rockets

Haven't shot at us, is their range that low?
we were at about 15-20km and they didnt engage us
They fire IR missiles, so anything more than 5km will be pushing it

anything on wheels that is long range?
Found it
The only thing that can move and fire at those sorts of ranges is the MAD-4, and it can't move and fire

so if I have a mad-4 rolling on a path,it wont stop to fire?
Nope
ok

Do I need to do anything special to make a mission multiplayer?
You need to create a multiplayer campaign, then make a scenario in that campaign
Thanks

What is the max player count?
16

Are there any resources for someone to learn the mission editor from zero?
or just, how one creates missions.
Create mission. Pick map. Place player, friends and enemies. Add objectives. Add mission title, description and briefing. Publish to Steam Workshop

Is there any way to make the UI within the Editor not insanely small?
It's not insanely small for me, so *shrug*
I am playing on a 4k Monitor and the Letters are literally the size of an ants foot.

hoe do i rotate units for exampl?
I forgor 💀
Q and E

neat. lets say i want to place a unit in the sky, in flight, is ther a way to change the curser altidude with buttons like wasdqe, or do i have to type in an altidue?
Hold shift and spin the mousewheel
neat

rn, my very simple scenario i want to make is, you take off as an av42 with a single av42 as wingmen, to kill one drone carrier and its drones. i want the wingmen av42 to take off, orbit, and form up once the player is in the air. how do i set up this behavior wof the AI av42?
Using events
Do you want it to take off before the player, or after them?

Do you want it to take off before the player, or after them?
they take off while the player starts up the aircraft, and then forms up on them after the player took off
Trickier, as there's no decent trigger for "starts up the aircraft"

after the player took off and reaches a certain altidue maybe?
You can test for that, yes
Check out the Events tab on the right, and then the Triggered tab at the top of that

so, i f i want the ai to take off immediatly after mission start, i put its behavior to "takeoff"?
Be cautious of the Is Landed state, as player aircraft can spawn a few inches in the air, which counts as flying
Yeah, if it's set to takeoff, it'll taxi and takeoff if it can't take off vertically

how to set that state?
You can't set it. You can test for it though, in the triggered event conditional editor (and other things which allow you to set conditions)
i have made it dependend on altitude and airspeed of the player for now, but how do i link it to the ai doing something?

What've you created that in? A triggered event?
yes

What've you created that in? A triggered event?
yes
i think?

Can you post a screenshot of the triggered event window? The internet doesn't have oen
i think i got it anyways...
it looks like this now, with the trigger conditions and logic stuff being the above image

wont "from on pilot" do?
Not without setting the target leader field
Every aircraft has a pilot, technically

i want the ship to follow a path, i have created one, set the direction, and moved the carrier at the end. will it automatically moce to the first point of the path upon mission start?
If you've set the path to be its default path (in its unit properties) it'll move to the closest point, and follow it
neat

whats the default behavior of an ai aircraft after it took off and didnt get any other instructions? the time between "is in the air" and "Player is in the air, causing it to form up"
in my case
It'll just orbit the airfield.

perfect. Do ai struggle with terrain when in a orbit state? it will take off vertically, and the airfield on "the Island" has those mountains around it...
They're reasonably good at avoiding terrain
i have killed many people by telling them to form up and then flying too low or close to obstacles

will try that if it crashes. If i save a scenario, will it automatically show up in the Custom missions tab? also, i didnt see any way to make it for a specific aircraft...
It'll appear in the custom missions tab, yeah. You set the aircraft that the mission is for in the Scenario Settings (or something like that). It's in one of the menus at the top
ah okay

just open the game without a vr headset plugged in
Ethan, I did that. However, there is an end user license agreement for which I cannot accept without a VR controller

hoe do i tie a Waypoint to a unit so it moves with it?
You can’t

hoe do i tie a Waypoint to a unit so it moves with it?
You can’t
eh?

okay, i want the carrier to be marked with a waypoint that move with it, how do i do that?
In-game waypoints can be mission editor waypoints, or ossasionally units
You can’t

Were they the target of a land or destroy or other objective?
The mission i made, no, it was a rendezvous type mission. Fly to this cruiser, then fly cap until it reaches land
So yeah it was an objective that created the in game waypoint

alright, i want the simple objective of the player having to destroy the drone carrier and all the drones together with his wingmen. would that work?
Use the Waypoint entry in the top bit
Ahz

i know how to make a immediate objective and its waypoint upon mission startup, but i i want a new objective to pop up once the player gets to a certain location, how do i do that?
So you could have one objective for the search bit, which is completed when you find it, starts another objective, to destroy it, which sets the objective on the unit
1st objective: search this area for carrier. Success condition is being within X meters of the ship, which triggers objective 2

how do i give an aobjective a trigger? ai, ship found= start destroy obj
Each new objective you force to start through an event, or you can have objectives start based on when previous objectives are finished
For the objective, set the start type to prereq, and tick the search objective

what unit is this slider? nautical miles? meters? km?
nvm the box below explains it
Everything is meters

i want the objective to be completed once the player is within a certain range of the carrier, but how do i set a "search for" obj that reacts when the carrier is found?
Can you take a screenshot of the options for Objective Type plz
those are the only types of objectives i can set, and the "fly to" wich is the closest to what i need only lets me pick manually set, static waypoints. the "destroy" type lets me select the carrier asa waypoint

probably. A km is not too far or too close right? i might have to tweak that though, as aviation, games in general, and ESPECIALLY this game tend to screw up my sense of scale a lot
The drone cruiser does have a vertical launch missile rack
1000 seems a lot, until you realise that this is less than the min distance for most weapons lol

is there some sort of resource, apart from the wiki, that has details on each units capabilities and ranges?
Nope, because they’re so dependent on other factors
could i set the carrier to only attack once discovered?

could i set the carrier to only attack once discovered?
Yes
There’s a tick box on the unit properties for their ability to attack, and you can use events to turn it back on

should i tick the Engage box?
Yup
what does "PreReqs" standfor, and is this the correct setup to start a new obj upon completion of the last one?

what does "PreReqs" standfor, and is this the correct setup to start a new obj upon completion of the last one?
Prerequisites
And yes

shall i leave it as this start mode?
Tick the previous objective to the left
this?

The first objective should have a different start type (Initial? Start up?)
immediate?
All the rest should have start type prereq with the previous objective ticked

so, there are multible ways to reach the same result in the end?
yes
it's just a matter of organizing them

in that case, like this?
i removed the condition for the player to be near the carrier to finish the objective, and replaced it by being triggered by the "offensive" event
other way around lol

it begins the destroy carrier objective though?
once the search is complete, you destroy it
"Start Event" = When this objective is given to the player, do these things. So you're telling the game, as soon as I give the player the "Search Carrier" objective, I want you to then begin the objective "Destroy Targets"

does ai have the same trouble using weapons that are not faf as players? like, should i give the ai AV42 Agm114 or Agm65?
I expect the AI will be fine at using any AGMs you give it
though you run the risk of the AI just killing the carrier by itself and player wondering what he was there for. XD

btw, i set an obj start mode to triggered, where do i set the trigger condidtion for it? rn, i only know how to use the prereqs and immediate modes
I generally like to give differing missions to the player and AI. something along the lines of "you bring bombs/AGMs/etc to kill these targets, your wingman will bring air-to-air missiles to cover you from enemy fighter threats" or the reverse.
I believe the only way to start that is with an event action

ah, so setting it to triggered, it will let me add it to actions performed by events?
i might do that, starting the search obj after take off, and the firt obj being just to take off
sort of? Again, it's just an alternate way of starting an objective

sort of? Again, it's just an alternate way of starting an objective
It's used more for things like randomized objectives, when you don't know the exact order you want objectives to be completed in (for which you would just use a series of Prereq style objectives)
if you wanted to start search after take off, that's something that will never change, and that's better suited just having the search obj be a prereq objective, and tick "take off"

what would be the best way to detect if a player has taken off, apart from airspeed and alt?
That's actually probably the best way to do it.
there is the "Is not landed" condition, but that will fire as soon as you're a centimeter off the ground lol

Is there a way for me to make aircrafts spawn after a base is destroyed? Like an event? If so how can I do it?
Airbases don't get destroyed. They can only change factions.
What I meant is when an objective is complete

is there a way to have a ships radar off and have it not engage anything until a certain event is triggered, ie, getting within a certain distance of it? I tried setting the "engage enemies" box off, but i was still getting pinged by its radar and being shot at, Waaay before i got within the range i set
this didnt work. the "engage enemies" box is off in the units own settings.
oooooh i had it set sop that the carrier was set to engage as soon as the search obj starts lmao

alright, if i want to set up a small fleet travelling in formation next to each other, whats the best way to do that? Do i set baths for each of them next to each other, or can i just give all of them the same patch and they will automatically hold formation? also, do all ships and boats travel at the same speeds?
If you add them all to the same unit group they will automatically make a formation
amazing

how do i tell a group? i only found a way to tell each unit individually
i set them all as the same group, but i dont see a way to tell an entire group to follow a patch. i punched it into each units manually to follow the same path
I believe there's an event for telling a Unit Group to do something. But AFAIK if you tell the first unit in the group to follow a path, everyone else automatically follows the leader. This does mean that if you put units in a group, *you cannot separate them.*

any way to make gunboats and drone carriers move the same speed?
they all follow the path, but at diffrent speeds, and right behind each other. should i delete the path out of all but one and just keep them as a group?
Use a timed event, Starting Immediately, to give the unit group an event action to follow the path

they all follow the path, but at diffrent speeds, and right behind each other. should i delete the path out of all but one and just keep them as a group?
Use a timed event, Starting Immediately, to give the unit group an event action to follow the path
it only spawns in the group once the player is close to the search waypoint

did that, now delete the path out of the individual units?
so, as soon as the player is locking any of the units with either tgp or arad, the carrier group gets set to engage
Won’t help, won’t harm. The event action will override the default action

Hi Devoss, I use the chance logic box set to 50% in a conditional trigger event to get a random chance of say then spawning a unit. Is this the best way of randomising stuff? Seen a post ages ago mentioning using global values but can't figure out how this would work.
i want to have a troop of infantr, and a convoy of vehicles driving a loop around the airbase so it seems more busy and interesting. i have asingned the infantry and the vehicles to group, and given all of them paths and the correct behavior, but they do not move in the mission
i now set a triggered event with the trigger being "player is landed" wich ias a given at the start of the mission, and the action being both groups being send to their respective paths

Anyone know why some of my ai pilots don't know how to take off? Sometimes they veer off course and start doing donuts cuz they try to taxi back to the runway in full AB
Yep. Arranging into formation
If they get even a little bit off the ground, like a bounce or spawning in just above ground level, they'll assume they've taken off and try to fly

Is there any way to avoid it or fix it? Or just don't spawn enemies on the ground..?
Depends what's causing it. What's the circumstances where they do it?
Well, I spawn them at an airfield and give them a takeoff order. It's a flight of four and they're all given the TO command as a unit group. They taxi normally and then try to takeoff. It's not always happening, but when it does it clogs the entire airfield until the stunt pilot manages to take off (that happened once) or is destroyed.

The airfield is situated on top of a plateau and it had to be significantly flattened when I placed the airfield in the map editor. Maybe thats the case?

I got nothing. Weird
Are you giving them the order the same time you spawn them?

Are you giving them the order the same time you spawn them?
Oh they taxi then mess up on take off. Maybe try staggering the take off orders? Other than that i have no further ideas
Do you mean the initial command to take off(when they are still in the hangars), or them entering the runway?

I figure you mean the initial command, because the ATC is taking care of staggering the actual take-offs for me

nope. you could just unplug the VR headset though lol
but it'll still start SteamVR

Can't get rtb way point is spawn to work on stable mp campaign editor. X1 ah-94 initial spawn point on airfield heli pad. Want respawn to be away from airbase in mountains - set way point on another heli pad in alt location ticked rtb way point is spawn and then ensured in edit scenarios under settings rtb way point is set as alt. Still respawns at airfield? Any suggestions please.
Also are rocket artillery enemy ai not working properly? Set them 6km out (pop up says they engage 2-8km) and prioritises targets on the airfield but they just keep targeting a section of the airbase runway - is there a certain type of unit they will/won't attack - I've tried infantry, refuel points , big storage tents and (which in hindsight is probably wrong) parked av42s. What am I missing please?
I'm pretty sure rocket artillery can only fire at a point you specify. they do not attempt to target units (because they can't see them, anyways), they just shoot directly at the waypoint you give them

so if your waypoint for the airport is just in the center of the runway, and you tell them to attack the airport waypoint.... then they're firing at the runway

If i'm following correctly you're trying to move a player spawn and have your rtb waypoint change with your moving spawn?
how can i get ai pilots that take off before me to form up? i'm in the same flight group and player command is set to group only

Try setting a trigger so that when you're airborn or you reach 'x' altitude above ground your wingmen then form up on you (leader or specific unit).

is it maybe because they don't recognize me as leader since they took off before me?
Any way to know where is NORTH in the mission editor
set cursor heading 0

Is this button only bugged for me or anyone else??
SO annoying
doesnt playback the radio call sometimes

is there any way to trigger a radio voice line when the vtol is about to crash? (lost engines, heavy damage etc)
I know you can trigger one if the health is below a certain point
its very hard to tell if a player is about to crash

Is it correct that an AI wingman won’t land at a Refuel point that isn’t an official airbase?
yes and no. you can have aircraft both friendly or enemy land anywhere that is allowed to land. in one mission I even had an enemy vtol capable bomber land on a friendly medium size boat and 'capture' it via triggers. but as far as refueling goes, I believe they will need an airbase, but I'm not sure on that. I think they need to be able to access the tents in the airbase's to resupply. maybe someone else can verify that part
Alright, thanks

how do I make enemy planes attack certain positions?
Planes will attack any enemy unit they find. You generally just need to get them somewhere near where you want them

If you want them to be focused in their murder, you can give them priority targets using the event action

Here's one for you guys - I'm trying to do a reward mechanic in an MP mission, where completing a side-task gives you more budget. The "Destroy" objective, for example, provides this mechanic. However I want it on a simple drop-off objective. This has a "Completion Reward" value, which I've set, but it doesn't seem to be financial credits as completing the goal didn't change the budget. Am I missing a trick, am I doing it wrong, is it bugged or is it not possible?
I'm not sure if rewards work like that.
I've never used them

whats the hull number on allied ships in the editor?
It’s the giant number painted in the hull
oh

is is possible to have a dropoff waypoint for troops on a moving ship?
static yes. moving no
crap. i assume infantry and other ground units just cant exist on moving ships?

crap. i assume infantry and other ground units just cant exist on moving ships?
They have no physics
The ship will just move out from under them

does it have to be static throughout the whole mission, or can i make it stop and start?
if it move after they on the shgip they will slip as the ship move
You also can’t set a unit as the waypoint for a drop off

how do I add another base?
Bases can only be created in the map editor
You can make farp-like assembles in the scenario editor

Any way I can make a mission complete radio message to work?
Score is... kills isn't it? I don't think your objectives can give kills?
Or is there a different way to add points to score

Score is... kills isn't it? I don't think your objectives can give kills?
Or is there a different way to add points to score
I'm guessing the score total there is actually kills+your 4 objectives, so it went over 100 at some point when 25 was added to it, so it never exactly equaled 100

Hi skumby - just wanted to try some stuff in the editor before coming back to you. Apologies, I now understand what you mean about me having it back to front and can now move the spawn point using the method/trigger event Devoss mentioned. But I wanted to see what the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' check box actually did when checked - as this was what was confusing me. Sorry this is long winded but would appreciate your thoughts - I place a single mp AH-94 (me) on an airfield helipad - this is in stable editor. I don't check the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box in the Ah-94 unit settings - and I don't  choose any waypoint in the edit scenarios - RTB Waypoint option to set Nav RTB button. Go into game - airborne - press RTB in Nav MFD - nothing comes up - as expected. I then check the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box in the AH-94 unit settings - assuming this means - whatever the spawn point is for this unit that is what will show in the Nav screen as the RTB point? - start mission - airborne - get well away from spawn - press RTB in Nav screen - nothing appears. Back to editor - leave 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box checked in AH-94 unit settings and add waypoint to the edit/scenario RTB Waypoint - one well away from the airfield. Start mission - airborne - hit RTB button in NAV MFD and it shows path to waypoint I set in edit/scenario/ RTB Waypoint modal. What should checking the 'RTB Waypoint is Spawn' box do? - and should it override any waypoint in the edit/scenario/RTB waypoint modal - because in the test scenario it didn't.
Do the MP Spawn unit properties have an RTB waypoint too? I know there's one in the scenario options for SP missions
No - just the check box.

Do the MP Spawn unit properties have an RTB waypoint too? I know there's one in the scenario options for SP missions
No - just the check box.
I would expect that if that tickbox is ticked, when the player belonging to that spawn point presses the RTB button on NAV, it'll set their waypoint to be their spawn point

whats the best way to make an air raid siren play on an airfield during mission start, but have it fade away when taking off and flying away?

this amount of drones

you know the "the island" campaign for the AV42?
yeh
kinda like that, but we never left on that carrier and stayed on the island to watch the show

how to i make the drones attack?
Did you equip them with weapons?
I think you have to manually set it for each drone otherwise they spawn with no weapons and fly around like a headless chicken

i know that you can change the equipment of standalone mantas, but is their a way to change equipment of mantas in the carrier?

i know that you can change the equipment of standalone mantas, but is their a way to change equipment of mantas in the carrier?
no, carrier-launched mantas only have their guns
are you sure the carrier and/or drones has "Engage Enemies" checked?

are you sure the carrier and/or drones has "Engage Enemies" checked?
Drones can't carry A2A missiles anyways, AFAIK
There’s no way to order the drones to do anything, as they don’t exist in the mission editor. They’ll auto aggro on enemies if they get close enough

i assume there is no way to change the  status of a unit out of being invincible, but instead we should use the "destroy" action?
when we want to emotionally loose a wingmen
hmm ... every time I try to upload a campaign (only 3 missions) I get this ... "Upload error! LimitExceeded"
I reduced all pics to small file size and used very limited objects, objectives, waypoints etc ... but still   No Joy !!

all your pics are under 1mb?
yes
hmmm

one MB each or all combined ?
each
Check  OK I will try your idea

If a unit is set to follow a path that it isn't spawning  directly ontto, will it first move towards the first point in the path, or will it "merge" onto the path closest point/segment?
The closest point

A month+ in the making, after lots of bug fixes, testing with random people and listening to a lot of feedback, the first mission of my campaign is complete :tick: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2794716816
The 2nd mission is probably going to have at least 1 enemy player in a jet, excited to set all that up
Is there any options for events trigerred by player by like the comms menu? I would love to see another category of comms as "Other" or something in which mission makers can put their own triggers

I have a question about objective info and how that's presented in your objective mfd page in game. I've got an objective where you need to destroy a number of hostile units, however not all of them are spawned in right away and will be spawned throughout the objective. Will the objectives mfd page only show you the count of targets that have spawned, incrementing the count as more spawn in? Or does it also show you the unspawned ones too as a total count of units to destroy?

It will include unspawned units. Unspawned units are considered alive until spawned in and destroyed.
If you want the total number to be dynamic, you have to use a conditional objective.

Is there way to make a unit "un-invincible"  after its been set as invincible? Currently, I only see an option to set unit as invincible.
how would you change the required number dynamically using conditional triggers?
Well, you can't change the counter dynamically. But if you're willing to forfeit the unit counter then it's just a matter of setting up the right condition tree.

Alright, I think i've got an idea of what to do from here. Thanks for the help!

If your objective's start mode is set to 'Triggered' but it's also set to 'Required', will it still be required to be completed for mission success if left untriggered?
Nope. The mission ends when all **active required** objectives are completed. Inactive required objectives are ignored.
If you're making use of that you have to be extra careful that the next required objective is activated before the previous required objectives are completed, or else the mission will end early.

I have a convoy of units, i've set up their path, formation is set to column, but when they go on bridge only the first unit in group is *on* the bridge, the rest is in the water below. Any ideas on how to fix that? How can you make a convoy not drive under the bridge?
I, uh, "fixed" that in one of my missions by making the units *not* a group, so they don't try to create a formation at all. Just a bunch of units individually following a path that all happen to be in a line. XD
does the "PreReqs" start mode for an objective require all of the ticked objectives to be finished, or only one? i ant to have multible pick up objectives, that all come together at a single drop off obj

does the "PreReqs" start mode for an objective require all of the ticked objectives to be finished, or only one? i ant to have multible pick up objectives, that all come together at a single drop off obj
no wait i can just set the mode to trigger and start the dropoff by having each pickup trigger it
It requires them all to be completed

i assume the "completed event" action triggers once an event is completed?
i just set each of the pick up objectives to trigger the drop off one individually
For an objective, the Completed event actions are performed after the objective is completed

a mission can be completed if there are untriggered and unfinished obj left?
Yup
A mission completes if there's no active objectives left

i i force quip a loadout, can the player land and rearm to get a new loadout?
No
oh

What would be stopping that if you gave them free access to all weapons?
i want the equip they spawn with to be forced and a specific one, but then be able to choose their own later
I'm reasonably sure you can't do that. If you give them the ability to choose a loadout, they'll get the loadout screen when they start the mission, and will be able to pick anything you've allowed there

Hmmm .. strange placement of mobile ground units in rendered game.  I made a small island with city painted fairly dense and put many copies of SAAW, and other Mobile forces into radius roaming patrols and when I tested the mission it worked well but when I tested it through the MP lobby some units were misplaced in the water. I did have apposing units overlapping in some areas and thought that might be the case so I decide on a neutral zone and deleted all units inside. It seems to have fixed the issue but could use more testing. Wondering if bug or feature ?
Ground units in the water is always a bug
they were fishfood for sure. I tried to fly out and search but could not see anything. they did show up on the Nav though.

Max players in one lobby is 16 so that means a pvp mission can be 8v8 max or 16 on each team so 16v16?
16 total
Nvm found that in scenario info tab 😛

No, but you don't need VR stuff installed to use it
Once you've agreed to the EULA, there's buttons on the sitting-in-the-carrier-bridge scene to access the mission editor and map editor on your pancake display that you can click on with the mouse

How are player callsigns designated with the multicrew helicopter MPspawns. Is it like, Alpha 1-1 and Alpha 1-2 in helo #1, and Alpha 1-3 and Alpha 1-4 in helo #2?
alpha 1-1 is the designation for an aircraft so pilot and gunner would both be alpha 1-1
that's actually ideal, awesome

Do the drone carrier launches the drones it has on its deck, or is it just for show?
they can actually deploy, they are not just for show
I had one set-up in a scenario and set to engage enemy, but it didn't (before it got taken out by my wingman)

Can AI F-45 do short takeoff from the attack carrier? It seems it just taxi to it and stay there (wings still up)
You can use R to skip putting on the helmet, but you must set the scenario to no customization.  Once in, use Insert to pop into debug cam, [ and ] to swap units. Tab toggles a simple gun to shoot things with.  It's more just for mission testing purposes
I noticed this issue on my modded carriers. They taxi forward but get stuck mid turn and fail to completely take off. It's like 50/50 if they manage to take off or not

Is that on the vanilla Wasp LHD? If so, it might be a bug with the F-45s ability to STOL
Cause, afaik, the AV-42 doing STOL worked every time
Both modded and vanilla

I set a path on a highway, but the vehicles set to use that path will not move. Any suggestion to what could be the reason?

if you have a bunch of vehicles in the same group, can ypu just set the lead one for a path and have the other verhicles set to "follow"? Not the case with the issue I was reporting above

Honestly I forget if that works. The most reliable way to make them move in formation is to use an action to tell the **group** to path.
Thanks @Sypwn , I will try that

What's the range on the DMS Cruiser's SAM turrets and radar?
Id have to calculate per-aircraft to get radar range, the SAM will fire at 14.5km
But, the RIM-67B isn't a very good missile, its fairly easy to dodge

how do you switch focus on units in the dev cam?
`[` and `]`
oh crap those are diffrent on german keyboards

why are my units not getting destroyed when i set them to? They are invincible, but only because i want them to die at a certain point and not earlier. I have at least two examples of units just not exploding when commaned
Invincible probably prevents it.
it didnt in my last few tests though...

they can also crash into a mountain anddie that way, because they went 1000m off course of the path i set them to follow. why mountains but not the power of god himself?
cant do that. can only set them as invincible, not the other way around
Just uncheck the box and I think that'll do it

oh that action changes the status?
neat
do the explosions that are part of death animations also deal damage like ordanance to nearby units?

What is the max effective range of the MPA-155 artillery? The wiki lists max range for the RAT but not the MPA-155.
Unlike the RAT,  I don't see a hard coded maximum engagment range, the bullets can exist for 2 minutes before self detonating traveling at 510 m/s (I think)
So quick math would say it should be able to fire at a 45 degree angle for a range of 26.3km

wait do bullets have air resistance in vtol?
I have no idea
noe

It's kind of like being a meat eater. You could think about all of the pain, suffering and hard decisions that go into meat production (or military engagements)  But why do that to yourself? 😉
Wasn't 30 degrees optimal firing angle for range?
depends if you include air resistance

Wasn't 30 degrees optimal firing angle for range?

As bullets don't have resist in vtol,  best is 45

Does the mission maker have a trigger to clean up dead units in an area? I wonder if that would help with the CPU melting at Charlie sector on dyn lib?
Nope, lol
I've asked for it

If a group lead unit has alternate spawn location, will they also be applied to the rest of the group? If not, how do you set up an alternate spawn identical point for a whole group?
If you set a unit's group set then there's an extra check box in the Alt Spawn tab called "Sync Group" that does exactly what you want.
ah, that's what it is for. Great. Thank you

so, you have to have alt-spawn for each unit in the group, right?
Yes, if the number of alt-spawns don't match then it will automatically add extra alt-spawns to lacking units until they do. But those extras will all have default properties.
do i have to sync-group for each unit or just the lead?

do i have to sync-group for each unit or just the lead?
checking it for one checks it for them all
i see. that make sense

Hi Sypwn - could you just clarify how the alt spawn weighting works. If I have say just one other alt spawn - so two in total - to get a 50/50 chance of either being used do I set them both to 100 (as Spawn 1 defaults to 100) or do I set spawn 2 to 50?.
You set them both to 100

Is there a way to loop events in the mission editor? I'm trying to figure out a way to make a sneaky SAM battery that only lights up its radar for thirty seconds at a time.
The only workaround I found was really, really stupid.
No way to do loops, your best option is to copy and paste the events a few hundred times

That event trigger will only happen once right?
Oh, will it? I was hoping it could happen repeatedly.
it was my understanding that basically all events/triggers can only happen once

If you kill-all a group, do they disappear or just burst into flame/explode/die?
They burst into flames
They’ll even do death radio calls if they’re in your group

Will units follow roads preferentially do do I need to make the path very explicit?
Ground units have no path finding at all
So if I want a tank to follow a road, I have to put their path very explicitly on the road

Is there a way to convert singleplayer scenarios to multiplayer?
The testing cycle for MP missions is insane.  In SP you can just go right into testing.  In MP you have to go through the lobby first
If you are the creator yes

and what about the other way around, convert from MP to SP so I can test faster?

in both directions

they're up on that hill
They're firing clean over the road and landing in the lake

maybe there's an on-death event?
Events can only fire once
not that i have found.

Is there any talk of allowing some kind of scripting? LUA, python, or even c# for the editor?
oh man, if each event can only fire once then you can't even do territorial tug of war
everything can only START as one side and flip over to the other side once

What's the best way to take fully rendered screenshots for mission briefs? anyone got any pro tips? Only thing is know to do is fly by screenshots which is a bit of a pain and makes muh image quality.
When you spawn in, you can press the insert key on your keyboard to activate a debug camera, letting you move around the map at will and freely take screenshots
(this is done on the flatscreen and not in VR)

nice to have a tool for debugging missions too though, already has been useful quite a bit.   Also, does anyone know of a good way to detect which alt spawn a unit is at? ive tired using the conditional editor with the (unit) near waypoint, and it doesn't seem to work sadly
> ive tired using the conditional editor with the (unit) near waypoint, and it doesn't seem to work sadly  This is exactly how I do it. It works for me.
Note that "Unit near waypoint" and "UniltList any near waypoint" seem to give different results sometimes. I think one is spherical distance and the other is cylindrical.

Hmm, I'm only using "Unit near waypoint" and cranked up the radius to ensure it was in the area with no luck. The only thing I can think that might be different is that my unit spawns immediately, although I did try with a 6s delay with no luck either. I'll have to do some more trouble shooting. Maybe it has to do with it being a multi part navel unit somehow? Or that it spawns too soon?
This is the logic I'm using that doesn't seem to work, is this at all different then what you use?
That looks fine. Can you jump in voice chat and show me around more of the mission?

ugh
They’ll not fire again until their previous missile is resolved

Technically if the carrier is stationary you might be able to? Not sure if it will spawn you grounded in that situation.

How would you setup for a unit to randomly pick one path or another? Two different events each with a chance node in the conditional? But then there's always a chance it won't pick either ...
Conditional actions are what you’re looking for. Check out the System event action category

Make sure you don't have the option checked that requires previous missions completed before you can do the next one. I *think* that still exists in MP "campaigns"?
This also, though
That tickbox doesn’t do anything, or possibly even exist, for mp campaigns

Hey! I'm working on my first mission. and I thought it would be cool to have a civilian faction on the map, that if too many died a fail state would happen, have devs ever talked about adding a neutral faction?

is it possible to make a mission (singleplayer or multiplayer) where you can play exclusively as REDFOR?
The ones without a waypoint are likely heading to (0,0)
the game won't let me publish a multiplayer campaign mission that doesn't have at least one BLUFOR player spawn

is that just a bug?
You might have answered your own question there
Not sure if it’s intended, but if that’s how it is, that’s how it is

What if you create a BLUFOR spawn, but set the team size to 0?
whats an orbit point
a point to orbit

how do i set the orbit point?
and yeah, ai planes
ohh

what happens to an ai plane if it's given now orbit point or path?
You mean *no* orbit point or path? In that case it will use its own spawn point as a fallback orbit point.
Oh ok, thank you

Can a campaign have more than one map?

Can a campaign have more than one map?
yes
you just have to select a new map when you are at this menu.

If one updates a workshop campaign, does it get automatically updated to everyone that downloaded it (when they start VTOL VR)?
after testing
I have found that more aircraft than player slots are available

hey does anyone know how to automatically despawn enemies after an objective is completed?
yeet them out of existance
you can delete them by exploding them

like setting a kill all command when the objective is completed?
i just dont want a ton of dead stuff killing the fps
It's probably much better for your CPU to kill them than to keep them alive

do they phase through like jettisonned weapons?
Is there a timer as well? Iv killed AI on the ground and a few seconds later they vanish
Chase

Quick question: if I make a multiplayer campaign where it's 2 aircraft carrier groups vs each other and one of the enemy carriers get sunk, will the players who were assigned to that carrier automatically spawn on the other carrier? Or will they be lost in purgatory?
Nope. I think they will die on spawn if that part of the carrier is flooded. You can use a trigger to move the spawn point when the carrier sinks, but it has to be to a static air or ground location, not on a carrier. Or you could create enough spawn points on both carriers and let them sort it out in the lobby. Alpha = carrier 1, Bravo = carrier 2, and cap the team size.
how do I finalize the mission. I can't seem to find a command for ending, or final etc... Does it just know?

how do I finalize the mission. I can't seem to find a command for ending, or final etc... Does it just know?
If there are no more active objectives left, then the mission ends in success.
If there are no more **required** objectives left.

Any suggestions to what could be causing that?
A weird path. Weird terrain around the point they get stuck. Unusual method to order them to follow the path. Random chance
I’m still very new to the editor. Struggling with making ground AI work. But it could be all the units try following the exact same point and end up clipping. Could test the follow behavior on some of them

Are they actually in a group? How are you telling them to follow the path?
Yes. I have a timed event that set the path for them to follow
If you watch them when the timed event fires, what do they do?

If you watch them when the timed event fires, what do they do?
I assume they start off not in a tactical blob. Do they vanish, or move underground, or start humping?
I don’t know, it’a far out from the player spawn point

I assume they start off not in a tactical blob. Do they vanish, or move underground, or start humping?
I don’t know, it’a far out from the player spawn point
Move it temporarily for testing, or use the insert debug camera

Does the objective have a waypoint set? Does it have the auto set waypoint tick box ticked?
Ah auto set waypoint was off. Cheers
it works in mp

What is the best resolution for the mission and campaign images?
Campaign image must be below 1MB to be allowed to upload to workshop. Other than that, as high as you can go.
Awesome. Thank you for the quick reply

If one set  the objective type to "land" in a MP mission. Will that mean that all players have to land, or just whoever land first there complete the objective?
I think it may have been my "command" to set the formation to "column" that caused that issue. I eventually changed the role of that group to not roaming around, otherwise, they were moving as they should (after not setting the formation), but some where driving on the roof of the houses (the path is in a city)
Any player on that team.

how do you lauch a mission from the mission editor with the quest 2?
I just have to start the game through air link. Go to the editor then on your pc launch scenario
ok. thanks. it wont work on a multiplayer scenario for some reason

"Missions" don't spawn. Are you talking about units? Or player spawns?
Units have a built-in feature called "alt spawns" that do exactly what you want.
Thanks I’ll take a look at that!

is there a trick to this?
What are you trying to do?
And do you have any static objects to do things to?

thats the only one i know of

You have a oilrig in your mission?
No oil rig, i thought i could spawn a crashed av42 when a mission triggered
a layer system would be dope yea

Oh so enemy units still pop up if detected?
Good to know

How do I delay the initial radio message. It usually plays as I'm spawning in and clips out the first part of it

is there a way to spawn in a refueling point after an objective is finished?
it does not have the "spawn immediatly" box to untick
on a simular note, is there a way to kill or disable a rearming point?

I want to have actual ground crew my wingmen has to drop off at the fob. I dont want the real Spot to be active before the crew is on the ground, and want it to be disabled if all of them die.
But I can't spawn it in later or kill it.

what would be the next best thing then if i want a FOB that is depenend on certain factors, but dont want an airbase? next to beggin baha to add those propertires to respawn points
There are no other options. Players can rearm at airbases, carriers/cruisers and rearm points. I guess the carriers/cruisers are your next best option
You can spawn something else on the fob to physically block it, such as a tent or a bunker.

also is it a known bug that it wont allow me to change the images on my campaigns and missions?

What region did you say the server was in? If possible id recommend looking at moving the server to Europe or America, I wouldn't be suprised if some of the issues you've had are due to region specific issues in a less-popular area
The server provider is based in Greece, though I've seen it connect from Finland as well
It wasn't just my bot that was having issues, everyone in the discord developer servers was freaking out

i have done my best to accomedate the stupidity of ground units by giving them a very nice and detailed path in the center of a road to follow, and yet half of the vehicles get stuck when trying to get into the colloum formation (wich i already placed them in), and the other half drives along the edge of the road at a 45° angle. what else am i supposed to do?
Don't put them in a group and just have them individually follow the path.
ah yes. 20 actions for objective complete trigger

also, how to not have the carrier formation fuck up upon mission start? for some reason it always wants a cruiser to be the lead ship. looks shit if the player is taking off and sees all the ships clusterfucking each other for the lead spot
The formation is based on the order in which you add them to the group. Lead, then rear left, then rear right, continuing left right left right
So remove them all from the group and add them back in that order

i assume same with vehicles?
Probably? Never used vehicle formations myself
where do I get VTEdit?

Dyn Lib uses 99% default actions. @Green can you post a pic of the unit's properties window? Also, use Path , not Railpath
How much of DynLib has land unit groups moving in formation?
If they are starting and moving in a line like that, they don't need formation.

Unless you want them to stop and re-form when a unit dies

How are they moving instead? Screenshot would be excellent
alright, give me a moment
@Skumby they move like this, clipping through buildings

Doesn't column form them up in 2 columns?
I don’t think so, but there’s plenty of options there! One for every occasion

uhhh
C talked me into the thought 2 hours ago

does the airbase start out as enemy? otherwise i doubt the bombers will be able to taxi
save, close and restart the editor
itsa know bug. after that, they should show up

what are you using to tell the bombers to take off? events, objectives? trigger?
triggers
conditional

is their path free? arethey placed weirdly?
they're placed like this
can i see the units page of the bombers?

can i see the units page of the bombers?
i think bombers are too large for the tents.
i might be wrong, but if the ai does not think it hasenough space, it wont taxi. try placing them somewhere else

but how do I make it trigger if they detect a plane?
like this?
By team enemy

What do you wish to do when the RADAR sees them?
Need to break the debug up into two parts
Stick a System -> Tutorial Message in that event's actions too

but how do I set up the logic??? what cinditions do I use?
With your current conditions you have
add 2 events that fire both when the RADARs detect and when the bombers take-off

how do I do that system tutorial message?
like this?
yes

and will the message be displayed to both players?
or only 1?
to all players

both types of infantry are allowed right?
Ye
nice

how many infantry can be carried?
8
oooh

Is it possible to make a resuply point spawn when infantry enters an area?
I cant make it start despawned
No

oh  what about if I switch the airfields team? will we be able to resuply on the airfield then?
Yes, at the usual locations
The pads and the hangars

whats the range on rocket artillery?
And does in increse if theyre high up?
very far

And does in increse if theyre high up?

how do I get them to target an aproaching ship?
If they see it they will target it
You can set the ship as a priority target via events

can they use an AWACS radar tp target?
Although Im not sure how good rocket arty is against carriers
no

what about the other kind of artillery?
RADARs can datalink with planes, so can ships im pretty sure
I thought the artillery had to use waypoints to fire?

Yup. A triggered event
gotcha thank you

applies even if they're single-unit waves?
oh if it's only a single unit then yeah doesn't matter
gotcha

ah ok, so even if 'start immediately' is ticked, the parameter will still need to be met for it to actually trigger?
yes, the conditions must always be met to advance the sequence
alright sick, thanks again

Is there a condition you can specify that AI will not fire at you until X time has passed?  It'd be nice to create a 1v1 guns mission where they don't shoot on the merge
You can set them to not engage, but then they won't manoeuvre to engage you either
Then use a timed event to turn them back to engage later

Could you set a path?
Always
example, hot spawn your craft about 20 seconds from the merge

Is there a way to have aircraft automatically take off and engage ships detected by an AWACs?
you can order them to take off
and set a default waypoint on the spawn to go to the ships

if I set a path for bombers that passes close too the ships, will they target them too?
should

Hello, this is my first mission/map so bear with me. I have found that it takes ages to load (sometimes more than 30 min). Some kind map designers (don't remember names, just I know one made dynamic liberation) told me it could be an issue with cities taking up too much CPU space on loading. I want to take this project seriously and am open to any and all suggestions. Here is the Steam Community page for the mission: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2815386580 Edit: since the linked file was uploaded, I have reduced the size of the cities and removed irrelevant ones, which helped load times.

if you make a mission in Public Testing, will it just become unavailable in later versions?
Any time that question is asked people say "yes", but in my experience no. I've even played 1.4.4 missions that use the new MAD-4 missile in 1.4.3 just fine.
Oh, I assume you mean "earlier versions"

like, if I were to make a mission with the PT editor, would that not be transferrable to the main game once v1.4.4 comes out on the main branch?
Oh, that will definitely work

Is it possible to have/do global variable persist between missions in a campaign?
No
I hope we can get that one day, that would make more dynamic campaign possible

hey where do i make a map multiplayer? I looked at what other ppl where saying answering this question before but I don't see the checkbox
The map itself is separate from missions you make with it
When making a campaign, there is a checkbox to make it mp-only

ohh u have to make it a campaign?
Yes, unfortunately standalone missions are not supported yet
That being said, you can just make a campaign of 1 mission

other question is there a team b based tanker?
no but both teams are able to refuel from it i think
Is anyone else having issues with the conditional editor either not selecting nodes or changing everything with conditional to the same thing?

Is anyone else having issues with the conditional editor either not selecting nodes or changing everything with conditional to the same thing?
Hopefully he'll fix it soon. In the meantime, you can make the actual objective type something impossible ("land" with no waypoint set should work) then use conditional events to complete the objectives.
It can probably also be fixed directly in the .vts file but I don't recommend trying that until you get pretty familiar with the rest of the editor.

N00b question: how do you make a limited respawn MP mission?
you can check mpdeath or mpspawn get killed to increment global var
At that’s what it is for. Thanks

but how do you prevent it from respawning?
put them in jail
... or is it just decrease a variable and fail all objectives once that number reach 0

do I have to restart the game or something?
I’d like to see a built in way to set the numbers of available aircraft and the numbers of available weapons for a whole campaign
The number of respawns/tickets available is doable with the in-game logic already

But does anyone know how to fix this?
Did you try quitting and reopening the campaign? The error states the campaign name and description are invalid.
But they look fine on the left.

Yes, definitely a kludge though. But no way to limit weapons quantities

No
Maybe

Yo, got a boatload of questions being that I started making maps and using mods since legit 2 days ago. Would I be able to get some help?
Yup
OK good looks, lemme just write this all out gimme like 2 mins

OKay deff found help with what I watned, but still have some questions. First off, will wingmen actually speak to the player in a playtest, being that they haven't at all even when set to player commands. Second, I want to basically hand-hold the player into taking control of a squadron upon takeoff by using the PTT comms feature, but I can't seem to get the tutorial messages to fire in order just like the in-game tutorial. Do I have to seperate each of the messages into different events and then make them fire each other after time delays? Thirdly, the (System - Play BGM) feature just doesn't seem to work. I hit the test button and nothing happens, and of course in playtest nothing happens. I know it's a playable audio bc I have it as a custom MP3 in my planes themselves.
Yes, yes, yes
VTOL VR is fussy about the MP3 files it accepts

yea see I have three unit groups, each of them for each player that spawns in one of those three squads. upon takeoff I'm trying to have the game tell them (With a radio message) that they are commanding that squad, to which the tutorial messages goes over the thumbstick and says "Use PTT to command ___ squad" and then a quote on the cockpit windshield says "Wingmen, form up." However, I'm getting the radio message and the "form up" message, which is making me think all three messages are indeed firing, but only the last one is being displayed. So would I just have the first message fire, wait x amount of seconds, then have a separate event fire the next message after that amount of time?
Also, the wingmen aren't speaking, dk why but
Ah. Wingmen don't work in MP

I though Baha sorted that before weekending off into the sunset?
he did?

Can someone advise how I make a respawn loop?  I've got a trigger condition of "unit is not alive", and set the unit.  Next I want the new unit to spawn in the same place, but it isn't doing it at all? Does it spawn in a random place? I say this because the map is....quite large.
Units can only spawn once. Events can only fire once
Ok, so I have to just keep adding units and triggers?

Ok, so I have to just keep adding units and triggers?

how do I allow all Vehicles to be used by the player?

I get that not every building can be destructible, but a couple infrastructure targets would be interesting. Maybe: power plant (lights in city go dark?),  Enemy hideout (small simple building), radio/communications node.   Add a couple civilian vehicle types and the possibilities would go up a lot.
A very good way around it right now is creative interpretation
Plop down a few farm buildings for a water treatment plant, shove a bunker where the control room or something explosive like a flocculation building would be

Can ANY building besides a bunker be destroyed?
tents, bunkers, oil rigs (the feet, the tower and another part I forgot)
Gotcha.  Thank you

To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Is there a way to have surface to air radars turned off until an event happens?
yes, uncheck the "Engage enemies" box. you can have an event that will set them to engage enemies and they will turn on radar and then start looking for things to shoot
Quick thing ya'll: I have an allied fleet consisting of an aircraft carrier, assault carrier, and a few cruisers. All of them are set to different paths like in the adivce I gave bro above^^ However, for some reason my rightmost carrier just decided to put on Deja Vu and always consists on drifting into the whole fleet like he went AWOL. he's set to a default of navving a path but doesn't want to, and I even traded him out for a regular carrier thinking it was the ship type that was bugged. Could it be that he's only carrying F45s and there's some random behavior idk ab these ships?

oh hadn't spotted that yet, thank

Honestly is there anything they did not do to the 130? It's a troop and cargo transport, gunship, apparently carrier capable and now they strap rockets on it. Why not just retire every other airframe and just use this plane as your alrounder
Also sorry but no lol  Check out the NotBDarmory mod though, it actually let's you rocket boosters to your aircraft.
Also can drop cruise missiles

Does the SAAW not engage munition threats like HARM’s?
I can’t seem to get it to engage incoming missiles
SAAW is a fairly low tech/small unit, it’s radar is likely incapable of intercepting missiles

If missile intercepting is needed, dosnt AAA do that job better?
It’s static though
Does the enemy get a AAA truck? I thought it was only the allies that had it

Does the enemy get a AAA truck? I thought it was only the allies that had it
If you need mobile, MAD4 works
Well can’t shoot and move at the same time

Is the missile controlled by the radar unit? because would adding more radars solve the limited engagements
More radars would fix yeah
You’d need more launchers tho, iirc a launcher can only have one radar

How would I configure it to prioritize missiles?
Yeah one TEL can only engage a single target at a time
One TEL to one radar does allow multiple missiles to a target but I’ve yet to figure out how to designate one to target missiles because they only seem to target my aircraft

Hi all! Just started learning how to do mission today cause i just love this game and always thought it could be so much more with a scenario i have in mind since launch , but that i've never find online yet. So i just raised up me sleeve and dive right in, and i must say.... god! didnt thought it was a tool so well made, simple and yet so powerfull!!! But i got some question for the veteran mission builder. Is there a place somewhere in the editor where i can use static objet (like dock, house or scenario thing) to use in some event?
yea! 😛
What do you mean "use in some event"?

What do you mean "use in some event"?
You can place different types of static options either in the map or in the mission.
like if a unit is near a dock for x time, start a event

didnt remember but... is the scenary object destructable?
Only the oil rig
another one ... is new unit in the game moddable? like introducing a new type of building or such?

another one ... is new unit in the game moddable? like introducing a new type of building or such?
With mods, yes. https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/7ekcqp7f/
But that means someone will need to be running this mod to play your mission.

so cannot upload to the workshop "fire and forget" without telling to player to download the package i presume?
Do I have any means of duplicating a mission so I can make 2 slightly different versions of it?
save as

Epic, thanks

will not-yet-spawned units induce as much lag as spawned units? will killing them also reduce lag?
1no, 2yes
sweet, thanks

Anyone know what a negative kill score means for a player in a multi-player game? (e.g. -40)
teamkills
although I've seen it glitched, once I got something like -70 even though the infantry I was shooting at was definitely the enemy

couple question for you guy.... 1-Is it possible to offer the possibility (in sp mission) to the player, to choose his plane at mission start? if so, how? 2- In a campaign , can we use some data of the previous mission in the next (like global number variable or X plane left in the previous mission) to include in the start of the new one? 3- i know its a dumb question but.... how i im supposed to put a player spawn point? didnt find the info anywhere! :\
No, no, it's in the player category
ok thanks!

will an unspawned unit still count as "near waypoint" if they are within the zone but not yet spawned?
No
thanks

Is it possible to set up a final condition to make everyone land to end mission not just one player? every thing I try doesn't work
just one
That's a shame, it always annoys me when people leave without landing.

Does this work ? or it only trigger for one player?
I've tried that with all airborne for a take off and it didn't work. I think it needs all of them even if they aren't spawn in
Yeah :/ then its a bug

how do i get a drone carrier to launch it's drones?
Events
I've seen it before in some missions but the ability to spot something on tads and it will trigger an event, how is that done?

NVM figured it out.
mission editing is rough... especially since I want so much to have voice lines...

q: how do i make mobile artilery shoot a unit group?
You can only make them arty waypoints, I believe
okay thx

... if I try to upload to steam, it says "map must be packed" ...?
have you edited the map?
No, but now it looks like the whole map is gone ... WTF?

have you edited the map?
No, but now it looks like the whole map is gone ... WTF?
so you cant access this button in the mission editor.

so you cant access this button in the mission editor.
Problem is that I can't get into the editor with that scenario, but I guess I can do it with another scneario

was the directory named differently?
No, it was the same. I don't know why deleting some mission within the campaign also deleted the map ... possibly a bug
weird.

Any mission editors know how to set up protect objectives on a group of ships?
I have the ships in a sea group already
but the protect obj seems to be one unit only?

but the protect obj seems to be one unit only?
I'd use a conditional objective instead
can you leave the success field empty?

can you leave the success field empty?
ah looks like you can
thanks

will any of the enemy AI planes attack friendly ships?
the bombers and the UAVs don't seem to want to do it
Yes, if you give them air-to-ground weapons. Rockets or bombs.

How do you give an attack order?
You can add them as designated targets
They are automatically revealed to the AI and they will immediately go toward it and attack it, stopping at nothing

is that done by setting the objective for team b and then designating each of the targets?
You use events. There are actions for each unit to "set priority target" and "set designed target" IIRC
ah fantastic, thanks

First timer here, how does setting up PVP missions work? I got the campaign and map and everything, but the enemy team can't use the friendly team's units including the playable vehicles, so how would I set up spawns for both teams?
Ah, I see the player tab now
What's the max amount of players one scenario can have?

What's the max amount of players one scenario can have?
16
Do I need to do anything specific objective wise for a simple team deathmatch mission

How would one do that?
Uhhhh good question, I haven't used the pvp features of the editor
😅

do the bombers ever attack more than 1 target? Or do they blow their wad on one and then dip?
nope
they have either 4 x 32  or 4x16 bombs by default i think

What happens when you try?
whenever i try to edit this screen shows up
the loading never stops

https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/985344677404364800 Does this sound like something you've done? I've seen a couple of reports like this issue recently, where before there was none
yes thats exactly what i did
Exciting

Have you ever repacked a map in the scenario editor?
@Warbuc06 ^
yes

How did you repack it when you weren't able to load the map in the editor?
the stuff in the top left corner was still interactable
in my screenshot you can see that the tabs are still there

The mission(s) you deleted - were they the only ones using that map?
yes
all of them used the same map

So your campaign had a load of missions that used one map, and some other missions that used other maps?
i only had one other mission in the campaign and it used the same map it was also the first in the campaign order when i deleted it
Open `...\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\<Your Campaign Name>` It contains all the scenarios and maps that your campaign uses See if you can see which map is missing Then goto `...\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomMaps` and copy the missing map into your campaign directory

Does ScenarioTest#1.5 use the Korengal map?
yes
thats the one ive been trying to load

... ok. What's in the Korengal_1725346568 directory?
Ok. Gonna have another go at reproducing this
Ok, so when I create a scenario with that map, I get extra bits in my map folder that you don't have

so i need to replace them?
Still checking - I really want to make this break
alr

Nope. Can't. Steam workshop download is in `Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\667970\1725346568` . What do you see in that directory?
Is what the map directory in my campaign looks like
So you need to copy `height.pngb` to the map directory in your campaign directory

And maybe you'll be sorted then?
ill try it
so i went to the file to copy height.pngb but now even more is missing

maybe i should replace the entire file?
Sure, but the `WorkshopItemInfo.xml` isn't necessary/might be harmful
ok

@Frenchy Does the above look anything at all like the problem you encountered?
made a new mission in the campaign, attempted to edit ScenarioTest#1.5 and encountered the same issue
it said it had to repair the mission order again

how do i send the entire campaign file?
it says the file type is not supported
You'd put it in a zip file, but don't worry about that until Baha says he wants it

Can you post a log file next time you add a scenario? That's clearly where it's breaking, and I've only seen a log file from when you tried to load the scenario afterwards so far
here you go
i added a third scenario after having no issues with the other two

What's in the campaign map directory? The log's complaining about a missing file again
Yup, it's gone again 😄
why did it load normally this time then

Im curious, would you have those files in a normal scenario too?
The map is inside the scenario directory, rather than the campaign directory, for single scenarios
this is also following my camera in the editor

but you are working in a campaign, right?
The bug is happening in a campaign, yes
can you post your vtm/vts/vtc files? IIrc this has something to do with a weird ID/name miss match

can you post your vtm/vts/vtc files? IIrc this has something to do with a weird ID/name miss match
By normal, do you mean single player?
is this what you are talking about?

By normal, do you mean single player?
is this what you are talking about?
I  had issue with .ogg file being present in a scenario and also a separated  campaign scenario,  failing to play.  Like if the game is indexing everything then use the file, Where ever they are. (removing the single scenario, fixed it in the campaign)

thats one of the files, there should be a few others, specifically a `.vts` file

Sure. Would you find that helpful? It's just a binary mess for me
this is what i have
I can decrypt it if needed

so i just need to change the name to Korengal and it should work?
I would try changing the folder name to just `Korengal` and updating the map IDs to `Korengal`
You said this was a workshop map right?

You said this was a workshop map right?
yes
Has anyone confirmed workshop maps actually *work*? I wouldn't be suprised if the game tries to append the workshop ID to the map ID but isn't correctly updating the internally listed id

Has anyone confirmed workshop maps actually *work*? I wouldn't be suprised if the game tries to append the workshop ID to the map ID but isn't correctly updating the internally listed id
I created two scenarios in a multiplayer campaign using the Korengal map, and it didn't break
Well then I have no idea, the other possibly weird thing is `ScenarioTest1.5` has the ID `ScenarioTest#1.5`

Dunno if that is breaking it?
bruh
all this trouble over a # sign

If i set an alternate spawn weight to 1 will it never happen randomly?
or if it does how do i change player spawn mid-mission
It will have a 1% chance of being used.

i downloaded the map as a free flight, will that be editable in the editor?
or does it need to be a certain file
Sorry?

is there a way to make units fire at something even if they dont have line of sight?
If they're artillery, yes
Otherwise, no

how hard is it to make a 1v1 thing?
Should be pretty easy
i have 0 experience with doing this

ok great, how much stuff would i have to do?
Depends how fancy you want to get
sorry for being a pest, just want 2 planes, any weapons

can i add the other planes from the wiki like the ASF-58?
Yes
And the simple 1v1 mission creep begins 😛

Hey ya’ll. has anybody gotten screwed over for using copyright music in the mission editor? Wanted to add a track but really dnt feel like getting sent to the shadow realm over it
No one has gotten in trouble for it, I believe its *technically* reportable via steam but steam will just take the workshop item down
That would be if someone reports it tho right

One more question: Is it possible for the MP test to actually be played in MP? Like can I get a freind of mine to play the test with me to make sure his side of the story carries out correctly and for balancing reasons? Or is it only solo playtesting
Reason being I do want to try to make a MultiCrew Mod mission, but that involves testing it with MultiCrew actually being used
Just upload it to steam, make the picture something like "**DO NOT USE: WIP**" and boom ur good

"involves testing it with MultiCrew" have we ever played the Desert Door Gunners?
yeah
i don't know if it works

Is there a way in the editor to make, on a "OnEnter" enemy proximity waypoint do an Action on all vehicule who enter it, instead of a specific single unit??
I try to make the enemy, when they reach X waypoint, to move to another waypoint randomly.... but the way i see it in the editor, it look like i have to manually program each single unit in the conditionnal trigger type for it to work, and nowhere it seem like a "batch" unit to choose from
Nope. Events can only fire once

Is there a way to force players to not be able to go above a certain height?
yes
I have no idea how

is there a way to make multiple possible RTB areas? I have 2 cruisers that are potential RTB's each of them field a different MP vehicle.
I would preffer if there was a way to tell each person to go back to their own cruiser.
much thanks, I'll see if my current iteration for it works. I want it to be an or so whoever makes it back first finishes it.

how do you take a conditional objective that if failed is mission failure but there's not really a completion criteria to complete on actual mission success?
You can just not have any logic for the completion
but then the mission will not complete porperly or am i missing something?

but then the mission will not complete porperly or am i missing something?
it is several targets that cannot be destroyed the entirety of the mission or its mission failure.
truing to figure out how to get it clear at the end or just only count as critical if destroyed.

thats full out coding isn't it?
not exactly
Just mildly advanced scripting lol

is there another workaround for it?
It doesn't have to be that complex. If it's as simple as "don't let this happen", then once you complete the final objective in the mission, just set it to complete this objective
e.g. Objective 1, don't let your carrier sink -> fails if your carrier is destroyed Objective 5 (final), destroy the enemy HQ's bunker -> on completion, set objective 1 to succeed

do I use the actual name you put on the objectives?
Obj 1 = don't destroy X target, begins on start Obj 2 = go to waypoint, begins on start Obj 3 = blow up thing, begins on completion of Obj 2 Obj 4 = RTB, begins on completion of Obj 3, on completion it completes Obj 1
all the other objectives work fine, I just need an objective to lear with the last one of the mission.

I forget where it is in the actions menu, I think it might be under system?
just as an event?
But there's an action to complete an objective and it just has you select from the list of all objectives in your mission

how exactly do the Entry and Exit Conditions work for Event Sequences?
You can have it so that when they are detected they die
thats what it is, when they are seen on tads they are killed

I'm trying to remember if I've played that one, is it the one with the convoys stopped on the road?
It has a city of patrolling "allied" units, and you have to spot which ones are secretly the enemy based on their unit types and formation.
Then blow up only those units.

Someone know how i can do a random waypoint? Ive tryed a couple thing but nothing work! What i mean is "if vehicule X arrived at waypoint Y, then it have a 50% chance to go to waypoint A or B"
I don't even think the guy that died died from a missle or gun he crashed I'm pretty sure.
The waypoint's location can't be random, but you can use a Conditional Action and the Chance condition to make a 50/50 chance of telling that unit which waypoint to move to.

you got something you need to say, dragon boi?
:whatChuJustSaid:
yea! now i see! i made exacly what you showed.... but instead i was adding another ELSE IF for the other waypoint!

so for the else i cannot put another 50%? what if a put another loop of the same action?
You technically can, but the actual probabilities are deceptive.
and does the event only happen once or it alway happen if the unit is near the waypoint again?

and does the event only happen once or it alway happen if the unit is near the waypoint again?
Events can only trigger once
really??? fuck! 😦

is it possible to get AI units to jettison their own fuel tanks?
i had to make hundred of event if i want a truly dynamic mission.... a
Not that I can see

Any one knows exactly why negative score happens? I though it was maybe because the players were accidentally destroying allied forces, but I made all allied not able to receive friendly damage and I'm still seeing negative score. Is it because enemy forces are destroying some of the allied forces?
iirc there's a bug where if the host starts a new mission then kills from the first mission get carried over to the next as negative
wouldnt be surprised if it has something to do with switching teams on the next mission

are you restarting the mission at all?
or do the negative scores appear in the middle of the first play through?
no restarting

or do the negative scores appear in the middle of the first play through?
no restarting
ah interesting

Hey guys, what does the "follow function actually for land vehicles? Do I have to designate a target to follow?
Jesus I cant type... I meant to say "What does the 'follow' function actually do for land vehicles?"
I’ve played with it a bit, and have never worked it out

Are there any shared missions that people use as templates? Or that they're willing to share?
Like, your mission got bugged and can't load anymore? Can you PM me the mission files?
like a github?

I think @AtrociousAmbition/Mr. Charisma was working on something like that.

@BurntPineapple is there something you're confused how to do? If you have an idea for a mission you want to make, I can walk you through how to achieve it.
Why does my pick up objective get skipped and the mission completes before I pick up anyone?
Is that objective not set to "Required"?

Does the objective have a "minimum required" slider on the right?

Oh wait It might be because I had it's start mode as triggered instead of prereq
yeah that was it

better for the community no?
ah, yes
nobody is making money here, weird to gate our content

ask the dev? hes literally here in this chat speaking to you
Oh my god it’s the same argument as earlier. Remove control from a creator just because some other people want it to be different :agony:
this man embodies the spirit of open source

How do I make an objective to fly along a path?
You can set a series of waypoints to be followed
and turn on the setting to automatically cycle them

anyone know why my sound files and music files work when i launch from the editor but when I launch my mission from the downloaded multiplayer campaign from the workshop they dont trigger? everything else in the mission works fine

Why is Mobius in B7R? 🤨
It looks like some of the audio files are duplicated in two places for some reason. 1. `\The Round Table\b7r\` 2. `\The Round Table\Example\radioMessages\b7r\`
yeah i think its from before I moved it... might delete the current workshp version and reupload it fresh or smth

are the audio files supposed to also be in CustomScenarios? it won't let me choose from any files other than in EditorResources for the audio files
I assumed they would be copied there, but maybe not. I haven't worked with them in a while.
If they only reside in EditorResources, then yeah try removing the mission from the workshop and re-adding it. Might also want to try re-selecting each audio file in your mission triggers as well.

Do you have that MP mission as a single scenario too?
I’m trying to think of some fun missions to make… anyone have any suggestions?
hmmm i will check but it also isnt playing the background music. checked my voice, bgm, and in game music volume, didnt think about the radio volume

it is an mp scenario in an mp campaign. i copied the audio files from the editorresourcesfolder to the customscenarios folder for the mission too and didnt seem to do anything

is maybe one of these an issue?
these are the 3 places where my audio folder is currently residing for the mission
but i dont have any SP missions with that audio data, its only in these 3 folders

i was gonna use someone else but it never sounded good, glados was the best sounding voice that wasnt a pony?
how many troops can the AV carry?
8

also does all landed only count for occupied units? for mp for example, if only 2 out of 4 people are in a craft, will it need all 4 landed to complete?
thank you
is there anyway to test a MP mission withought uploading it?

so could we get a fast dynm lib with like, 6 players?
and less lag?
Yay I might be able to run that at more than 10 fps

do you know what is causing the lag in the map currently?
mostly the unit counts
is there any golden ratios that get thrown around in terms of how many AI units you can spawn before you start to lag?

it really depends on the hardware, but also the types of units

fighters cause far more cpu use than tanks

@BahamutoD do you have any insight as to what is the biggest resource hog in missions?
ah yes, the 12:40am dev ping
If Baha added some way for the mission triggers to tell the engine "these units won't be used, please permanently delete/unload them from RAM" then I would use it.

somebody has to have tested unit counts before no?

it does somewhat, but not much

how many units does that one have?
There I formatted it a bit more reasonably
oh, my dumbass, thank you

how many units is your new faster map?
on Easy, about 15-20% of the units spawn in
still the same because in that mode you will randomly start outside sector A, B, or C. You just have to clear that one sector to complete the mission.

i7-11700 base clock is 2.5Ghz and boost clock is 4.9Ghz. Where are you getting 3.6 from?

Anybody have any insight to why radio messages only play for the host in a multi-player steam mission, and not anyone else?
How do i make a actual made take off objective in the multiplayer campaign mission im making i dont know how
Not sure what you mean

Can you take a screenshot or two?
I will tmrw im off now
unfortunately no, it check all MP spawn also when not present

Hey folks, I was wondering if there is a good way to display text to all players in a MP lobby when an event triggers. I've been trying to use the tutorial message action but the text only appears on the Host's screen. Is what I want to do possible?
That's an excellent question, I believe text used to display on all screens.
I recommend you report that as a bug in #public_testing or #vtolvrdev

I also tried using a team radio message - which only plays for the host. Is that unusual as well?
I've only used the messages for all players, but that sounds unusual yes
Just to verify. I'm using the System -> Tutorial -> Display Message. Is this what you are also talking about?

Just to verify. I'm using the System -> Tutorial -> Display Message. Is this what you are also talking about?
Yes
That *should* go to all players

alright this may sound a bit odd but how do i update a map?
i've added a few things to my campaign mission but im not entirely sure if it has already updated the map to the workshop
How do I make a takeoff objective for molutplayer campaign

wont that just dupe it?
What sort of takeoff objective did you have in mind
No, it'll update it

For one plane, or some planes, or all planes?
sweet
all planes

So maybe not so much removing the randomness, but making it only one or two cities long?
Yeah, and I just showed you the condition tree to achieve that.
Yes, this is already planned. A version where you only have to complete a single sector.

can anyone help me with chance events? if I want 1 of 5 events to trigger after a unit is destroyed do you set up 5 chance triggers all set to 20% and set them to all trigger on unit death?
Nope, because then you might get more than one of them firing
You want to use conditional actions

ok and how do i make it so you can choose between them in briefing???
You can't
yeah you can

You're doing a multiplayer scenario?
i want to make one yeah
You need to create a multiplayer campaign, then create a scenario inside that

whats the unit of radius ?
Metres
Everything is metres

what does the hull number mean on the ships?
it's its designation set by the mission maker
is the number is 69 or 420 it means that the ship is based otherwise it's just a number

how to set MP player spawn on a carrier?
in the carrier's settings
you can add vehicles to spawn on it in there

only gives me the option of none. is there something i need to do first?
yeah spawn the vehicle/spawn in first
anyone have a tutorial on mission triggers and setting up a custom mission or can help me with it?

yea
can i force an alt spawn and spawn in the same unit at the same time and have the unit spawn at the alt spawn?

Uhhhh, can you reword the question?
basically i want to force a unit to spawn at an alt spawn

Uhhhh, can you reword the question?
basically i want to force a unit to spawn at an alt spawn
so can i spawn in the unit *and* force the unit to have that alt spawn at the same time?

so can i spawn in the unit *and* force the unit to have that alt spawn at the same time?
Yeah, that should work as long as the set alt-spawn action is above the spawn action. Although I haven't tested it.
ok thanks

how do i get the desert camo jets on a mission?
Join team B
i think desert camo skins are bugged

Hey, im new- can anybody tell me how I trigger the 'successful end' of a mission? I have a handful of objectives, and I want my last obj to be to RTB... but then I want the mission to end once the players are on the ground within the radius of the base, alive and stationary.
im happy to hop in a voice channel for this too if that helps..
I don't have the editor in front of me, but there is an objective type of "land" that lets you set a destination waypoint, and an objective start type called "final" or something that makes it the final objective that only shows up after all others are completed.

far as trying to sort of play-test a bit, is the only option for MP to just put it up on workshop and link it to buddies as-is? this game doesn't support like, host can host and the joiners will DL the content... right? (unsure if that makes sense...)
Once you've uploaded it to the workshop, you can open the workshop page for it in steam and change it to "Unlisted". Then the only effective way for others to get it is to have them join your lobby.
Just note that every time you update the mission it will revert back to Public. Which is something I've been meaning to mention to @BahamutoD

but so if i just make it 'unlisted' then whoever joins my private MP lobby will automatically download what they need to play my mission if I'm hosting it?
yep
wicked

@Sypwn you know of any links that could show me how to use global values? i feel like i need them... trying to make an obj where players merely detect a certain number of a total number of enemy stuff...
or trigger... doesn't really matter... just trying to figure out how to do something like that in the conditional logic screen
ex: there are 5 radar stations and 3 SAMs. i want to make a scouting objective 'complete' after the player (or allied AI) detects like 6 things out of 8

ok, so that's how you can use global value? you can just like, tick it up one for every 'true' conditional completion that happens?
im trying to imagine like an 'and-or
i would fire 8 conditional actions upon objective start up

for proximity trigger events in multiplayer missions, does the *Player* option in the *Triggered By* setting respond to just *any* player entering the waypoint radius?
I imagine so
a lot of mission editor stuff is still unoptimized for multiplayer mission making

@Sypwn or anybody else- i might have asked this before... but when pathing ground units such as trucks/tanks, do they sort of automatically prefer to stick to roads if it's loosely the path, or do I need to get VERY precise with my paths?   also, anybody know how the behavior setting 'StayInRadius' works?
There is NO snapping to roads. Your tanks will stick to the path you make...usually.
F

when i make a waypoint, is there a way to cycle through waypoints that have been 'made visible' or whatever? like, can I set a bunch of pre-made waypoints that are points of interest that players would be able to toggle through that aren't related to objectives?
no, outside of the refueling and RTB waypoints
ok, so basically only bases will have waypoints... well, and objectives that you've associated a waypoint with (whether static or a given unit)

does anyone know why I get this error when I clearly have spawnpoints? all the 45's and f16's are MP Spawns
Tastes like mods to me
no mods

Where are the F-16s coming from?
hopeful wishing that the F-26Bs could be F-16s one day
Is it a multiplayer scenario?

yeah, in a campaign
Can you show me a screenshot of the unit properties of one of the MPSpawns?

Also, once you quit, post your player.log here

Did you convert the scenario into a multiplayer one, or has it been multiplayer from the start?
It's been multiplayer from the start
all I've made is campaigns

If you feel comfortable with it, can you zip up your multiplayer campaign and PM it to me? I wanna take it apart
sure, if you want to "steal" it go ahead because I did literally nothing but add the spawns into the map lol
how would I go about zipping up a mission tho?

The directories are in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\CustomScenarios\Campaigns\`
Right click on it, click Compress to ZIP file

Are you getting that error when you try to upload it to the workshop, or when you try to test it?
upload to workshop
but, so I went into the scenario info and set the auto player count back to being enabled and now it seems it wants to let me upload

if I set it to auto balance, does it make it so for every 1 person on blue team, 1 has to be on red?
No. It adds a player slot for each MP spawn, as far as it can
Either you need to have the box ticked, or you need to move the sliders/enter numbers

also, can you tell me what "Hull Number" is for the ships?
It's the giant number painted on the deck and tower
It appears in the comm menu unless you give them a name

@Sypwn figured out the issue with obj completion we had the other night for the last obj- the global value wasn't specified for like, 4/6 of the enemy  targets, so they weren't incrementing it up high enough to complete.   also, is there a way to hide all the HUD when in the editor to take clean screenshots?
iirc there is a camera tool you can use when testing the scenario, i *think* its insert or something to access it but idr
so i just have to launch the mission and actually be in game. balls

Why would they pick up troops?
How would they know which troops to pick up, and where to take them?
Alright

How would they know which troops to pick up, and where to take them?
Alright
I don’t know

what directory is that in? im seeing one in the main top level folder... but it hasn't been updated since like 2 months agoi
nvm found the current version
just getting stuck at 100% load bar.

Could you start the game, try to launch the mission, then quit once it gets stuck and post that log? It’s not close to me which of the errors in that log is the one that’s tripping you up
@Skumby here's what i got
Though it’s super weird that it seems to be going back to the start-up carrier bridge view afterwards

What map is the mission using? One of your own creation?
im trying to make a fly to objective and i noticed this radius properties right here. is there any way to visualize the size of it?
Can't remember if that's the one time you get a circle around it or not

I know it happens for one of them

@Skumby any thoughts as to why it would be trying to return to carrier? this is the second mission save that ive had this happen on. the first time, i thought it was maybe because of paths or triggers that conflicted with AI unit behavior settings or something... it's not the map being updated without being repacked. i know the map isn't inherently broken because I have 2 other missions that I have started on either side of this particular save that still both work.
More missions where Overlord is survival condition?
not in this one. but i did get my overlord survival condition one to work

“Why it would be trying to return to carrier” what do you mean?

“Why it would be trying to return to carrier” what do you mean?
Good. My work here is done
"Though it’s super weird that it seems to be going back to the start-up carrier bridge view afterwards"

Do you see that scene, or does it just stay on the loading screen until you murder it?
just stuck on loading. bar is 100%
If you want, I can take a look at it tomorrow. Zip up the mission folder and pm it to me.

hmm... anybody have any experience with AI bomber? trying to have it fly a path, then when close, trigger it to try to use the 'bomb waypoint' function. it gets within the waypoint trigger proximity, and then just kinda wigs out and flies off in some random direction while throttling up and down and S-curving until it eventually just crashes into the ground
Have you tried trying it to start it’s bombing earlier?
It might be trying to get into a position to start its run, but the start point is behind our inside it our something

may try that. im trying to start from like 18km out

Editor Question: Assault Carriers, what armaments do they have, and what does HULL NUMBER mean?
Hull number is just the number thats written on the boat, its got two ESSM launchers and one CIWS
Its possibly got two different radars, so it might be capable of using both launchers at the same time

Alternate spawn weight, if all left at 100. Game will RNG it?
Yup, they'll all have the same weight, the same equal chance of being picked
Any existing mods for more statics and units?

Any existing mods for more statics and units?
None that allow you to create missions to put on the workshop
(I hope)

So to make someone move you need event more that anything else, (with path and units ofc)   But how to make arty shoot waypoint? Cant find any event for it
And default waypoint do fug all
Ah i see. o was choosing unitgroup

why my mission dont start?
because something's wrong
and what is?

and how can i do that?
on units?
Yes

What exactly does the "StayInRadius" Behavior make ground units do?
for infantery it make them randomly run in a 64m radius
good for helo mission

And what about tanks? Similar concept?
i don t think it work for anything else than inf
How can I make a mission a multiplayer one?

How can I make a mission a multiplayer one?
been tryna learn how to use the editor
You cannot create standalone multiplayer missions, only multiplayer campaigns. Create a campaign and there is a check box to make it multiplayer.

Can I transfer an already existing mission to a campaign?
You can by editing the .vts file.
another thing I'm tryina upload to steam, but I get an error message saying that there's no player spawn But there is one and I can't add any more because there already is a player spawn bro what 🗿

? i have evrything done. just trying to rename it
campaign or mission?
If it's a mission I think you need to go in the editor itself, find the tab says scenario info and change the name

I really can't find anything to help sorry Can't you just switch it in the campaign menu?
On another note I'm having problems setting up spawn points in a MP campaign im tryna do I just get soft locked in the loading screen with the map What player spawn points should I add? I've already got a bunch of MP ones, but there's also the regular "player" spawn, which I thought was for SP only
another question (jesus this is complicated) I've got an error message "There are no player slots in the Scenario Info Window"
But nowhere in there can I chose the slots Where can I set them up?

That would be a bug if true. Are you on the public_testing branch?
Yup
Sure it's a bug? Cause when it was at 0 I couldn't spawn in and when it's at the maximum the player slots appear Isn't it what it does?

aaaah ok thanks

What is the range of the enemy MBT?
I'm playing a workshop mission in AH-94. The mission triggers an event once TADS locks to a particular (friendly) unit. I'm wondering how this is achieved. Haven't been in mission editor for a while but had a look just now and noticed a lot of new vehicle control conditionals that can be tested. But I can't see anything that behaves as above - fires when a unit is locked on by TADS. Anybody know how it is done?  Not mission editor I know, but does helicopter have a night vision setting?  I can't see a button on the dash for it!
Vehicle Controls conditions do not work in multiplayer. However, there is a condition to check if a player unit is locking another specific unit using a specific sensor.

Also, you can always activate NVG by clicking your forehead

how about if someone joins in mid game? That would increase the value by 1 Would that break anything?
That I wouldn't mind
thanks a lot man

is that plane or helicopter you want to check on take off?

Hey guys!  I've setup a VTOL competitive league! (No, not just "another one", or "just a tournament"). We are setting up a full season with rankings, weekly matches, and a season ending tournament in November.  With this massive undertaking, we as a community need some balanced PVP mission.  Itt doesn't need to be immediately done.  As of now, our main Mission is going to be the PVP strike mission variants(with additions to the map pool gradually coming).  Honestly if someone can just Copy/Paste that entire map and programming and JUST add a hard time limit of 1hr 15 mins, then the league will be set.    If it can't be copy/pasted or just edited simply, then an entire map with EXTREMELY similar layout would be much loved.    Let me know if anyone is interested in joining as a player, or joining up as a map/mission consultant.

Id like to see some of the asymmetric pvp go into that league. I cant remember who it was that made it though. @Strikeeaglechase If i remember you were there during the asymetric pvp match yea? when I was flying a helo and i think you and the map maker were flying low tech
@Browning made that map.
Thank you i couldnt remember. I'd love to see something like that for a tourny

I'm in now way an expert in this stuff.  :). I did look at the map and misson editor IN GAME, didnt find a way to do it there, scanned thru the local files on my PC for the map to add to the editor folders but couldnt find it, and the official map isn't posted by BahamutoD that I could see.  So I got stuck in the mud on this.  Perhaps BahamutoD can simply add the premade map to the workshop and we just DL it from there?  Idk how to proceed.  :)
Missions on the workshop are in a special compiled format that cannot be edited. Only the original creator has access to the files needed to edit a mission. EDIT: Without breaking EULA and the trust of mission creators everywhere.
Noice.  Idk why I read @Strikeeaglechase as "Strike Eagle Cheese", but he's part of the league and will surely put some effort towards this project once it gets underway, so we should be set.

the hard way of not breaking steams encryption?
It's not steam encryption

Could someone link some form of tutorial for PvP missions? Instead of just dropping 86 questions in chat that get answered in 2 seconds
For context: I wanna make a pvp mission where you need to do a couple of objectives to win
and also get kills at the end

how can i make it so that the bots only fire on incomming armament instead of atacking players? i'm trying to make a multiplayer mission for me and my friends so we can practise fighting the NFP carrier
Use the ignore target unit event action
(Tell the carrier to ignore the mp spawns)

okay, if i understand correctly i need to go to the event tab and make an event that if a player get's detected he/she get's ignored, right?
i'm pretty new to vtol's editor
You can do it right from the start

so, i've tried setting all my allied unit's to non target for the bot's but they will still shoot me if i come close. am i doing something wrong?
Other way around
Or maybe not

What's in the non-targets "7 selected"?
all of those that are checked are player controlled
Just going to check it myself

is there any way to add fire effects to buildings?
Nope
the only way ive found is to use one of those crashed kestrel props and shoved them into the houses lmao

But all the hesco walls and similar? Go wild
ahhhh okay wonderful then
what about the kestrels

should i just leave the behavior as is?
All the default behaviour stuff is overridden by any event actions the unit receives
very nice.

How did you do this*?
put a crashed kestrel prop on the floor or the same level as whatever it is you want the fire to come out of  hold middleclick and drag it into an object **without letting go of middleclick, press spacebar**  voila
holy shit.

Is there a way to snap platforms together so there is no height difference? . If I do it currently I get a slight increase in height for every platform.
If you start at the high end, you might be able to set the altitude so that the rest are the same
Might also try Bishop's middle click drag trick ^

OK appreciate the responses - never tried file editing, and wouldn't know what to tweak etc - but do you start by opening the mission file in a text editor? - if this is too big a subject to get into - no worries at all - please ignore the question 👍
I can absolutely show you
It's really easy, it's a raw text file that uses the KSP file save format

OK really appreciate it and would be interested to learn. Where do I start - going to bed soon but will try to view the mission file tomorrow on a break. Do I need to download a specific file reader for the KSP file save format?
Nope
just any text editor will work

If i spawn in some bombers on a path, is there a way to keep their speed the same the whole time?
seems like they keep speeding off even after i set in an event their initial speed to slow
I think it depends what action you give them. If they are just flying to a nav point they should follow their set nav speed.

@Sypwn Did you remove the 145s from the delta internal bays?
yeah
Ah lol

@Sypwn so delta is going to be literally just bombs and guns?
F-45As still have wing pylons
they also still have their aim-9s

So.... self defense and the entire principle of multirole out the window?
if the F45 was crippled like that in the main game, i would understand your frustration. but i think this makes dynlib more fun and team based
I disagree

if we had 4 fully capapble F45 noone would ever play the other aircraft, becausewhy should you? you can just do everything with it at once. no need for dedicated cap and a2g players.
I mean if he does end up making jaidenskymode that will probably end up being a 45 will a2g and a2a
I would still play the 26 because the 26 is fun! I play dynlib to have a good time, not do actual coop, because coop is not happening in a pub lobby, no matter how hard you try

how do I import a standalone mission into a mp campaign?
when I paste the mission file into the campaign and try to upload it just says no player spawn
well you have to add player spawns to a mp mission..

do I need to place a spawn everywhere I want players to spawn?
Yes?
it only lets me make 1 player spawn

Can we get a slash macro that explains about MP campaigns and how to convert to one?
Shadow is the one to talk to about that
But he’s mentioned he dosnt want to bloat it too much

Is it possible for team B in MP missons to have a fully working AWACs? I can't get mine to do picture/bogey dope callouts.
@Skumby good morning my man i tried to launch my mission again, and while it did work, it didnt display in vr. meaning i couldnt do shit with it. what am i to do?
Does it display on the monitor? Does anything appear in your headset? Do you see the helmet scene, or the map load scene, or the team scene or the slot selection scene?

Damnit, I am trying to get an enemy group (Alpha) to Spawn as a group randomly in one place or another. But the Spawn Index doesn't let me change it.  Doesn't seem to allow me to edit "idx" but only if this has been placed within a FIRE CONDITIONAL ACTION. Is there a better way to do this?
Alt spawns sound like what you want
You don't need to use a conditional action to get them to work

ok so just spawn then and let the weight figure it out, so long as they're in a group they'll be together?
So all the members of the group will use the same alt spawn index
ohh i seee....

Can you not put two prox triggers, one on each of spawn 1 and 2, that spawns a bunker on 1 or 2 if it sees members of alpha nearby?
That's a clever idea
does proxy only affect spawned units?

does proxy only affect spawned units?
Yup, non-spawned units don't exist. Or shouldn't exist. If unalive people trigger a trigger, that's a bug
You'll have a little more work testing to see if the bunker's dead, as now there'll be two bunkers that you'll have to check, but at least you'll have your units and bunker spawning together

Global variable tracking the state of...reinforcement?
phases
so to speak

but its a pain to find out how many are dead and use that number to spawn X amount? I thought you can't compare values.
I figured. fek
Or rather it'd be several, in a conditional action

How do you get to the team selection if it doesn't show on the HMD? Does it show the first few scenes on the HMD then stop?
it literally just opens on either scene, on my monitor. nothing on the HMD other than the virtual desktop thing
You using virtual desktop, or link/airlink?

You using virtual desktop, or link/airlink?
im not sure what it's called but its just the regular oculus link via cable
i didn't install any third party apps

Are you using oculus mode or the default SteamVR?
default steamvr
i use oculus link to make it a PCVR headset and then all of my games run with steamvr

And you're starting SteamVR before starting VTOL VR?
nope, launches automatically right before the game does
Try starting SteamVR before starting VTOL VR. Does the game appear in your headset before you enter the mission editor? Does it show "Mission Editor uses your monitor" when you're in the editor?

Try starting SteamVR before starting VTOL VR. Does the game appear in your headset before you enter the mission editor? Does it show "Mission Editor uses your monitor" when you're in the editor?
will do the game does appear in my headset before i launch the mission editor and it does give me the text yeah
I honestly don't know. I've not heard of anyone having issues like this. Most people have trouble right from the start, not from it breaking half way through

Is it a multiplayer mission?
yes
two seater heli type thing

if i have this set for the entire group, do they attack anything close by that is considered hostile or do they focus on the player?
They'll attack anything
You can set priority targets if you want them to focus on something

is there any way to start this event on objective start?
the enemies do not spawn until the 2nd objective starts
You might want to increase the Count too, otherwise it'll be the saddest carpet bombing ever

so if i begin the objective i can set the event to trigger and the enemies will begin the attack on the selected targets?
Should do, yeah
You'll want to make sure the Enabled check box is not checked in the CarpetbombEvent, so it doesn't activate itself until you trigger it

wait so if the event already is set to begin with objective two, what do i do with all the stats here?
Whatever you want
It's all entirely irrelevent

The Backstop are SARH or ARM?
pretty sure they're SARH
what would be their usage over BSM?

what would be their usage over BSM?
I'm not really familiar with Allied ground and stationary units :/
The backstop are Enemy tho AFAIK.

@Sypwn Any chance you could take a look at a campaign and figure out why its causing a black screen?
Its an invalid character in file path but I don't see any invalid characters anywhere
That sounds familiar

is it possible to make the multiplayer spawns on a carrier work if the carrier is moving? it seems like the fleets of ships are typically in motion, but I'm wondering about how you'd go about setting up spawns for a multiplayer carrier-op mission where you start on the carrier. strikes me that you'd get left behind and spawn in the air if you didn't spawn in like, instantly all together
You attach the spawns to the carrier and they will move with it.
I'm getting a screenshot...

So, had converted my map from SP to MP, and there was a glitch where the AH-94 could not requip the GAU, probably from restricted weapon selection. How do I fix this? I assume I need to edit the VTC or VTS file
The patch notes for the latest public testing update addressed that I think >     - Fixed: Could not rearm when a singleplayer mission with forced equips is converted to multiplayer
But I've also seen apparently rearming is janky right now either way?

But I've also seen apparently rearming is janky right now either way?
Oh? So I don't need to do anything? Hmmm
Do you know of a way to properly form the VTC and VTS files? I suspect it has to do with any of these lines.

Howdy peeps. If I set a carrier and some cruisers as a group, and then tell the carrier to follow a path, will the other ships follow? Also, I want to create an objective where the player has to deliver troops to a secret base in some mountains. If they are spotted, I have it set up so there is a trigger if the player is detected. What I want to know, is if there is a way to disable that trigger after the objective of dropping off troops has been completed successfully without be spotted. I know you can cancel an objective, but can you cancel triggers on objective completion?

That you! I assume I need a trigger to get the group to move since I can't select groups to issue orders.

Yes, or you can use the start actions from one of your objectives.

Okay. What would be the best method to get rid of the detection trigger? I am very confused looking at sequences. 😦
I'm away from my computer right now, but you want to create a **completed action** in the objective, to **stop** the conditional event you created.
Thank you!

Is there a way of disabling specific weapons on the enemy ships by adding lines to the   .vts file? Want enemy carrier to have AA guns but no active Sam's.
I don't believe thats possible
You can specifically destroy those weapons with trigger actions, but they will appear on fire. Maybe you can come up with an explanation such as a preemptive attack.

Thanks for the responses guys. Destroying them with a trigger would help. Also to save testing do you know if a carrier / gunship would attack a ground target with on guns  - specifically a storage tent? Or will they only fire on aircraft.
No idea, never tested.
OK no worries - all to do with a bit of a different mission approach I'm trying. 👍

CIWS might be able to target ground units????? Im not sure,  I kind of doubt that
Geez it only takes like 2 mins to test. Of the allied ships, only the cruiser's main gun will fire at a ~~ground target~~ tank.
Id have to touch the mission editor tho

Were they within 5km of the ground targets?
If you're scared of the mission editor, then why are you in #mission_editor
Because I can answer some of the mission editor questions kek

Was the testing target within 2km? Im *guessing* it requires a radar lock to fire, but it can *see* tanks
actually no it can't see tanks, but it can see infantry/tents
The target is a tank barely visible near the top center of the screenshot.

Then what, tents? Landed aircraft?
Id try infantry, or tent's
or both

I need some help. I made a mission and I can't upload it. Anyone know what's going on?
upload your log
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

is that a multiplayer mission/campaign?
nope

no
or just do window r then cmd

Is Unity's cdp really required to upload files to steam workshop?
No idea but its consistant with other workshop errors iv seen
Lemme see if I can find a dependency on it

can I do something to fix it?
(cant paste a link because it's got quotes in the search)
Some people say to just try again later. Some people mention problems with using family sharing. Some people say the files they are trying to upload are too big.

Does the mission have really large briefing pictures or lots of background music or something?
it got some 8 custom voicelines and a few fotos
As for the DNS error, if you are the one responsible for your internet connection and you don't have any custom networking hardware (3rd party gaming router, Pihole, etc) then you can call your ISP for support

How do I put 'notes' into the. Vts file please? Putting a lot of static objects in and wanted to put a note/name in next to an object ID so I know which are for what area  on the map. Do I have to put it inside a certain type of bracket?
Not sure if it's possible without the comments getting wiped the next time you save it from in the editor.
No worries - thanks anyway. Will have to find a pen a paper 😂

Is it possible (in theory) to make a mission that randomly generates objectives and spawns enemies (as in a mission generator)?
through mods yeah, but in base game the closest thing you can do is make a bunch of objectives yourself and have them randomly activate
missions like Killbox and Dynamic Lib do this

What's the bare, and I mean *bare* minimum cash needed for a fighter jet?

quick question, are triggered events permanent on do the only fire once? I would like to change a global value based on kills/deaths and was wondering if the event would stop after one successful trigger
They are limited to a single firing. We mission creators have been asking Baha for loopable triggers for a while.

so is there a way to use the score system to trigger events? Team A gets 100 points and they win kind of thing?

Best workaround is to create an event sequence with a node for each death, up to whatever limit your sanity allows. It's easier to copy-paste nodes with Notepad++, but that's a whole other can of worms.
ok cool. Thanks for your help Sypwn

really? can't seem to find it
Is the mission part of a MP campaign?
yes its a MP score keeper. I'm attempting a hide and seek map 2x F45 vs 10x FA26B I have a timer, but I wanted to use a scoring system to punish seeker deaths 10 for a kill -5 for a death. I can add it to the score system, but I couldn't find a trigger to pop at a certain score

There's a conditional node type "MP Stats" or something like that. If what you need is not in there, then I can't help.

Solo for now
ill check it out later tonight

I'm getting into making missions, any tips?
make sure travel times make sense
don't make the helicopter fly farther than 20nm

One time I had a 53 nm flight. We died. A lot.  But also, do you have to manually add players? Cause right now I have a player spawn on an aircraft carrier, do I have to add more or can they all spawn on the carrier? I only have 1 player spawn identified right now.
iirc you have to put a spawn for every slot you want
Ok, thanks!

Wait are stand alone missions mp?
I cannot add another player spawn
yeah thats one of the biggest things I wanted to stay away from, i'm a heli gunner and sometimes I have to fly solo, I know the pain of flying for 25nm and getting shot down by a slam truck

@AtrociousAmbition/Mr. Charisma would editor tips be too subjective for the wiki?
I wouldn't stop you from making a blog post for it, at least.
I'd need a blog for that

Enemy Rocket Artillery, and MPA-155. What are their maximum ranges in KM?
And before anyone says "2-8KM" to the Rocket Artillery, that's if they visually acquire, but if they acquired a target indirectly how far could they launch from. Nevermind accuracy since that can apparently be cheated.
About 25km I think

What happens if not everybody wants to do the same thing?
Each sector has a number of events that result in the map being threatened by enemies every time the player does something
The choice comes down to a single AV-42 who selects an option

Oh, so one holds power?
Hah! I like it.
The map is built for 6 AH-94's and 1 AV42

Seems interesting! I really wanna see how this unfolds as a campaign! How many missions are there?
Sectors are between 7k to 20k apart, so travel distances will be optimized to allow plenty of action inbetween
It's one mission, not a campaign

Cool! So what's the main priority so far?
Just filling out sectors will enemies, connecting it all. and of course balance testing this
Nice, what about the mission, what's it about?

@Sypwn Using the Action Fire on Waypoint Radius. Will it do this continuously? I set Allow Reload on all my rocket artillery's
Doesn't it have a parameter for number of volleys/salvos or something?
well I want it to keep shooting until they're destroyed.

Then make it a very large number

Is their default behaviour set to follow a path or parked until triggered?
Default is navigate path
Only difference between them is hull number

And they are near the path to be able to travel it? Do you have a screenshot of the properties and path?
Actually thats the issue
thank you

Was trying to do a target practice type training map with a bunch of different target groups/regions with different types of ground targets/threats that would respawn after you killed them all in a given area.  example-  'Alpha' group of enemy tanks is a tank column.. say like 10 vehicles that spawn immediately, follow a path that loops.  an Event is set that when numalive of 'Alpha' = 0, then it would force spawn unit group 'Alpha'  i tried that, but i guess the 'spawn' function only spawns units that have not ever been alive, rather than spawning units that were once alive and now dead... so...  anybody got any other ideas that don't require me to just manually add a TON of units in individual, finite waves to spawn one after another?
how do I have multiple types of aircraft and choose where they spawn. I only have access to 1 player spawn so do I just put aircraft spawns?
I know I can add alt spawns but I cant change their squad per alt spawn

@illumi i think i had the same confusion- you're probably trying to do a single mission, right?  like, instead of creating a 'campaign'?  the 'mission' or whatever that's sort of a stand-alone one-shot deal doesn't work quite the same... no reason to really use it as far as i can tell

build your thing as a 'campaign' so that you can make it multiplayer if you want. then you can place as many 'Player Spawn' items as you want instead of just one... and you can set which vehicle each one is.
when you make a 'Campaign' instead of a little one-shot mission, you can make missions inside the campaign, and they can support numerous player spawns for each team. each spawn can then be set to a specific vehicle and squad.

what are you guys' favorite text-to-speech tools for making audio clips for missions?
There a way to start the mission without going into vr just to see if certain things work?
@Pjork so, you can do testing from in the editor, but you WILL have to put your headset on for like just a second.

Hey, quick question: I am making my first mission but when I attempt to upload for multiplayer testing it gives me a warning that reads ‘the game doesn’t have any fail safes for if it loads an object it doesn’t know and it softlockes peoples games. This will Probably be fixed in an update’. What does this mean? Any help would be great.
seems like its just a heads up that the game is a bit buggy in its current state
as far as i know this is normal

Hey, if I want to have a switch for setting the "engage enemies" status of units, triggered by for example the player locking a bunker with the tgp to activate it, and locking another to deactivate it, how exactly will this affect already launched missiles if the unit being toggled is for example a Missile cruiser?
It won't affect missiles at all, and there is no way to control them with triggers.
Oh wait, missiles require radar lock

how do i get smoke?
a way to make a mission guaranteed last forever is to have one required destroy objective with an invincible unit?
i want any of 12 players to be able to trigger an event by locking on to a specific unit. because i want 10+ of those trigger units, i would like to know if there is a way to do it without having it look like this

Is there any intention of including AWACS in the Dynamic Liberation missions?
I may try and make it a gamemode, but I have no idea how to make missions
I can make a quick mock-up

im unable to add a target for them to board, will they go to the closest allied aircraft without one selected?
A) The only AWACS available in the game is an E-3 Sentry, which cannot be launched from a carrier. If an E-2 Hawkeye or equivalent carrier capable AWACS was made available, I would consider it. B) Personally I find the AWACS callouts quite annoying, especially when I'm in an F-45 with full situational awareness, and AFAIK there is no way to mute them without muting all team comms.  Voice acting is coming soon™️ which may include some degree of reinforcement callouts. Until then, it should be the role of Alpha to call out new threats.
you can independently control comms for AI and other team members

is this a standalone mission?
You probably created a singleplayer mission. To create multiple player spawns, the mission has to be inside a multiplayer campaign. To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign 2. Import your mission into the campaign 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer.
yes

any chance someone could help me with this?
i do not know
I've never used troop pickup, and I'm not near pc right now.

and does anybody know if completion rewards go to everyone or the person who completed the objective?
also do budgets actually do anything? the cost went over-budget, but it didnt restrict it at all
Maybe not in multiplayer. I don't know of anyone else that uses them.

how do you get a carrier group to stay together and follow a path?
No. You have to fake it by making multiple copies of the unit.

Put them all in the same group, then use a UnitGroup trigger action to command them to move.

Does this happen to be allied cruisers against enemy GAV-25?
and asf 30's
- AI are really good at beaming/notching and using CM - Allied cruiser missiles appear to have a pretty small splash zone - GAV-25s can take A LOT of damage Added up, it can take 8+ cruiser missiles to take down a single GAV-25

@Sypwn got a link to some documentation of how to edit the files in notepad for that purpose? I'm plenty comfortable messing around with text for stuff like that as long as I know the notation or whatever
Use Notepad++. Beyond, that, it's all in english, and the syntax is relatively self-explanatory. I feel like "if you need a guide, you shouldn't be doing it". Just make a backup of your mission, then start messing around. You can ping me with specific questions. Chase also wrote some JS code to convert the VTS to JSON, or something like that.
As for how to convert a mission between SP and MP: Make a SP campaign and create a blank mission with only a player spawn Make a MP campaign and create a blank mission with only a player spawn Compare the two VTS files to see what's different. That shows you what you need to change to convert between the two.

how does spawning on the carrier work? do I have to put down mp spawns and parent them to the carrier or something?
nvm i gotit
@Sypwn or anybody else really... what's the difference between these values? i assume the 'initial delay' is only relevant if you have the 'Begin Immediately' box checked... right?  so if I want a timed event to start 25 seconds after the completion of an objective, I can put that as an action in the complete objective section... and the way I have this set would do that?

`Initial delay` effectively adds that delay to ALL nodes in that timed group
so regardless of when the whole group is triggered to start, it's just a buffer. so doesn't matter if it starts immediately or not

Where do I put the feature requests?
Because I wanted to modify the loading screen graphic and it...didn't turn out the way I had hoped ;p
Also, apparently in testing, when you set Invincible when launched from Editor, the Invincibility flag only applies to the first vehicle. Not subsequent respawns.

I was told height.png was the one to edit. I guess that's wrong?
I thought it was one of the two, not sure
As I understand, preview is only shown in the editor thumbnail and thats all?

As I understand, preview is only shown in the editor thumbnail and thats all?
I see that you've had this discussion with RED already
Either way it shouldn't have changed the map mesh itself even if you modified heat.png unless you regenerated the heightmaps

Yep terrain was fine
Interesting

any tricks to get an unit to takeoff?
iv set a taxi path to the runway, and a proximity trigger to comand overlord to take off, it plays the radio audio when the trigger is set but it doesnt takeoff
Don't taxi them to the runway. Let them do that themselves.

Is the airbase properly configured and owned by that team?
in the Bases tab
yes

Could someone help with this?
I can't figure out why they wont follow the path
I've also tried rail path

Damn is so hard to get a mission to work properly.. Am i too dumb? Lol
Lots of trial and error
Keep forgeting to link the correct triggers to the right things and timing argh...

Hey, I'm trying to have some infantry advance on a city, but when I drew a path they all ended up lining up in a big conga line. If I want them to all just walk forward do I need to draw a path for them all individually?
When using a path, they will walk to the path then follow it exactly.  If you want them to walk toward the city independently, you should instead create a waypoint and tell them to walk to it. If you want them to instead move along the path but in a different formation, make them all members of a group, then (using an action) tell the entire group to follow the path.
which behavior makes them all walk towards a waypoint?

which behavior makes them all walk towards a waypoint?
Telling each one individually to walk to the waypoint
either as an action ~~or by default behavor~~ EDIT: didn't realize infantry don't have a Move To Waypoint behavior...

Or is it through events?
Actions must be created either by an event, or though an objective
Got it, thank you!

Also, are allied forces way stronger than enemy forces? When I did a test run the allies killed all the enemies pretty quickly
I'm not sure, sorry. I haven't really worked with allied units much.
Ok, thanks for the help!

why do my KC-49 tanker and UARV refueling drones not show up when I go ingame? do they need an E-4 AWACS?
define "not show up"
they're not in the comms menu, so I cant communicate to them to request aerial refueling

are they not supposed to-?
I've never done aerial refueling tbh but I assumed thats how its done
I've never used em :/

do you know what speed the auto nav is set to? when I set it to 250 it flies at like mach 0.8-0.9 so it's definitely not knots
Most units within the editor are metric, the speed is in m/s
that would explain why its traveling at nearly the speed of sound instead of 260 knots...

when making aerial units, is there an easy way to make them fly in formation? or do I need to make a separate path for each unit?
Put them all in a group, then, using an event action, tell the entire UnitGroup to move somewhere
If you tell each plane to go somewhere individually, they will do so independently. But if you tell the group to move using a UnitGroup action, they will do so in formation.

even if its a path?
yes

Does Objective Clear action not work in multiplayer?
you mean cancel?
yes

🤔 You sure about that?
It usually writes the reason the objective can't be cancel to player.log if you try
Oh ok... Hmmmmm

What does the log say?
Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state None! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state None! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state None! Cannot cancel an objective that is in state Completed!
but with objectives like Pick up and Drop off which I need to complete, this won't help me

Are you canceling the objective at the same moment it's being completed?
nope, after a "PHASE" is completed
Can I cancel it upon completion?

Can I cancel it upon completion?
Then that could be a bug. I can dig into it tomorrow.
Don't try.

now how do i upload it then?
with the upload button
didn't work

Did you change any of the mission files manually?
You could also try changing it directly in the workshop
Or delete the workshop entry if you don't care about the stats

did you rename the ~~mission~~ campaign files directly or edit them with notepad?
I'm trying to change the campaign name
not the individual mission

in the vts file for a mission, can you increase the number of targets (to destroy) past 50? idk if it actually works
Yes
Also limit?

like i have more targets than i can set as minimum required so if i edit the vts file itll increase minimum needed?
You could just use a conditional objective UnitList [Units] Number Alive Is 0 The only downside is the OBJ screen loses the unit counter, but you may consider that an acceptable loss.

I want to endanger it with enemies that players have to take out before too much damage is done, but I don't want to kill this cruise too easily, or by chance.  Obviously putting a bunch of infantry isn't really going to kill it, so I need something dangerous, but not deadly. Thoughts?

@Sypwn are you able to despawn/deactivate ground radars/units after an obj is completed?
Deactivate, yes. "Engage enemies" can be toggled for most units. Definitely the MAD-4 at least.  Despawn, no
What I'm saying is that it's sorta possible using some trickery, as long as it doesn't involve destroying units.

id figure a mountain range ordeal?
But with all AH-94s, as you suggested. Makes more sense
Ask the PvP players what they think

@Temperz87 @Kazper @Strikeeaglechase @Jaidensky   (im missing some but these are the ones i know)  For an Ah-94 domination game mode would you guys prefer a mountain range, plains, valley, or something else?

play and adjust unit count and posistion accordingly
yep

and SAMs et al. just kind of go as much as feels right, right?
some sams have their counterparts on both teams, i would recommend going to PT as it will be more balanced since currently you have more SAM options
some things to note:

how do I make tunnels??
you can't
the akutan map is special

can you manually edit anythings position?
you put a waypoint where you want the object to be, then you go into the .vts and copy the waypoint's coords and paste it as the object's coords
A) Don't use Windows Notepad to edit the .vts, or else it will screw up the line endings. Use Notepad++ or another more advanced text editor. B) After making .vts changes outside the game, you must completely quit out of VTOL to reload your changes into the game.

do I also need to change lastValidPlacement, or only globalPosition?
The helicarrier isn't real... or possible
dunno, try both

I am introducing myself to the editors. I started working on a campaign. I would like for the second mission to get many assets back as they were set up in the first mission. Positions of radars, SAM, docks, bunkers, etc I don‘t see a button to duplicate a mission. How can I do that?

hey all, If this is off topic let me know where to put it. I extracted and ported the Operation: Desert Cobra campaign to the F-45 and have been playing through it to test it.

Well ask Baha he made the campaign

yo Sypwn, you said last night about disabling aircraft carrier catapults by having bots get on the catapult, then get destroyed?  How would I do that? Taxi event, then takeoff? Can I make them go to specific catapults since I only want to disable some?
I wouldn't seriously use that method in a mission
But no, you can't pick catapults. You have to rely on the AI using the same catapults in each run

Why only disable a couple catapults?
side catapults will launch aircraft into a mountainside
Oh

I don't remember where exactly or if it was a mod but can you place down arrestor cables in the editor?
that would be CSA
it's a mod

thats awesome!!! is it mp also ?
I guess I could make MP, I haven't been messing with VTOL VR for long but I assume it's just another value in the mission file
You can ask baha, I asked about the built in PVP strike mission and he said it was fine, but a campaign might be different I dunno, just gotta ask him

Is it possible to make dynamic campaigns? (like Enemy Engaged)
Depends how you define "dynamic". The events of one mission cannot affect another, if that's what you're referring to.
In Enemy Engaged, it's basically a single session where missions are created depending how the war is going between two factions, dynamically creating missions for CAS/Recon etc etc as needed.

Can I add it later?
or do I need to reupload as a new map?
also how upload the map will update the old one?

Yes, by updating it. On the Steam page, you can also change what pictures, videos, description it shows, and is much more convenient to use than the in-game tools (mostly because it's a markdown editor)

It will just replace the old one on Steam, using Steam's changelog system you may also add a note to it

Yes, VTOL VR does automatically check for updates (every time you boot up the game I think?)
Now it look like this
Here is a test image

Hard to say without more info. Does that land objective show up on the mission complete panel?
Does anyone know how to get land units moving?
Tried setting up a path but they just sit awkwardly in one place.

Did you also set Default Behavior to follow path?

Did you also set Default Behavior to follow path?
yes sir
is just Path or the Rail Path thing

is the path far from their starting location?
just use Path
Is 100 meters too much?

Is 100 meters too much?
No, that should be fine
Not sure what the problem is, but you can also try using a trigger action to command them to move and see if that works better.

did you tick start immediately?
I fixed it
Anybody know what might cause the steam workshop section of hosting missions to load indefinitely whenever you're subscribed to a mission? The mission in question is this https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2834819389&searchtext=, I can launch it from the mission editor just fine and it only has 100 units total so I'm not sure on what might be causing it to load indefinitely.

The answer will be in the player.log
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Does this campaign only have one mission?
Yea
I have the link to the map in the description of Operation Operation First sight if that's the problem

Did you make any changes by editing the .vts file?
no just by using the mission editor
I just re-subbed to your campaign and it's still broken, so it's not the link.

Are you subscribed to Dender's campaign?
nope
Only way I know of is to use a C# debugger. Can you send me your list of subscribed MP campaigns?

@BahamutoD there is a multiplayer campaign ~~with a bugged mission description~~  that somehow contains a singleplayer mission that prevents the MP campaign list from loading. ```KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[TKey,TValue].get_Item (TKey key) [0x0001e] in <a1e9f114a6e64f4eacb529fc802ec93d>:0    at ConfigNode.GetValue (System.String name) [0x00000] in <a3694e4a02d042939f026ea37ba6344e>:0    at ConfigNode.GetValue[T] (System.String name) [0x00000] in <a3694e4a02d042939f026ea37ba6344e>:0    at VTOLVR.Multiplayer.MPMissionBrowser+BrowserMissionInfo..ctor (VTOLVR.Multiplayer.MPMissionBrowser+BrowserCampaignInfo c, System.String workshopDir, ConfigNode config) [0x000b4] in <a3694e4a02d042939f026ea37ba6344e>:0    at VTOLVR.Multiplayer.MPMissionBrowser+BrowserCampaignInfo+<LoadWsRoutine>d__11.MoveNext () [0x0021a] in <a3694e4a02d042939f026ea37ba6344e>:0    at UnityEngine.SetupCoroutine.InvokeMoveNext (System.Collections.IEnumerator enumerator, System.IntPtr returnValueAddress) [0x00026] in <72b60a3dd8cd4f12a155b761a1af9144>:0 ```
heres mine

I'm only seeing networking errors in that log. Something is blocking web access. Do you have any firewalls or a Pihole or something?
no
i thought there might be a dead link somewhere

Did you create it as a singleplayer mission then convert it to multiplayer? If so, what method did you use?
I didn’t convert it, I’m not at my pc atm but I’ll try that as soon as I get home which is in about 15-30 minutes
these are the settings I've had for a while so I'm not sure why its missing

Question on the Default Behavior for units: I've set units for a triggered airborne spawn with the orders to attack a specific priority target, so it likely wouldn't matter which behavior I set, correct? Otherwise I *could* set it to Path mode but if the target is in motion, there's no guarantee that it would be at any specified point at that moment
Priority target means they will attack that target when they detect it. Until then, they will follow default behavior and attack other units.  Dedicated target means they will ignore their default behavior and go straight for the target you specified.  In both cases, be sure the add priority/dedicated targets actions happen *after* the spawn unit action.
Is there any way to limit radar range on AI aircraft?

spawn them further I guess?
You cannot do it from the editor otherwise, no

Dammit okay

Could this be done with a waypoint?
yes
yes

Is it possible to participate in a multiplayer session where we just edit missions?
no
best you can do is screen share

Is there any plan to allow the editing of workshop scenarios & campaigns?
They are specifically made so you cannot steal them
What if you don't steal, you simply improve the mission and re-upload? Just accredit the original author?

What if you don't steal, you simply improve the mission and re-upload? Just accredit the original author?
Cant trust people for that, this is the Internet we're talking about
Ask the author if they are willing to make a variant with those improvements, or if they will send you the mission files so you can.

ey does anyone know how to stop the AI twerking when following a path? I've tried speed and weight changes on the aircraft, which helps a bit, and also changing the path type to linear, bezier, smooth and also all the altitudes on the waypoints are equal, so it's not like they're step climbing or something... The same aircraft fly buttery smooth when just heading to a waypoint or RTB etc, so I'm pretty sure it's the path, or they way AI responds to paths...
twerking?
F-45 too:

anyone knows how to fix infinite loading screen?
infinite ram?
wow

What does repacking the map do?
If create a map, then create a mission with it, then go back and edit the map, your map changes won't show up in the mission until you "repack" it.
isnt that what saving is for?

isnt that what saving is for?
?
like if I save the mission doesnt it do the exact same?

like if I save the mission doesnt it do the exact same?
you can't edit the map from within the mission editor
you have to edit the map in the map editor

if i repack the map on an existing mission (minor changes) does it delete the units?
No
I just tried

Will this make the units drive to the waypoint?
Or do I need to change the behaviour to path for that?
it should

Or do I need to change the behaviour to path for that?
it should
as a wise man once said (who is tragically not in the server anymore) create an event that tells the entire unit group to move to a waypoint

Will they automatically just follow the road?
No. For that you have to make a path that perfectly follows the road
God damit

And let me guess the path cant just automatically stick to the road I have to actually like do that myself?
its just a bunch of points
dont worry about it

@Sypwn are you still up to make the helo competitive mission if i provide you a map?
sure
awesome

We're talking about a mode where two teams are trying to simultaneously hold 2 or 3 points, and can contest any of them at any time, right?
```        ----> Point 1 <----       /                   \ Team A                     Team B  Base                       Base       \                    /        ----> Point 2 <----```
The alternative is where the capture points are in a line and the teams are only contesting a single point at a time. ```Team A <-----> Point 1 <-----> Point 2 <-----> Team B```

Ok, do you want two or three points?
the alternative that would also be more performant is the same layout of the first however it would be 3 points each side
so

iirc you said you can have vics turn on or off equipment based on other things yea?
Each team base is defended by invincible SAMS.
Oh yeah, we can have invincible MAD-4 that turn on and off

well, sorta. Does team A have MAD-4?
the problem with that is they units for each team are not identical
The domination mode you are depicting avoids one of the main roles of the helo which is ground attack

🤔 how do you do your pop up spawns in dyn lib?
they only spawn once
how many do you have set up O.o

its almost like there are x number of straight segments in a path loop, but when the path gets really big, those straight segments, (or intervals?) get really far apart and the wobble gets noticeable. On short paths you can see the elevators wobbling really quickly but since its so fast it doesn't really do anything to the aircrafts flight path.
Note that none of this happens when flying to waypoints
does anybody know if there is any way to force enemy sam sites  to remain with the radar off until an event is triggered, other than making them spawn at that point?

Engage Enemies should control their radar state. I know it does for the MAD-4 at least.
thanks!!

how do i make a mision mutiplayer?
check the MP box and make sure you have MP spawns
It has to be in a multiplayer campaign.

i want to add wingmen and i want then to take off only when i tell then how do i do that?
set them to parked
and use an editor condition to tell your squad to take off

trigger event? I dont remember the name
ohhhhhhhhhh
where is the option to edit the score required to end the game for a multiplayer mission?

where is the option to edit the score required to end the game for a multiplayer mission?
Should be in the Scenario Info dialog
Am I blind or is it just not a option to change

So you would edit the objective instead?
Oh, there isn't a fixed limit? You just use a conditional objective?
I thought that was how missions with point-based objectives worked?

Oh, there isn't a fixed limit? You just use a conditional objective?
I thought that was how missions with point-based objectives worked?
dunno, never made one

I thought that was how missions with point-based objectives worked?
dunno, never made one
I've never actually made a pvp mission before but I had assumed for stuff like the inbuilt helicopter pvp

I have an objective with a single success condition:  Num (Player Group) Airborne > 0  And no matter what I do I can't seem to get that to return true.  I've taken off, flown to 20k ft, left the area, nothing seems to register that I am airborne.   What am I doing wrong?
I just tested this and you're right, it's bugged. I'll report it to Baha. Until it's fixed, you'll have to check `Is Not Landed` for each player and feed them all into an `OR` block.
is it a player group bug or a "airborn" bug? Could I just do (Player Group) > Is Not > All Landed?

is it a player group bug or a "airborn" bug? Could I just do (Player Group) > Is Not > All Landed?
Oh, forgot that was an option. I'm testing that now.
Nope, that doesn't seem to work either. I suspect UnitGroups are buggy when players are involved.

Hey all, new to VTOL mission editing here. Is there a way to "loop" or "reset" a trigger/objective sequence during a mission, or once they've triggered do they stay triggered for the duration?
Nope, no trigger looping.
Ok cheers. Back to the drawing board for me 😂

Is there a way to switch this radius value between spherical/cylindrical?
I think Unit and UnitGroup use different, one is spherical and the other is cylindrical, but I can't remember which is which.
But I do agree it should be a checkbox

Is UnitList cylindrical? Might be a possible workaround
Oh yeah. I meant to say UnitList. But again I don't remember which is cylindrical and which is spherical.
You'll have to test

Where do you find the maps of the default mp missions?
The one I used came included in the maps folder.
Like, it was already in the map editor

thats why im trying to get it, andy has done the same, do any of you know where to find these?
@Strikeeaglechase
Ill grab it in a bit

does "unit list" only need one unit to execute the logic?
yeah, but in that case, why not just use regular "unit" ?
well i did play the mission and killed one of the SAMs and it completed the mission.

yeah, but in that case, why not just use regular "unit" ?

you have Is Not All Alive

What're you trying to achieve?
Kill all 109 guys and thing happens?
yes

Kill all 109 guys and thing happens?
yes
then set Num Alive, then set the value to 0

Just curious, I haven't touched the mission editor at all yet, but how many teams can you have in a mission? Is it a maximum of two, or can you do 3 teams all fighting each other?
max 2
its fairly integral to how the game is setup to support only 2

Do infantry just hop into the av-42c if their in a certain radius or do I have to trigger something?
oh also can you add more stuff to a campaign after its already released on steam?
From the wiki. "Passenger transport is facilitated through objectives and triggers in the Mission Editor"

Not sure how one would go about doing it, but it apparently isn't automatic.

anyone know if the MPA-155 can shoot while moving or do they need to be parked?
If given the command to fire, they will automatically stop.
gotit

how do i convert it to mp?

I cant figure out how to import it ive been saving it but when i open up the import it doesnt show it

How do I disable Team B in a multiplayer scenario I'm making?
just don't make any player spawn points on team b

How do I disable Team B in a multiplayer scenario I'm making?
just don't make any player spawn points on team b
I want it to be a Co-op mission, and set Team B's player count to 0 but there's still an option to join whenever I launch the mission in the editor

Should I just make them ASF-30 or ASF-33's or something?
Try designated, not priority
Priority will only work if the unit actually detects the priority targets, otherwise it will follow its normal behavior

Maybe they are not equipped with them by standard. Have you looked if you van equip them?
They have the guns equipped already and they do use them. They just ignore my priority targets
After careful consideration

@Sypwn so to confirm, let's say I have a game with 5 matches, I can call the game loop from itself and it will work?
and after 5 rounds, I exit it?
"a game with 5 matches" what are you talking about?

and after 5 rounds, I exit it?
"a game with 5 matches" what are you talking about?
Inside a singular mission, there are multiple matches of players PvPing

"a game with 5 matches" what are you talking about?
Inside a singular mission, there are multiple matches of players PvPing
After everything, I wish to clean it up and restart it

can I make it call itself?
**IF** each sequence node has the exact same entry/exit conditions, and only have a single action of calling an identical Conditional Action, then there is a shortcut to duplicate that sequence node any number of times.
via the VTS file

so what was capable of calling itself?
Because entry conditions, exit conditions, and conditional actions are all referenced by ID. So if you duplicate the node, they will all continue to point to the same IDs
By manually editing the vts, you can make a conditional action call itself.

would that work in this case?
It's not very useful because it still has to resolve within a single frame
got it

Is there a way to duplicate a mission if you want to create a similar but slightly different mission?
save-as
Save As

Did a little preliminary checks to see if you can copy/paste events but just to make sure does anyone know for sure if you can or cannot and any possible workarounds if you can't?
@Sypwn
I'm not sure if I understand the question. There are no ways to duplicate events or actions in the editor, but it can be done manually with a text editor if you're careful. There is no way to make a condition loop forever.

Hey all. So I have a fueling tanker follow a path, then at the end of the path, hit a proximity trigger to tell it to land. It flies to the air field, but then just circles like its in a holding pattern. There are no other units in the game other than the player spawn. The whole action is 5 sec timer - take off. When Not landed - set path. Proximity trigger at path end. Unit Land & Set path to none. I have watched it all the way in Dev mode an all seems to work until it arrives at the airfield. Any ideas?
After testing the mission, check your player.log. Specifically, search it for the name/ID of that tanker. Lots of AI behavior is logged there and it may say why it wont land.
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Sup yall. Easy question: Do you need to manually cause enemy planes to take off? Like setting taxi path, holding patterns, take off timers, etc? Or does the game realize there are enemies in a base and does it automatically?
The airbase ATC coordinates takeoff for both players and AI. Unlike most players, AI will actually follow it. This is assuming you set their default behavior to "TakeOff" or command them to take off using an action.
Oh wow that's cool, awesome

What can cause a mission to try to load but never start ?
A few things, many of them have been fixed in the next build in public_testing.
If this is a multiplayer mission, double check that you have at least one MP spawn point, that you have NO "Player" (singleplayer) spawn points, and that your player counts are correct in the mission options.

does anyone know if changing whether the drone carriers engages enemies also affects the drones after they have launched?
whenever i start my mission the aircraft carrier instantly explodes, anyone know how to fix this?
nvm i forgot abt an obj that I put on the enemy team

what's the best way to delay an action?

what's the best way to delay an action?
For my mission after an objective completes I want a unit to wait x amount of time before moving
Either a timed event or an event sequence. If it's just a one-off like that, create a timed event and make it start when the objective completes.

Is there any way to force an allied unit onto the enemy team? Trying to add an enemy tanker to a mission.
currently no
but both teams are able to refuel off the allied tanker

Will enemy AIs automatically approach an allied tanker without shooting it down?
oh i don't think enemy AI can refuel off the tanker
but Team B in mp can

Does anyone happen to know if you can set the default location of the cursor when you load a mission? It's annoying to keep having to pan across my map whenever I do work
Wish it would just remember my last location
zoom out and double click

I don't suppose there's a way to disable the IFF brackets from appearing?  And before anyone says "Set Forced Undetected". That does not affect this.
Unfortunately not by the mission maker.
Not a great screenshot, but what I am referring are the Blue () and Red <>

Wouldn't it also not work due to TGP IFF?
That's not gonna work, lol
I am ok with it working on the TGP for gameplay

Why does it have to be the AV-42 that spots them?
Yeah 42c dosn't have radar at all, only the 94 can radar detect infantry
choppers do, but I suspect they'll be flying circles above the parked av-42 and radar clicking numberous targets that are packed together isnt going to play well on a MDF

Looks like you repacked your map to the wrong map?
can't tell much from that screenshot
what?

What the playercount/aircraft type? Seems like the perfect job for 2 26's running 4 CAGMs each
fair
Oh... yeah I dunno about that tbh lol. You'll have to heavily limit the 45, otherwise a single 45 is going to take out every oil rig lol

I want to simulate a explosion. Is there a way to "CHECK X UNITS IN AREA" and Destroy them?  I know I can do a condition that checks (if ANY from UNIT LIST is in Radius of Waypoint, but, that wouldn't let me filter those that are in range to destroy them)
the most effective way would be to either use an If-else block and check all possible conditions
or check them individually one after the other then blow em up

do the doors on hangers open automatically if there is an aircraft inside?
Yes
ok

Hey guys! Is there a way to simulate runway destruction? I have several gps coordinates placed on a runway. The plan is the player should release gps bombs, and when they hit all the gps points, the objective will complete.
However, i have no idea how to register bombs' hits on the coordinates.
It's there a way?

Is it possible to place destructible buildings like tents *under* the runway? If possible that would be a cleaner method of detecting the impacts
No
file editing?

Anybody know how the backstop launcher compare to the B enemy team options?  e.g. is the missile roughly as good as the enemy team SARH SAMs?
backstop is a BSM-66 equivalent
Rad, thx

Still pretty short range though, no?  Not hucking telephone poles like the MAD-4 after all.
I havn't tested
It's nice to at least have one set of "matched" SAMs for balancing, anyway.

Hey I've made a few missions now that people couldn't join half way through (it would say 'mission failed ' or something when they load into the server). Anyone know why? I can post links if necessary to my missions

Also, any tips/tutorials for the mission editor? I tried looking at the wiki and the pinned posts. I need help with setting a path for my enemy units to follow. I've created a custom path and selected the path in the unit's menu
I'm confused with the options here
"Tango Group Path" is basically a loop around some roads in the city that I want the tanks to follow

> Also, any tips/tutorials for the mission editor?  https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_tips
Change `Behavior` to `Path`, not `Follow`
But otherwise I think you got it

Let's say there are a group of 4 tanks. Should make all of them Behavior: Path? or just the first one and the other 3 can follow each other?
If you want them to follow the path in formation, you need to use an event action to tell the Tango group to follow the path.
There is also an event action to set which formation they use. You'll probably want `Line` formation.

Quick question: How do I enable the gunner seat spawn for the AH-94 in multiplayer?
should be an option in the unit's settings
drag the allowed slots slider to the right

Is there any functional difference between a 'Player Spawn' and an 'MP Spawn'?
Yes
Player spawns dont work in MP

Do allied ships in vtol have any ground strike potential?
They'll engage some ground targets, but not with missiles
only with their guns

do you by any chance know the approximate range?
no clue, could be anywhere over 10nm lol
I will look into it

what are the values for the pac-3?
like it seems to hit mach 4+ on its booster then struggle to maintain mach 1.5 on sustainer
and if you turn even a minor amount its like subsonic

Or just a cheeky javelin missile?
Need a quick reminder, Say I have a Event sequence with a delay of 900 seconds
Entry condition is obviously conditions need to be met before delay

but does the EXIT condition basically forgoes the remaining timer and start if conditions are true?
Delay -> Wait for entry condition -> Actions -> Wait for exit condition
nothing is ever skipped

but having an exit condition is the same as having a entry condition on the next node correct?
not if there is a delay as well, as that happens before it checks the entry condition
well I have an event sequence. and I want to give the player two options, comply with the objective to land somewhere within 3 minutes and start the event

Great list, can you add dumb-fire rocket ammo to the MANPAD equipables ;)?

It does own it
Have you tried deleting the item from the workshop manually, then uploading again?

Have you tried deleting the item from the workshop manually, then uploading again?
yes, same result
Well, the log says "You're not the owner of this item.", but I don't know what "this item" it's referring to.

is it a mission from scratch?
basically yes I only took the map 'Grand Canyon' and then put all objectives enemies etc in there
When I encountered this issue, it was because the images used in the mission where too large. I think the cap is like 1-2MB. I resized all the images to 512x512p and even smaller for some others and it worked after that

What's up ya'll. If ATC doesn't answer voice comms is that just a bug or did I mess up a setting somewhere in mission editor?
Also most of the time any BGM I use is off for friends playing my missions, is that also a bug?
Also is there any way for me to test missions without actually entering them? Would save sm time

Give it a completion condition that isn't instantly satisfied?  Can you post a screenshot of the objective panel?

Give it a completion condition that isn't instantly satisfied?  Can you post a screenshot of the objective panel?
The only way it could be a mission issue is if you didn't label the airbase correctly in the map. It needs to be named in the **map**, not in the mission.
if i left itblank is it immidetly completed

Oh. you selected a player as the destroy target? Lol, I don't think it's designed for that.
Players are super unique in that they can respawn. The destroy objective isn't designed to handle that.
well what would i do to make it work

Is it just me or do Campaigns not keep their information if you save them?
I've set the damn description 7 times now
Someone else was complaining about that

the "detected by" property is affected by EOTS right?
Yes
Detection is more or less when the unit is revealed by any sensor

But is there a max number of players on a team?
That’s the only thing I could think of
It’s co-op with 9 players

Is there a way in stable mission editor for a mp mission  to change the ah-94 skin to the desert pink used in sp training?
the desert skin is used for player aircraft that are on team B
Ok thank you 👍

@Strikeeaglechase  do you know the building name ID of the airbase hangars ? I wonder if it can manually be added in a map , editing the .vt file
I don't believe they are their own static objects, so dosn't seem like its possible
they are just regular unity mesh's on the airbase

Interestingly the tutorials are static objects...? I have no idea what they do and there's no mesh for them
what are the full name of those tut ojbect ? gonna try them 😄
``` Tut_BasicFlight Tut_GettingStarted Tut_Weapons1 VFTraining1Prefab ```

what are the full name of those tut ojbect ? gonna try them 😄
``` Tut_BasicFlight Tut_GettingStarted Tut_Weapons1 VFTraining1Prefab ```
They seem very custom so probably do nothing (or completely break) if not put in the right mission. `Tut_GettingStarted` and `VFTraining1Prefab` might do nothing at all, there's some lists that are just empty for those

Anyone have any suggestions on improving a missions command chain while making a mission?
command chain?
Who’s leading what aircraft and what these aircraft role is in the mission

Ohhh that gave me an idea, I can name the slots in the editor right?
Not yet
Unfortunately not yet

Just the numbers or the letter too?
You can change the letter (what unit group they are in)
The numbers will automatically change depending on their order in the unit group

guys how do u limit the number of aircraft used by a team?
Define limit
Do you mean like, lives?

Do you mean like, lives?
He’s making some missions with me I was in front when he asked, we mean when making a multiplayer campaign is there a way to limit the total number of lives a team has instead of just giving each aircraft a life, becuase if your are playing the campaign by yourself and we limit each aircraft to one you get 4 lives becuase there are four aircraft.
How would we go about making the lives as one life pool the team shares

Why do you need a more explicit team life pool?
becuase a game dose not always have all 4 players so if there are only 3 people playing now there is one extra life that one player gets, its not a big problem if a life pool system is not in the game i just thuaght it would be better to do it that way
> becuase a game dose not always have all 4 players so if there are only 3 people playing now there is one extra life that one player gets Right. And if you instead had a shared pool of 4 lives then it would be the same with 3 players in that only one player could respawn after death.   > its not a big problem if a life pool system is not in the game i just thuaght it would be better to do it that way It's not in the game, but it's sorta possible to implement with triggers. But I'd need to know exactly how you *want* it to function to provide an implementation.

Is there a steam workshop issue?
I uploaded my map to workshop (it shows it updated 4 mins ago) but the game isn't pulling the latest version
Yep

Hey! How do I activate one of 3 available objectives randomly?
Use a conditional action with Chance conditions.
If this objective comes in the middle of the mission, put the conditional action in a complete action for another objective.

Another question. How do I trigger a PvP victory of a specific team using an action?
victory is achieved when all required objectives are complete
Ok, thanks, that will work too.

"What if everyone is dead?"
Then E4 Overlord laughs at your sorry carcasses.
I mean unless two people splash each other on the same frame it should say one team wins

Are they part of the wrong unit group? Or do you give them any other orders such as target priority?
Nope, just spawn.
I put them as a unit group AFTER finding out they took off on spawn, to see if this fixes anything, but havnt tested it since

Hello again! How do I create a custom base not from a prefab? I want to have a small FOB for VTOL vehicles which has ATC functionality and allows rearming on the helipads. So far I could only find the Big and medium airfields as prefabs in the map editor. If I don't add those, in the mission editor my "bases" tab is empty and has no option to create one.
You can place helipads under the "static objects" tab in the mission (not map) editor. Then you can create rearm points under the units tab.
There is no way to create a FOB with ATC

I see there is a system of rewards for completing objectives. But I don't see the rewarded score on the scoreboard at the end of the mission. Is there a way to see it?
Pretty sure that reward is in currency for purchasing weapons, which only works in SP.
is there any way to turn off a radar so that an ARM might miss

any way to turn off a radar in general though?
Depends on the unit. For MAD-4 Radar, the "Set Engage Enemies" action toggles their radar.
any way to do it for an S/A?

any way to do it for an S/A?
Dunno
ok

and i'm fairly sure in real life, if you turn off one radar and turn a decoy on somewhere else, it would redirect (although i might be stupid), is that possibly modelled in vtol?
ask @Strikeeaglechase , not #mission_editor
aight sorry

I'll probably need this a number of times, do you know if I reference this conditional id in multiple events, I can reuse it?
Not too hard to copy in the VTS
Create a nearly empty condition that just checks UnitNearWaypoint 88888km so it can easily be searched for, then using text editor replace that entire conditional with a copy of the one you made previously. Just be sure to update the IDs

so it's better to check for each player in your example, can't use unit list I guess?
Nah, because this kind of check would normally be a FOR loop (which doesn't exist in VTeditor)
Does NOT ALIVE also count a player that isn't occupying that vehicle slot

The Steam Workshop issue (Having to validate files) thing isn't fixed yet is it?
it just was https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444239937152352277/1009932203536424960

It really doesn't care if they rally around E1 or E2?
I want them within 100meters of either of those specific locations, so that I, as the mapper know where they'll be when I do X
might bump the number a little higher

I might have uncovered a bug, gonna have to repro this later but...  Remember my issues  earlier with the NPC Planes and a Super Carrier?  Well how that happened was I first made the a bunch of ASF-30 planes, set them to not spawn immediately, then set them on the airfield. Cold Start, Parked.  Then I attached them to the Super Carrier, which naturally moved them onto it. Did some gameplay tests, but they were spawning and attacking too aggressively so I moved them back to the air field and put a take off command on player proximity.  Now, what I forgot to do was to remove them from the Carrier Slots, but their models still showed on the airfield. This caused a secondary issue where they simply would not spawn on either the carrier or the airfield even if I had an event to spawn them.  To fix it, I simply removed their spawns from the carrier and they worked as intended.
Is it possible to download mission editor data from steam workshop? Seems I lost my campaign editor data that uploaded in the past.

Nope. There's no unitgroup fire at waypoint action because a unitgroup can contain mixed ground units besides artillery.

In pvp the wining team is the one that compelete all its required objective, correct?

Correct. Either side completing all required objectives ends the mission with their team winning. Either side failing a required objective completes the mission with the other team winning.

Send your player log after trying to upload?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

Hey! Is there a way to compare 2 global values between each other?
Not currently, but Baha expressed interest in adding the feature. https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/444150937079250945/991424667237765310 (fixed link)
Thanks! The issue I am trying to solve. 2 teams are completing objectives. If one completes all the objectives, it wins (this is easy). There is also a mission timer. And if it expires the team which completed more objectives should win. I was thinking of implementing it with comparing global values, but since it is not yet implemented, I can do it by adding 1 to a single value if team A completes an objective and subtracting 1 if team B does. But I also want in case of equal amount of completed objectives to make that the team which completed the last objective earlier to win. This I don't know how to resolve so far.

So is there any way to not have them respond like that?
Add a "last obj" GV that gets toggled every time a team completes an objective. 1 when team A, 2 when team B If timer expires, and the GV you made previously is 0 (both teams have equal objectives), then the value of the new GV determines the winner
Since you want the earlier team to score, a value of 1 means team B wins on a tie

You know about Conditional Actions?
Yes, you've taught me a couple of days ago 🙂 I got it, thanks.
If they are part of the same unit group as the player they will automatically form up on them. So either assign them to a different group or I think you can just give them an explicit command to do something else.

Couldn’t you have just made a spawn on team a but not allow players to join team a?
is the cursor heading also the ingame heading?
or make a spawn on team A that's a cold start in the air, so they crash immediately, with a briefing that just says "you joined the wrong team"

Anyone have a good way to tell wingmen to take off at your command, but otherwise stay on deck until you tell them to?
Default behavior parked?
Nope.

Well, I come to ask a question and I already see the answer. That's sad. I've been trying to use a trigger like a procedure. Having a list of actions there which needs repeated calls in the same sequence. Any alternative solution for that?
If the mission is PvE, you can create an objective on Team B with objective start actions for what you want to do, and also an action to cancel itself. Every time you want to run those actions start the objective.
My mission is PvP.

Ok, I'll try to think of something. And another question. Can I somehow make both teams lose? When I fail their main objectives in 2 consecutive actions, the second one always wins, since the first team fails the objective earlier.
nope
one team losing also causes the other team to win

Sequence can also run only once, right?
yes
Well, I've tried your first suggestion with a fake objective which gets cancelled, but in the same team. It's not too bad, since the end of my "procedure" actually results in a new objective, so the player does not see the message about the fake objective. Thanks! Should be good enough.

i figured this is probably the place to ask where can i find the stock in game missions like the desert cobra Champaign ?

@Sypwn I just want to say that I absolutely adore the Quick version of Dynamic Liberation, it's practically the only mission I host in public lobbies lately. It's great! Really renewed my fun for VTOL VR almost by itself.

normal path
railpath is old code left over in the game

Good morning.  I have a question for anyone who knows the editor pretty well.  I'm currently trying to teach myself how to use it, and I'm having difficulty with one particular issue.  I'm trying to find a way to send a list of GPS waypoints to all players of a multiplayer mission that stays available after death (or can be refreshed after death).  So far: - A proximity trigger at the MP spawns to send GPS waypoints doesn't seem to refresh on death.  (I'm assuming this can only fire once.  I don't know how to change that.) - An objective that sends the GPS waypoints as a start event doesn't seem to send them at all. I've tried slight variations of both of these, but I haven't gotten it to work yet.  If anyone knows what I'm missing here, please let me know.  Thanks.

`GPS waypoints as a start event doesn't seem to send them at all.`  is it at the start of the mission?
Trigger can only fire once unfortunately
Good to know.

To be clear, you mean for triggering the objective?
If it trigger the gps event on activation and if the objective start immediatly on mission start, yes
Okay, great.  You might have just fixed my issue, because I never thought of that.  Thanks!  I'll try it tonight.

So a second should be enough to get around the latency?
on mission start I think so
if a player would take more than 1 sec from Lobby > start > ingame, he would be screwed tho

Would this still work for people joining late?
which is apparently the golden number for Live TV delay 😄
unfortunately no

how many pepole can be on one team?
up to 16 players in a lobby, and you can split it between the teams however you want (including 16-0)

Happy to announce that my map is in Closed Beta, content is done, doing closed beta testing this weekend for performance tests and (hopefully) no bugs 🙂

is there a way to download campaigns that people have posted on the workshop in order to view how they work in the mission editor?
Afaik you would need to contact the original mission creator to get the original mission files, but I could be wrong
ok

in standalone missions, you can force a player's plane to break as an action in an event. I cant seem to find this option in the multiplayer campaign. Does anyone know where it is or how to do something similar?
Currently not possible in MP.
(I don't understand why)

im trying to prevent peopl from going above a certain altitude, how else could i do that without affecting the whole team?
Nothing clean
im just going to have to set up loads of SEAD arent I

Would that borkenness also include "within radius" triggers?
no those work fine
I am bad at conditional events confirmed 😦

then only afterward while loop is effective?
does the player spawn inside the zone?
nope

does the player spawn inside the zone?
nope
outside, drives inside

So then that means a While loop that has fired, then gone false, cannot be reactivated at any time? Say I wanted to make a wave event.
or a ...I dunno King of the Hill Event
players fighting over a zone

This one’s for the rising storm 2 fans. Just finished testing on my first legit mission/map and I wanted to share; any feedback would most certainly be appreciated.

Unfortunately the ai pathing does not seem to handle the valley well. It’s a cointoss whether the fa-26 and av-42 will actually land/bomb or just fly into a hill trying. Sometimes the fa-26 will go for bombing runs and fly over/drop flares but not actually drop bombs as well, although I’m not sure if that’s something I’m causing.
hey fellas, do you know what's involved in fulfilling the landing condition in the condition editor? is it coming to a complete stop or will it count as landing if you've touched down and you're moving at <50knots?

alright, thanks!

What exactly does stayinradius do on unit tools tab? Assume it let's the unit free roam in a specified area - and if so how do you define the radius? Thanks.
They'll continually go towards a DEFAULT WAYPOINT and never stop unless destroyed or told to do something else. They'll keep making short little "donuts" towards the waypoint, drive past, turn back towards the waypoint and try again in a small radius.
if you have the unit in a unit group, then it won't go to that waypoint unless the unit group is given the MOVE TO command

Make a mission that you would want to play yourself. If you enjoy testing it, then others will enjoy playing it

.. good missions? First make a mission, then make it harder until you cannot win alone, then add a player and move to public testing, then make it harder again, add player, rinse and repeat until the mission grows legs , and if nobody picks it up and plays it ...  start over from scratch !   After just a few you will start to make great missions !! Good Luck

Hi - been away for a while.  Has recurring / looping events been added yet - eg  if x enters y trigger  z event but it remains active unless deactivated so will trigger  multiple times. Or has there been any update /indication if it may be added in near future updates?
Literally last week. It's in public_testing
That's great news - thank you. Will just have to wait until its pushed to stable for the mission I'm working on - but I'll try it in public 👍

I cant seem to find this in a search. Will setting alt spawns for a player craft allow them to choose where they spawn?
No. The only way to do that is to create separate MP slots at each location.
Noted. Was hoping it would work similar to how the Heli works in DynLib. Thanks anyways!

But you have to tie it to a specific event, correct? Is that the same as in the chopper or if I set multiple spawns will it give an option for that airframe?
Not exactly sure what you're asking but  > Is that the same as in the chopper Spawn points behave the same regardless of what kind of aircraft it is. Dyn Lib only moving the chopper spawns was a mission design choice, not a game limitation.  > if I set multiple spawns will it give an option for that airframe? There is no way to present a spawn location option to players, beyond their choice of which aircraft slot to select in the lobby
I see. I may have misunderstood when a pilot told me he could select an airbase spawn, but what he probably meant was "once airbase is captured helis will spawn there instead of on Mom."
 Great work on DynLib btw

Yes. There is an Event Sequence dedicated to moving the chopper spawn points at the appropriate times.

Yeah would be nice to be able to set speeds and have it slow down on landing requests etc. I'm sure this is probably asked often, but is there any known plan to expand the editors capabilities?
Nothing on changing fleet speeds, but trigger looping and AI unit respawning was just finally added last week. It's in the public_testing branch right now.  My editor wishlist thread is here: https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/962116934730678332
and one of my posts there does include a request for naval unit speed options

Is there any way to set up a hard ceiling for a multiplayer mission?
I’m currently using invincible Sam sites to enforce one
There is now in the public_testing branch. You can make a looping trigger that watches for players to reach a certain altitude, then action kill them.

The ability to kill players via a trigger is coming in this next update too?
yes
Although the dev has mentioned he would prefer you kill players naturally when possible instead instead of trigger killing. For example, @Indybin using trigger looping you can make those SAMs ignore targets unless they go above a certain altitude.

Anyone know how to mimic freeflight when it comes to objectives?
I thought freeflight has no objective
well the campaign I'm working on has no objectives, but whenever I spawn in to test it the mission finishes and I can't just respawn back in when I die

is it a singleplayer campaign by chance?
I'm confused as I haven't changed anything in that area really and the last campaign I made didn't have this issue
no it's multiplayer

can you provide your player.log after playing the mission?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.
It doesn't look like you played an MP mission in this log.

uhh what do i do?
what limit did I exceed?
1: obama should be higher on the list

1: obama should be higher on the list
2. iirc thats an issue with the file size, your images probably take up too much space

if I set the carrier as the RTB waypoint will they spawn on top of eachother?
or will they spawn in correctly?
Just set the mpspawn to be on the carrier deck in its settings?

or will they spawn in correctly?
Just set the mpspawn to be on the carrier deck in its settings?
i know I can do that but I want to be able to move the spawn

Just set the mpspawn to be on the carrier deck in its settings?
i know I can do that but I want to be able to move the spawn
guess only one way to find out

Generally I would use the move spawn action to move the spawn but ig if it doesn’t work well for spawning on carriers?
You can set the player spawn point to any airfield and then edit your carrier and assign the deck locations to your players. You will then spawn on the carrier instead of the airfield however you can re-arm at that airfield in game.
This just points players to where they spawned when they press the RTB button on their NAV page. you'll have to use move spawn triggers or alt spawns to move player's spawn points around

Do you guys know if the kill player command and respawnig units is coming soon to the main branch?
whenever 1.5 goes to main branch. Anywhere from a week to a month.

Hey guys, my First Time in the Mission Editor (I'm very used to the DCS Mission Editor^^). Do I need to set which plane the player gets?   Also I can't figure out how to give the F/A-26 the IRIS-T Missile (Or AIRS-T ingame??). Only the AIM-9s and AMRAAMs show up.
are mad-4's SARH?
yes, but there is a MAD-4A variant which is active

Ok, where do I find the Player vehicle tho? Can't see it in "new unit"
here in multi
unsure about single

Yeah, got that now. Now I've got that weird Green plane. How do I set  that to the other planes?
How does that become the F/A-26 e.g.
should be in the unit settings

Or do i just spawn another plane right above it?
Hmmm
I don't see all of that

is there a particular unit limit?
Nope
Dynamic liberation I believe has over a thousand units

I have tried editing the .VTS file directly because I need to copy/paste a lot of functions (triggers only work once), but it did not take my edits once saved. Is it even possible to edit the .VTS file directly?
you need to fully close the game and reopen it to reload your changes from disk
ahh ok, will give it a try then thanks!

you can set an event for units to board an aircraft i believe

Everything looks correct here from what I know. Perhaps you also need a dropoff objective before they will board?
I do have one
with waypoint and all

does that work even without an objective?
im not sure
might

You were applying the break when you landed?
If you have a slight velocity AI will not try to board you when the door are open

is there a way to make infantry units board the closes AV-42C?
can i get to the mission editor without going into vr first?
yes

can i get to the mission editor without going into vr first?
yes
you can launch the game without the headset, and in the bottom right corner you'll see the editors

do the event triggers keep checking even after they've been triggered? or just once
Currently looping triggers are available on PTB, as a sequence event
Player or AI?

Both? Would be great if I could have players do pickups instead of the AI, but have it pick up the slack when the players don't do it
For AI, it’s an action on the infantry units to board the AV-42C. Same to disembark
For player, pickup/drop off objectives will automatically have them board your plane

Another small issue i have been having is when I try to test the scenario and launch it in the editor.  The mission fails to load in VR. Is there a specific order I should open missions in the editor/oculus/steamVR, that I need? (I usually have them all closed) I'll put the headset on an only see my monitors.
No. VR should work fine when launched from the editor. Please post your log.
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

What headset do you have? Does VR work normally before you enter the editor?
I have the oculus quest. I open in in VR, but when I click to the editor it switches to desktop and the headset comes off. I have the issue after that. When I put the headset back on it shows my monitors in 2d VR mode. I'll check about the log.
It's normal for the editor to only show on the monitor. But the VR should return as soon as you exit the editor back to the menu, or when you start testing a mission. (The helmet room should be in VR)

could I just have a single waypoint to act as a battle locus of sorts?
the naval fleets move towards the waypoint, and all associated aircraft orbit around it
I think what you're describing is basically just patrol paths

Hey all another question I couldnt find an answer for. I want to drop off troops on a carrier. I saw some chat in here saying it needed to be a static object in order for it to work but the only static object for sea in the editor is an oil platform. any suggestions?
I think they mean it has to be not moving. I haven't messed with dropping off troops myself, but theoretically as long as it's stopped in a known location, you can put a waypoint there as a dropoff destination.
hmm ok, I set a waypoint but it just kind of hovers. it doesnt set itself on the carrier so i didnt know if it would trigger the drop off. Ill try that and see what happens

If you don't check the allow reloads on a mad4 / Sam launcher does it just fire at random intervals rather than a set reload time. I've had Sam lnr  fire repeated times without the allow reload box being checked?
Afaik each launcher has a number of missiles available for it to fire, kind of like a magazine. Allow reload just lets it refill that magazine after a period of time once fully depleted
Thanks Smol 👍

I am looking for some help on how to start with GPS coordinates in the GPS system for target groups in the aircraft. Can someone walk me through how I would set that up in the mission editor to start the mission with these GPS targets already in the aircraft?
singleplayer or multiplayer mission?
Multiplayer mission

Hmmm it shouldn't be aircraft dependent right?
Are you creating them right at the start of the mission? I put it on a 3 sec delay from mission start to ensure the aircraft has loaded in.
It won't affect players who aren't fully loaded in their aircraft when it triggers.

I'm trying to play a custom map but I need to make a mission, how do I quickly make a free flight mission?
Uhhhh... create a singleplayer mission, select your map, add a player spawn point, save, then launch a test run
Yeah but I'm trying to fly a jet, not use a helicopter

can i test a multiplayer mission in multiplayer without uploading it first?
As much as I know, No.
You can upload and immediately change it to ~~hidden~~ unlisted or friends only through steam

can you change the order of listed missions in a campaign?
Yes, Maravrin, you can click and drag the missions to whatever order you like. 🙂
lol THanks

Is there an easy way to get a "high quality" Image of a map your using for briefing purposes?
I use the minimap tool in the mission editor
interesting Ill give that a try. Thanks Sypwn... Eagle Dynamics should pay you for the amount of help you give

Wondering if anyone else has had this problem? Whenever I try to reset the player vehicle I can't type a heading, speed, or fade time. Every time I enter a number it just sets it to 0.
Odd
try restarting the game?

Is there any other way to reset the player to another spot?
Is this a singleplayer mission?
Yes

Is this a singleplayer mission?
Yes
I didn't even know "resetting" a player was an option. In SP, once the player dies, the mission fails.

Maybe wait for the player to return to a waypoint after each wave?
Or you could make it an MP mission and have the player eject to reset.
It can be an MP mission with only one slot.

Are we talking about a player? Or an AI unit?
A player
But only send it to the player that entered it

How do I get the drone carrier to use its drones offensively?
I'm trying to make the ship engage an allied cruiser, to send out its drones to attack it

can someone help me with having AI taxi and takeoff using paths?
The AI will taxi/takeoff themselves, you just command them to takeoff
You don't manually create the paths for em

Yep all AI aircraft will taxi on their own
thank you

@Strikeeaglechase how would you make an AI (in my case a B-11 Bomber) bomb a certain area?

Does the current or PT mission editor have a way to detect and codify number of players that are in a game?  I have another way to do it, but I was hoping for something more streamlined.

UnitList (check all players) number alive greater/less than...
It will count players that are alive and spawned in

That actually begs the question how it looks at ALL type conditionals.  I know with AI it considered both spawned and unspawned units.        Example: group alpha is 4 player mp spawns. I have the conditional event: trueIF(ALL(Group_Alpha)=near_wpt).   If I only have only 3 players, would it be able to print true if the 3 players meet the conditional?
Lol nvm, even if it works the same as AI, I can still make a conditional flow that considers all options.
For ALL conditionals, it looks at all units regardless of alive or dead. So for `ALL (players) Near Waypoint` to be fulfilled, all player slots would have to be occupied and spawned in.

hey fellas, do lots of road being placed in a map have a significant impact on performance/frame rate in missions?
Not much, but I'm sure if you stack enough in a small area they will. L'etranger has built entire structures out of roads.
Cool, then I doubt what i'm up to will affect performance too much

Hi i started 3 days ago with the editor. I got tanks running into buildings. Path is set in linear but still they do continue. How ca.n i solve this? Also what are all the other path options like follow and Railpath? Whats thw difference there?
IIRC Railpath is something leftover and shouldn't be used, and units don't care about your placed buildings they just drive through everything no way around that but moving the paths themselves
Hey is there any reason that when I try to upload my mission to Steam Workshop I get "Error: Limit Exceeded". Has this ever happened to anybody?

Hey is there any reason that when I try to upload my mission to Steam Workshop I get "Error: Limit Exceeded". Has this ever happened to anybody?
The answer is that your mission/campaign's primary image is larger than 1MB
Thanks @Sypwn , I found that if I used a smaller image but tried uploading from within the mission editor it wouldn't change. You have to edit from within the campaign editor for anybody who gets the "Error: Limit Exceeded" and doesn't find a fix in the future.

Maybe define an exit condition as 'MP_Spawn 5' IS NOT locking target 'ON'. Wont the trigger hang indefinitely waiting for an exit condition to 'end' the sequence?
When you talk about "turning on" and "turning off" the respawning of the tank, are you stopping and starting any sequences? Or are you only toggling the value of that GV?
Also, the respawner sequence should have an exit condition of waiting for the tank to be dead. Otherwise it will run every second trying to spawn the tank over and over even when it's still alive, which will spam your player log.

I am solely just changing the GV, figured it would work just with that. Should I also stop and start the event as well?

No, I was just making sure. Next step would be to search for sequence entries in the player log
Was gonna do this

Hey, how do I use this thing?
Uhh you'll need nodejs installed, maybe ill setup a simple website to convert easier
@ISEGaming if you can create a test mission that recreates the logic you're having trouble with, then zip that up and upload it, that would be very helpful.

@Sypwn what sort of validation would be useful? First thing I thought of was checking `unitInstanceID` to make sure all IDs are unique
Validation on what?
VTS file

Oh, lol. If you wanted to make a tool to assist mission creators in doing things that are tedious in the VTEdit, that would be awesome. Validation, copying/moving actions and conditionals, reassigning conditionals, etc. But for a VTS-JSON converter? It's not as important.  If you want to have it validate as many IDs as you can, that would be cool. Unit instances, conditionals, conditional action blocks.
> that would be awesome Issue is thats all UI heavy
which I suck at lmao

Could you send me a vts file with such errors so I can test?
Tomorrow. I'm too tired to think now
I just so happen to be a front-end web developer, and I often make my own UI's, so I can help ya there 🙂

So you mean a unique numerical value used for referencing? Yes
And again, there are over a dozen different types of IDs in a VTS file. Units, waypoints, objectives, paths, bases, static objects, timed events, conditional events, event sequences, conditions, conditional actions nodes, global values...
some have useful unique names like `unitInstanceID`, but most just say `id`

what would you need from me if I made a very basic front-end?
I could do it myself if I had the motivation. I just haven't had a real need, and the fact that I have to completely quit and relaunch the game to load changes from disk means it would be a real hassle to use regardless.
prolly just gonna make a intex.html file with some css

like sort all (Unit/objectives/etc) Alpha?
thanks for the info Neo.
hello. My editor seems not to save the image and description in the Mp mission editor.  Am i doing something wrong? Also on steam it does jot show an image unless you actually click on the link to the map in the workshop. Hope someone can give me a clue on solving that. Thanks

strange. It makes it at every time i use the editor. Thanks anyhow for the quick reply.

im trying to make a mp "campaign"(its just one mission) but i cna only place one spawn point and even when its placed it still says theres an error  any help?
I'm assuming you've selected the Multiplayer option, so I'd assume that maybe you put down a SP spawn point and forgot to delete it? Other than that, I'm not sure.
i can only place sp spawn point and i DID make it an mp campaign so unless i am missing something and cant find the mp spawn points i dont know what to say

i can try
thats if i can find the folder again

You sent me a normal standalone singleplayer mission. You sure this was in your campaigns folder?
It doesn't show up ingame for me if I put it in my Campaigns folder
THERE IS NO CAMAIGN FOLDER

I agree ... wut ?
uh idk just send an image of what you have it set up as
pick up objective, set ur conditions then select the troops u pickup

Can you post a screenshot here?
i wa bouta say
havent even lost my nitro yet and people are already ignoring my existence again -_-

These are the options offered ?
and there arent any other missions yet
Yup

Before I get them to load ?
no
can u get vc?

any of that not make sense at all?
Thanks ... now lets see how much I absorbed  .. ha ! I will check back L8r
yes it was good

What if you put them under tabs listed across the top of the screen?
Because my units list is like 700 units long
Is this an external mission editor?

Is there anyway to detect when the player ejects?
You can check if the player is dead, but I don't think you can see if they ejected afterwards.

Is there anyway to detect when the player ejects?
You can check if the player is dead, but I don't think you can see if they ejected afterwards.
Only with single player maps if you use the conditionals to check if the player uses the ejection handle.

What are you more generally trying to do?
Just trigger an event when the player either dies or ejects. It’s easy to do on player death but I’m trying to figure out how to trigger it on an ejection as well since dying from a missile is rare
And also have it triggered before the player respawns

hey guys I'm trying my hand at making a mission, I used to make broodwar maps so I'm fairly savvy,  but if there was a website or wiki I can look at and how to make the map a multiplayer app?
"map not app
Ejection counts as death.

Hi, How to a change all the MP spawn points in the MP mission? I want to change the spawn points from the starting missions airport to an airport that has been taken over. The spawn points for each players should then be there permanent.  Thanks in advance for the help.
There is an event to change the spawn. But you have to set an alt spawn in the unit editor
Great. found it. Thanks !!!!!!!👍

Is there a way to adjust the volume of custom audio files in the mission editor? Because the voice lines and stuff im using are all easily 3 times louder than ingame voicelines when I launch the missions...
Not through the editor. Just fix them using Audacity
I see. so I need to use third party means then... thats a shame and extremely tedious, given its over 20 files.

thanks for the help yesterday guys.  I'm playing with the map editor running a "capture " the bases map. ie have 5 airports on a map, and teams can take over/retake 3 of airfields. once a team has 4 airfields the game is over   Is this something the editor can handle? I know it can do single take overs, plenty of maps have this feature already, but can it change sides multiple times?  another question would be respawning the base defenses everytime it changes sides, is this also possible?
just before I go to far making placeables for something unachievable
Both of these (recapturable bases and respawning units) are possible but only in the new VTOL version 1.5 in public_testing. People are already starting to build MOBAs and stuff.

Quick question related to separated briefings; other than checking separated briefings in the editor is there anything else preventing the host from choosing the room type?  I have separate rooms unchecked in the editor and it’s false in the vts file, but it won’t let me chose the room when launching from the editor or hosting privately on the ptb
I believe if there are too many player slots you are forced to use the large combined
Since the separate briefing rooms supports only 12 people (6 per team) I believe

quick question: is there a way to count the player's kills?  I want a certain voice line to play after the player shot down 2 or 3 enemies, but i cant figure that out.  I can make voice lines play if certain enemies are shot down in general by anyone, but not the player specifically.  basically... how do I detect if the player made the kill, and not one of the npc's?

In an MP mission you can track how many kills the players together have gotten by using the score feature. But I don't think there is a way to detect which unit or player got a single kill.
ah, I see...  since its a single player mission, I guess Im... probably gonna have to see about being creative some other way.  though, good point on the score feature via multiplayer... maybe I can convert the map to be multiplayer capable, while still using that feature... hmm...

I used one from the workshop
Hmm. I haven't done that myself yet.

Do you think I should try to remake the mission on a different map?
If you can wait a day or two, I can try to experiment with workshop maps and see if it's a limitation.

I haven't been able to reproduce your error. Campaigns containing workshop maps seem pretty resilient.

@Strikeeaglechase @Sypwn following up, anything else needed on this UI? I'd like to get this thing rolling.
probably should have a separate thread for it
I extremely rarely use the editor so I cannot comment

Does the "Sort IDs" tab let you drag and drop the units around?
But I thought you would be the one implementing the thing
yes

Alhough it might be faster in this app. thoughts?
Bulk rename, maybe. But I wouldn't bother with features that exist in the editor.
Bulk rename would be nice, not sure how to go about doing that, other than a search and replace

of whats currently being dragged?
yeah
kk

i think i know the answer but just to be sure, let's say someone hipotheticaly had to format it's pc and forgot to backup the editors custom missions.. its there a way to retrieve them ?

On average how long does it take for a ship to fully sink in game?
And if an infantry goes underwater do they immediately die as well?
They half sink, then stay there for a while, then eventually despawn I think? Not sure on the timing.

erm... ok, just a precautionary question, but if I've published a scenario... and I lost the custom scenario files... how exactly could you get those files back? or is that scenario now just... dead and non-updatable?  havent happened to me, but im just curious.
There's not *really* a way
just backup your mission files always

To be honest though, im useless at scripting (if I wanna do it myself)... but Im still curious regardless, lol. How would a script help recover the files? I know you can get the custom scenario and custom map files in steam's workshop folders, but yeah... thats about it
> How would a script help recover the files? The files on the workshop are basically encrypted, the script undoes that
After that your left with just a regular mission that you can edit

I have just found out about this feature for Visual Studio Code? SliptUp, SplitDown, SplitLeft, SplitRight
That`s before you load the File You can have different files open on one window without using the Tab above to choose the file to look for.
What does this have to do with the mission editor?

You will see in 1 minuet
So if you look at the text file names I can have all open in one windows so in the Image belows I could have a Mission Todo list this could inclused OBjectives and how many units per Enemy or Allied

How do I exit mission testing? Is there anyway to force end the mission and go back to the editor?
Nevermind. You just have to press Delete
is it possible to open steam workshop missions in the editor?

I would assume so. You could probably run a test for that with tutorial messages.    I never used the initial delay thing because I can just.. you know, add? If I want the actions to delay after the event is triggered, I just add that to the time delay of each action.
In the editor when you put in for example like 300 for something like a trigger, it’s 300 meters right? It’s not like unreal engine where every unit is actually like like 2 centimeters or some bs?
yeah editor is almost entirely in meters

yeah editor is almost entirely in meters
There's a measuring tool in one of the top menus.

is there an opfor tanker for refueling?
Doesn't seem to be.
damn

I have also noticed if you change the Delay for each event they move out of order not sure if you have seen or noticed this?
For example if you where to change there delay to 600s = 10 mins or 300s = 5 mins
Are you referring to timed events?

Are you referring to timed events?
In a timed event group, the specified delay for each node is relative to the start of the event (after the initial delay). So for a timed event group like this:
```T+0   - Mission start (nothing happens) T+120 - GAV-25 spawns in T+150 - GAV-25 takes off T+180 - GAV-25 moves to attack player```

So if you and another player would play you both would have to complete objectives related to your Mission if one player has completed all objectives but not Return to carrier Objective then the hole mission fails and the 2nd player can no longer complete the Scenario Missions?
For testing how ever I let AI take out Golf then I will take to the air with my wingmen to take out India Enemy`s this will not be available in the Steam workshop update release both players must spawn in.
even if you spawn in on your own you would have to wait for Either Bravo Player or Sierra Player to spawn depending what unit you chose.

So How I want it to work is Only Bravo Mission Objectives will be visible ok obj screen of the aircraft when they all completed there mission there mission trigger would Stop and Sierra Mission would Start then all of Bravo Objectives are not showing only Sierra Objectives are showing?
> So How I want it to work is Only Bravo Mission Objectives will be visible ok obj screen of the aircraft when they all completed there mission there mission trigger would Stop and Sierra Mission would Start then all of Bravo Objectives are not showing only Sierra Objectives are showing?  I can't decipher this sentence. Is it missing punctuation?
As when I have tested instead of it saying Bravo Takeoff , Bravo Defeat Enemy Golf, I notice that the only objective that shows is Sierra Defeat India

Obj is short for Objectives on the aircraft main screen with all opstions

```mips so what if I dont want any Objectives or missions to start until the timed event is over? ```
Then you set `Start Mode: Triggered` and use triggers to activate them with the timer.
are conditions still relevant or only used for like combat in the air, So for example Golf is num allive = 0, then Objective Bravo Return, but cancels all other objectives that are no long needed as all enemy aircraft are dead.

Or how does the Objectives get completed?
I have never gone into detail before
> are conditions still relevant or only used for like combat in the air Yes, for objectives that do not fit into the standard objective types.  > So for example Golf is num allive = 0 That sounds like a Destroy objective would work, but you can still use a conditional if you prefer.  > then Objective Bravo Return Then *what* Objective Bravo Return? I think you're missing a verb?  > but cancels all other objectives that are no long needed as all enemy aircraft are dead. I know you tried to explain your mission earlier, but it takes me too much effort to decipher your writing. You can make the completion of one objective complete the others, or cancel them. If you cancel other objectives then they can't be used for prerequisite objectives, as they have to be completed to count toward the prerequisite.

it certainly wouldn't hurt

Through discord I mean in VC for the mic so I can hear what your saying as when I will be in mission editor, I will not see chat and it will be disabled also
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

I forgot to ask where can I find the wiki for VTEditor?
https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor
Thanks

Is there anybody here who have had Event Sequence experiences?
yes many people do
I just need one of them for support at this moment in time.

Are you able to join VC so I can screen share?
it is 1 AM
Its 04:55 AM for me

Ok what would you call Military Time?
What?
Anyway we are off topic

So I the images I have added Do I still need to add the Objectives to Sequence Event or no?
I am sort of confused about this as I have set the events in the Objectives themselves.
You can set the events in the objektive and only trigger the objektive in the first node.  Second node seems to be conditional so I would not touch it.

1. Place players and friendly units. 2. Place enemies to kill. 3. Create objective to destroy enemy units. 4. Profit?
Also, <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor>
is it possible to create an objective for locating something

have you clicked on the success condition in the editor?
i've just been reading the wiki page
and related crosslinks on the page that say mission editor/dsfahjkf

so things are going well, I have the spawn groups set up to push unit spawns to newly owned / fall back posiitonds depending on objectives etc. but for some reason all the planes are ignoring alt spawn 1 for default and starting on 2 any ideas?
I'm makign a tug of war style map for PVP with PVE components. Each team has 3 air bases and as you loose one your spawns are pushed back to the next one. Or forward to the next. It seems to work fine other than the starting locations are being ignored in favor for spawn 2 at start.
What probability is alt spawn 2 set to?

What probability is alt spawn 2 set to?
90
1-4 is 100/90/80/70

and its only using alt-spawn 2?
yeah without fail
even though it has 4 configured?

even though it has 4 configured?
do you have *any* `force alt spawn` triggers?
A ton, but they don't com into play until either the timer after spawn (2 minutes) or a base is destroyed

do you have *any* `force alt spawn` triggers?
A ton, but they don't com into play until either the timer after spawn (2 minutes) or a base is destroyed
I can tell that it's choose 2 even in the lobby because I set each spawn locaiton to have a different number of available lives

I don't think the triggers can start until the host hits start match right?
oh, these are *players* with alt-spawns?
yea

oh, these are *players* with alt-spawns?
yea
I could try putting the probability of the other spawns to like 1

I am a little confused and hoping someone could help clear up my confusion. How do I design a multiplayer mission? The game officially supports multiplayer now but I can't find an option to make missions multiplayer. Am I missing something?
I try to add a second spawn point and it tells me I cannot do that.
You need to create a new Campaign. There you can toggle on multiplayer.

Oh, can't make single missions (custom scenarios) multiplayer?
You can have a single mission in a campaign
right of course, but was in custom scenario design mode

is there a way to use said map in making a new mission?
you can use it in a mission, but you can't edit it
is there a way to use a map that was used in a seperate mission? im trying to use the nyc map in a different mission

is there a way to use a map that was used in a seperate mission? im trying to use the nyc map in a different mission
Not officially
well damn, looks like ima have to try and remake it myself

Is this your first mission?
You could also ask the creator of that map if they are willing to share it.
no ive made a couple of missions before but they were all very quick'

I know the max player limit for a server is 16, but can you have more slots for players than that in the mission? I'm trying to do something with multiple spawns for different airbases around the map
Yeah, you can have as many player spawn slots as you want.
If you edit the .vts, you can make their starting lives 0 so they can only be used after progressing in the mission

have you had it to where on the enemy's screen they the "mission failed" after destroying a target, but it having not been the actual end of the mission? but their waypoints on the team that received it no longer have objectives, and everyone can spawn in and out normally as if the misison still is live?
nope
well glad to be breaking new ground haha

does anyone know why this is happening?
What are the targets?
players

should something like this work?
yes
Wait, maybe

so should i do total score?
yes
and in the mission options you set how many points kills and deaths are worth

what if i have like 200 NPCs also on the field?
oh, not sure
and i just want to count player deaths

Is that in an experimental branch?
yeah, #public_testing
it will probably be there for a while

Oh and one last thing. Does this count deaths as points for the enemy? Or for the team that its set to.
Because if this is right, that could mean i could count it as if killing NPCs doesnt give points but killing players does
deaths credit points to the opposing team

We are talking about the MP Stats conditions, right? I think it looks at the scoreboard and counts all the listed deaths on that team. So it won't count players that haven't spawned, but I also don't think it will count players that have died then quit the lobby.
alright, thanks for the help
If I have an AI aircraft (F-45A in this case) start cold, and I tell it to vertical take off, how long will it take to get running?

Also, if I command a sea group to move to a waypoint, will they move in formation or collide into each other?
i am once again doing stuff in the editor and i have run into a peculiar problem I have two objectives that both have a 50% chance of beginning. Plan is to have an RTB objective that comes after the completion of the 2 new objectives.  However, because both have a 50% chance of starting in the fist place, how do i make it so that you either have to complete the triggered mission/ both missions/ or just start the rtb objective if neither of the two have triggered?

(not a mission maker), maybe make it so that the RTB only requires 50% off all objectives to be completed?

Convoy 1 is started directly after reaching the waypoint and after it has been completed, Convoy 2 and Escort both have a 50% chance of happening after Con 1

@Sypwn sorry to ping ya, but would you perhaps happen to know how to go about this?
anyone?
One sec

is that last image from a seperate conditional event? The current Trigger for the convoy and Escort are the ones that decide wether or not to spawn them
The last image is whatever conditional checks if RTB should start
(wrong reply, whoops)

so this means that RTB begins as soon as either Obj 1/2 reach Value 2?
in theory this should be able to work now
Alternative method

dumb question, but how do i get to that if else editor?
the fact that i've never managed to spot it confuses me greatly
That's a conditional action. How else are you rolling objectives using chance??

That's a conditional action. How else are you rolling objectives using chance??
are you perhaps avaiable to discuss this in VC1 or something, im still a bit confused
i've tried to do the 2nd method

so as i understand it, is this trigger completely irrelevant now?
and the 50 Roll begins with the completion of the first destruction objective
leaving me in the end with the RTB condition that is triggered once the aforementioned objectives have reached Value 0

how does one go about making said sequencial event?
Events -> Event Sequences -> New Or something like that. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor/Events#Sequence>
everything seems to mostly be in working order now, so finishing up that event and polishing a few rough edges and the mission should be complete

My first custom multiplayer map & scenario! Tug of War - 8v8. PVP & PVE:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2869741013&searchtext=  I worked all weekend on this and I'm pretty proud of it.  A chain of islands where 2 teams fight over control of a total of 6 bases. Kind of like a MOBA were each base has to be taken before the next one.  Offence base Oscar > Defence Base Delta > Home.  Both sides have identical, symmetrical logic programmed into their mission objectives. So both sides have an equal opportunity.  When Oscar is destroyed it starts a chain of other objectives for both teams, the team winning gets a ground sneak attack on their offensive base they have to go back to handle, and the team that lost their offensive base gets the opportunity to complete an objective to launch their navy and carrier fleet.   Taking of the first base allows the team that won that enagement to spawn at the newly taken base, but if their offensive base gets captured they no longer can spawn there. etc.    There are other objectives that happen when triggered like a bomber squadron launching, extra lives per base capture that add up, etc.  Feedback is appreciated. I think I've worked out all the bugs.
Does this need VTOL v1.5?
is this good?

I dunno, I played it Sunday morning. I assume everyone was on the same version due to steam updates?

I dunno, I played it Sunday morning. I assume everyone was on the same version due to steam updates?
1.5 is the version in public_testing that supports looping triggers and respawning units. Impressive to make a tug of war map without these.
No. Conditional actions only fire once, instantly when they are activated. If you want the sequence to __wait__ for something to happen, then you have to put that condition in an entry or exit condition.

Question, i'm working on an even trigger that tells people to stay below 1000ft ASL. once it triggers though thats it, it won't trigger again if they fly below and then go back up. Any way to re-set the trigger so it can be used again and again? I tried set event = enable on a seprate timed event to re-enable the first one but that didnt' seem to help
Once a trigger is triggered, it can't be activated again
As Shadow stated, triggers can't be reactivated or looped.  ...unless you are using the new public_testing branch. VTOL v1.5 finally adds looping trigger support so you can do exactly what you want with a looping event sequence.

okay feeling dumb, where do I put breifing room MP3's ? hah
I tried putting them where the breifing room image is but no luck finding it in editor
EditorResources, same place as the images

Is it possible to edit a map used on a mission WITHOUT breaking the mission?
i made a mission and after bringing it into multiplayer everyone said it was one sided, so i need to add some cover
yeah, that's what repack does

So I have been playing with number of units and want to get an idea of how many total active units you all use in your missions? I try to keep mine in between 80 to 100 for performance reasons. My system can handle more but other players cannot come to find out. Curious as to what everyone uses as their standard?
Not all units have the same performance cost.  Players > AI Aircraft > AI Ground/Naval > Stationary  16 players vs 20 AI aircraft will perform far worse than 2 players vs 200 tanks
thx for the tip

What's the approximate detection range on the opfor Drone Carrier?
Aircraft detecting the carrier? Or the carrier detecting players?
My bad, the carrier detecting players

Aircraft detecting the carrier? Or the carrier detecting players?
My bad, the carrier detecting players
Depends on the player's RCS. I've never used the drone carrier, but it looks like it's based on the DMS Cruiser . It probably shares the same radar, which is much weaker than NMSS Cruiser.

Is there any way to send commands to the drones launched from a drone carrier?
again, never used em. Sorry
If there is, it would have to be though commands on the carrier host

Has anyone seen this before? I'm on Win11
Yeah, I noticed this as well. Use SteamVR for creating and testing missions.
Like Boot Steam VR, then VTOL VR?

Like Boot Steam VR, then VTOL VR?
Oh, for some reason I thought you said you were using the `oculus` launch option. It only happens for me when I do that. Check if you have the oculus launch option enabled, and if so, remove it.
Nope, stock boot options

Is SteamVR launching when you start the game?
No
Ok, then you have to force SteamVR to start somehow.

Is there a way to disable NVG in a mission using a script line in the  .vts file? Want to do a Tornado GR1 mission where there is no night vision capability. I realise I could just trust people to not use it....
Nooooooooope
Hello Editors. Is there a way to assign a task and setting the waypoint automatically? As an exemple. Alpha needs to run the mission objective Air to Air. While Xray needs to go for another objective. That means that when the first objective for Alpha starts it puts the waypoint for the first mission in the MFD for the objectives. A bit later I have a time trigger to make Xray start and go for their objective. Problem is that Alpha now sees the Xray objective. The goal here is that only the team the mission is assigned for sees its objective(waypoint) in the HUD and MFD objective screen. (I know that the other objectives would still be visible in the MFD screen, which is the way it works).

Now THIS is podracing! - 3 new maps pulled directly from the 1999 video game!  After the inspiring work of gandalfnog on the original Tatooine map based on the movie. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2797075913  I thought it would be fun to re-create the game version of these iconic race maps!  The issue with the original map was it had weapons, which turned many matches just into dog fights and the podracing went to the way side. Also it had no checkpoint spawns so if you died you just had to wait the match out.  On my version: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2871110672 The maps, sounds, descriptions, are all pulled directly from the 1999 game. Every turn and visual style replicated using the map creator's height map tool then smoothed out by me.  The only thing I can't do are overhangs and tunnels so you get a lot of canyons.  3 maps:  Mon Gazza - Desert map deep within the spice mines. There are several splits and routes you can take. Some more direct but with traps. Some safer but slower.  Boonta Clasic - Your standard Tatooine race map with canyons, Tusken raiders, obstacles and lots of twists and turns.  Beedo's Wild Ride - A snow map circling the high peek of Ando Prime. As it's white walled you may have issues following portions of the course. Do your best to not run into a wall!

Thats what I thought. Thanks anyhow for replying.

is it possible to turn of the mission editor hud so i can make screenshots of the mission for the briefing? I dont  want my brief images to look like *this*
Use the map editor? The units will be missing, but the briefing images are so small anyway no one will notice.
what about for images of stuff like the AWACS or carrier?

In the public testing branch there is an action to kill a player

Bit of a silly question, but how do multiplayer missions work? I can only make one player spawn, did I miss an option for single player/multiplayer when making the mission or something?
got to make it a campaign
even with just one mission in it

Does this work with old missions too?
as in made before the MP update?
Yes

as in made before the MP update?
Yes
They may be broken for other reasons

Hello, is there a way to stop a long time burning Flare and start a flare with a different color? or do they burn the whole time you set as burn time?
yeah, they burn the whole time as far as i know
In VTOL v1.5 (in public_testing), you can make a looping trigger, which allows you to continually reignite short-lived flares and change the color based on a conditional action or end it after some condition is met.  But in the current stable version of VTOL, you pretty much have to commit to a single color and duration.

Killbox MP coming soon? 👀
Looking forward to 1.5 🙂
Tried killbox in the mp mod and it wasn't the best mp mission tbh

Damn it. i lost my mission. The files are gone. is there any way to retrieve them from Steam?
@Strikeeaglechase can recover if you can prove they're yours
Thanks for the quick reply. i will contact him.

How do I set up multiple player spawns for MP missions?
To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign. 2. Import your mission into that campaign via the campaign editor. 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer via the campaign editor.
Does the same method work with a singular mission?

Does the same method work with a singular mission?
Yes. You cannot make a standalone multiplayer mission, only multiplayer campaigns.
So you have to convert it to a campaign, then convert it to multiplayer.

I'm confused. How do I use a map I downloaded from the Steam workshop? I clicked subscribe, but from there in the game, dunno how to open it
When you go to make a new mission, the map will be selectable from the list of maps
At the veeeeeeery bottom, so it's extra convenient.

i dont half of the buttons??
That's already a mutiplayer campaign
i didnt set up the mission in a campagin

@Sypwn how many units are there in the single sector dynamic liberations?
math
guesstimate

can I select multiple units and make changes to them?
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/1026912089425592372
Nope

how many units do you have spawned at one time?
in dynlib quick
didn't you just ask me that?

didn't you just ask me that?
yeah, but you said not at one time
hold on

so some of them aren't spawned right?
It's random, and it involves math, and I'm tired
lol fair enough

Is there way to set diffferent objectives for different groups?
nope
damn

Wym? Are you telling me that some people *don't* read the brief? That's simply insane

What???? that simple 😛 Nice. Thanks.
question, for something like this, if i set it to enemy units, will a Bulwark, the enemy overlord, be set off by units on B team because they are technically the enemy team? or will it be set off by things on the A team since the A team is the enemy of that unit
"Allied" in this context means Team A

"Allied" in this context means Team A
im trying to make it so where the voiceline "Leans on overlord" is actually forced to happen, instead of what usually happens with the bulwark where it just says nothing

other thing, if i set an event trigger, will that trigger loop if the conditions are meant again? or will it just say the line once and never again
Only once ever
In the next version of VTOL in public_testing, you can make looping event sequences

could anyone help me? my friend is trying to make a mission and he wants to make it dynamic and neither of us know how to do it
If that isn't the hint you need, then you should probably start with something simpler and work your way up.
thank you

would I do that for every one of them?
Every time you need to make something random or dynamic
Here is some of the event sequence for spawning city targets in Sector A. Note the scroll bar. It is very long.

does anyone know if there is a # players check slotted for the next update? The looping function is going to be great for filling in empty slots with AI aircraft, but the "units alive" check is not going to be sufficient if players die.
What's wrong with "units alive"?
If I want to run a looping check to see number of human players, it will give bad values if it checks after a player is shot down and before he respawns

What's wrong with "units alive"?
If I want to run a looping check to see number of human players, it will give bad values if it checks after a player is shot down and before he respawns
trigger kill the AI whenever the player spawns

Does anyone have a visual representation of the field of view of the fire control radar?
big cone
just one very large cone

What is that 15 degrees?
Thx
Uhhh 10 degrees I think

Hey, in the mission editor you can make an action in a trigger 'send path to GPS' and then choose a target group#. This doesn't seem to work in multiplayer. I'm not seeing any path in GPS for any of my player aircraft groups. Am I missing something?
That's for single player AFAIK. Some objects you can trigger don't have specific players in mind, those are only for single player. This would also be for triggers that "open canopy" or "launch bar" etc because there's no specific player it references, it means for the single player. How I understand it.
Cool, that makes sense

anybody know why the images I put for the briefings in my missions arent showing up for my friend? they show for me but not for him
Never encountered that before. What mission?

hmm

Can you send me the .vts file?
(here or pm)
uhh how do I get that

@BahamutoD how did this happen?
for some reason only the blufor image is in the example folder
mmn ungh vtole worky game

it had another image in there but the mf just went and dipped?? dunno where hes goin but hes goin
Close the game. Move the correct `IslandsAtWar.PNG` and `IslandsAtWarOpfor.PNG` files into that folder. Replace the vts file with this one.
alright, thanks

Wait, why do you have steam installed into your user folder??
whuh
Whatever. Probably not worth fixing anyway.

what is the sivice celing of the E-4?
Dunno. Experiment yourself, or ping Chase.
Units cannot spawn higher than 33 000ft

what if i make a mountan and plan it on top?
Mountains only go to 6000m
Spawn altitude to 10 000m

so i cant get an extra 6000m?
No
10 000m ASL

is it posible to set a gps mark on the ground and have ai ground usints go there?
Just use waypoints, then use the move to waypoint function within the unit movement
no i want to tell them where to go from inside the mission

Can you edit the health values of units in the .vts to make them harder to kill in a multiplayer mission?
No, but you can toggle their invincibility.
For example, with a group of multiple units, you can make a sequence that temporarily makes them all invincible when one of them dies. This slows down anyone attempting to kill them all.

what does the "weight" do in alternate spawns? say, if one was on 100, and the other 90, what would happen when someone spawns in would they go to the one with 100 weight every time?
I thought probabilities were completely intuitive for you 🤔 `Weight` is how many marbles are in the bag to represent each alt-spawn. Spawn 1 : Weight 100 Spawn 2: Weight 200 means there is a 1/3 chance of spawning at spawn 1, and a 2/3 chance of spawning at spawn 2.
i didnt know it was probability (also, didnt mean to offend with my comment in the wishlist), I thought it was a hierarchy system. Thank you for the insight 😄 👍

Player? They are usually used for AI units to randomize where they spawn.
but no, this makes much more sense
Never used em for players

in what order will players spawn into them, numerical?
so MP Spawn 1 first, then 4 then 5 etc?
Each MP spawn unit represents a separate vehicle slot in the briefing room

ok. So if i chose the top slot, it would put me in the corresponding group at the first available spawnpoint?

Just click the test mission button and see for yourself
It should all make sense

Yes, but are you using steamvr through oculus?
not to matter, i can just upload to the workshop and then playtest in a private lobby
you have to dont you?

you have to dont you?
That's a real hassle
meh i dont mind

what im saying is, its not possible to use vtol vr without it isnt it?
ah i have that
i shall change it

yes, that's what `oculus` mode does

You made the podrace map?
How did you stop people from taking off early?
ok, quick question...  I wanna make a tutorial map for some friends, and I can do most of the things in the mission editor now, but... I cannot make short gifs/videos pop up to explain what to do like in the game's official tutorials.  am I maybe missing something?

The in game tutorials don't have any gif/video's pop up

what do you mean? see if its hidden within the game files?
I can extract that tutorial's vts file from the game files, then see which trigger action it calls to show the video. Then I can try to use that trigger action in a custom mission.
ok, yeah, im not insane.  it'd be nice if it was an official feature tho,

how do you go about doing that?
i can never find the heightmap and vts files of ingame levels for some reason
You have to datamine a bit

What would it compile to?
VTS isn't a programming language
didnt mean compile

Bundle? Yes thats how they are stored
hence the whole datamining aspect
yea thats it

It fails for everyone tho right?
So, if I go ahead and start work on a mission in PT, do you think I will be able to run on feature when 1.5 is release?  I haven't tried this before and I'm not sure the likelihood of an irreparable incompatibility.
It should be compatible

Unless baha radically changes something in an upcomming patch

does anyone have an estimate for how far away the next release is?
nooooooooooope
could be weeks, could be months

was there any leaks or hints about the heli before it released?
Yes, tons
there probably aint a new vehicle then

i was editing the .vts file for my mission and was wondering whether its possible to duplicate sequence events. Im assuming all i would need to change is the id of the event so there is no conflict am i right?
Because when i attempted this they dont show up in my sequence events list in the editor. Im assuming its because i havent changed the id of the conditional?
Duplicating entire event sequences? Or just sequence nodes?

Did you completely quit VTOL and restart?
It doesn't load changes from disk until you exit the game
ill do that

How else will people read the briefing?
too true
You convinced me

It plays video sounds too?
holy fuck thats cool
You have to pair it with a play priority message or equivalent, as seen in the screenshot

Did you place all of them manually and edit in the config?
That must take alot of dedication
Yo that's awesome. Definitely using that 👍

Is it possible to setup a mission where players start on the carrier but then when they die they start in the air?
Yes. Use the `Move Spawn` trigger action
Is it possible to change the team of enemy units? For example have an ASF-30 show up as friendly for team A on their NAV map.

No
tragic

Are there any advantages to using the VTS file to create missions outside of the ability to copy paste?
You can do some things the mission editor won't let you do
like putting buildings in weird places

How many units is too many units?
For what? Pref? Dynamic lib has 1000+ spawns with like 25% spawning
In a performance context. Like is there a recommended cap when performance starts to suffer

Depends on the type of unit and what you have it doing

If an air unit is in a group following a path and has engage enemies checked. Will it break off of the path to attack ground targets that it comes across?
Performance cost: Players > AI air > AI ground/naval > AI stationary
specifically ASF-30 against radar/sam sites

hey, if I edit my mission .vts file and change a mission critical player aircraft's lives to zero, will the logic in the game consider that unit as dead? even though it hasn't spawned yet? (this player aircraft will get lives later in the mission though. I want this aircraft to be considered alive, just unavailable until a certain point in the mission)
Always interpret the `Is Alive` condition to mean "Has not died"
 Setting a slot's initial lives to 0 simply means it cannot be used at start, until its lives are increased by triggers.
I may have misread your question, but I think I answered it

How do you convert standalone missions to campaigns?
To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign. 2. Import your mission into that campaign via the campaign editor. 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer via the campaign editor.
how do i make ai land in editor

Curious... Perhaps the dollar sign?
Nah, it seems to empty every time so I hadn't hit save. I thought "if it uploaded first time it would upload every time" but not. then forgot to hit save after filling it in again... stupid me
1 last thing, no matter what i do the stupid budget for B team keeps re setting

did you move this from single player to multiplayer?
ie to campaign?
maybe, took me  awhile to figure out how to even make an mp game

is there a  and B budget line i can add?
ok, what you need to do is make a new campaign and mission, then compare all of the lines to that of your current one to make sure youre not missing any variables
i had to do it with my project, it takes about 20 mins

why do you want them to have a budget anyway?
stop spamram, making a comp 3v3 mission
hm

AIRS-T are disabled as well then?
yeah i cant think of an immediate fix
If your goal is to make a comp mission, limiting budget will mean good players never kill each other with AIM-120s

I've got a KC49 that I'm trying to have land at an enemy airbase. it spawns quite a ways away, then just orbits in place in stead of trying to fly over and land. do I need to get it closer before telling it to land or is there something up with the kc49 landing at enemy airbases?
Did you order it to land using a trigger action?
yes

Did you order it to land using a trigger action?
yes
Does that trigger fire immediately when the mission starts or when the KC49 spawns in? If so, you should change it to have a couple seconds delay.

Does that trigger fire immediately when the mission starts or when the KC49 spawns in? If so, you should change it to have a couple seconds delay.
the trigger action for landing had a 3 second delay after the aircraft spawned in. but the aircraft is like ~50nmi from the airbase
Also, is it a Team B KC49? (Does that unit even exist?)

Also, is it a Team B KC49? (Does that unit even exist?)
it's a team A kc49 trying to land on a team b airbase, there is no kc49 on team b
Oh, AI aircraft will never land on an enemy airbase. (Probably because ATC will never give it clearance.) You could temporarily switch the allegiance of the airbase, but that might mess with other aircraft.

any way to spawn an ai av42 that's already loaded up with guys on a cruiser though?
if not that's not a big deal, i can still work around it
Pretty sure you can spawn in an AI AV-42 full of infantry. There's an extra button in the AI AV-42 unit properties dialog for it. Never used it myself, and I wouldn't be surprised if putting it on a carrier breaks that.

Anyone know why sometimes images I put onto my senarios refuse to update? "No image"
cant get this bad boy to change to "saved"
I was able to fix it by editing the xml manually. weird

is there a way to detect how many players are online?   I want to spawn AI wingmen when there are too few players online, and despawn them if more players join
Currently there isn't a way to check how many players are in the game exactly
The best you can do is check how many player planes are alive with a looping event, and spawn AI aircraft if it's below a threshold

is there a way to "reset" an objective so it can be done again?
No
Well, you could cancel it instead of completing

so the only way to cancel an objective is through an event?
correct
nice

What's the question? And what's a "protect variable"?
how can I make it to where as long as a single unit from a list is alive you still pass?
Use a conditional objective

how can I make it to where as long as a single unit from a list is alive you still pass?
Use a conditional objective
fail condition: UnitList <units to protect> ~~is not all alive~~ num alive equals 0

is it possible to update the available weapons for a player after the game starts ? As in during a re-arming .. ?
No. But you can add slots that have 0 lives at start, and unlock them with triggers. Those slots can have more weapon options.
interesting .. ok thanks

I've got my convoy set to a path, and speed "fast" however they dont seem to move. Do they need to have a road under them or something?
Land units that are in a unit group must be ordered to move with unit group actions.
Default behavior doesn't work once they are in a group, for some reason.

and for ground targets, does railpath work better than path?
assume not or it'll clip through the ground hah
Railpath is deprecated. Don't use it

Is it normal for AI craft to follow a player even if they are not part of their flight group?  I got the mission im working up set up that one wingman will spawn per player that joins, so that every player will have one AI wingman, however when i tested the mission with a friend, the AI did not want to follow either of us until we gave the "form up" command, and when we did that, all the wingmen formed up on only one of us, regardless of flight group.
Never used AI wingmen, sorry :/
is ok. Hoping someone else can help tho

How do I make a multiplayer mission? I can't make a second player unit, so how do I go about it?
ah sorry, found the help post by the ATCBot. thank you
How do I make the player an aircraft other than the AV-24C

How do I create FARP in the mission editor?
Rearm points are a type of unit you can create
thank you!

I have a condition > Unit group:Alpha > Num Alive == 0  > AND  > TeamB kills > 0   This was true after one kill even though Alpha still had players in the air, any idea what I did wrong?
Players don't count for unit groups. Use a UnitList instead
Oh ok, thanks 👍

Does the fire ctrl radar p have the same stats as the fire ctrl radar?
I don't know which, but one of them has more transmitter power (I would assume the fcr P is the FCR2 in this graph)
Perhaps

I’d estimate like 14-18 ish based off of memory i think?
your guess is better than mine
maybe a decent way to measure performance would be deltaV

How'd you pull that off?
Iirc there's a position value in the vts you can tweak that dosn't actually move the airbase but does change where trees can/can't spawn
game updated trees in, then updated them out

problem is, they dont line up in the editor. The names of the units in the editor are MP Spawn [n], how do i tell which one is which?
should i just remove them all and add them back in in the order i want potential players to spawn
If you remove them all, you could break triggers and actions that reference Alpha group. Better to leave at least one member at all times.  They will always show up on the slot list in UnitID order you cannot change that without modifying the .vts. What you want to do is make the unit group member order match that.

What's wpn count? Does it tell you the armament of the player?
you should make a guide on all vteditor hidden functionality
Can you find the independence day UFOs in source code, and if so, can they be called by editing the .vts? Asking for a friend.

i made a map but it won't let the host get in the plane. Any idea of how I can fix that? Map is Day 2 of the Kyushu multiplayer campaign
Wow, you're right. That's a bug!
Which file did you find this in? I need to find the unitID and .vts/.vtc format to spawn a ufo fighter.

Which file did you find this in? I need to find the unitID and .vts/.vtc format to spawn a ufo fighter.
I didn't, that was Red Elite. It's only used in that workshop mission, which I assume is encrypted. You can ask Red Elite for the info, or decompile the game and search for the list of units.

Can I remedy this somehow or are you working on a bugfix for this certain issue yourself? I could try changing a few things out that I've never used before for things I know would work in their stead
Baha will likely fix it at some point, but if you want to look for a work around, it seems somehow related to ASF-30 [208], my guess its unit group/unit group actions somehow
If I had to guess, having the AI aircraft in the same group as the rocket boats fucks up something

@Tyron did you edit the VTS at some point?
Well there's the problem
I didn't edit the VTS, no. But it sometimes happens that units get mangled up in different groups, I had that happen before

What method do you usually use to assign group membership? Selecting it in the unit dialog? Mass-assignment through the unit groups list? Copying units?
Normally just single-selecting a unit and assigning it but for the ones that got mangled I had them copied from an existing configured unit
tfw you spend about 4 hours in the editor and lose everything to a power outage fml

Let's say I want jets to take off with a delay to another group taking off. Would the events look something like this? It didn't work when I checked; Kilo took off 60s after mission launch instead of waiting 60s after Bravo is airborne
Does the bravo group spawn in immediately?
yeah. They are all parked by default

Does the bravo group spawn in immediately?
yeah. They are all parked by default
Correct me if im wrong sypwn, but i believe what is happening here is that for a brief moment when you load in, the game thinks all units are airborne. Therefore, what i would do is change the delay on the first node to 10, 15 seconds. And move the entry condition from the first node to the second

the delay in the top left of each timed sequenced action refers to it being before the entry condition is met or is it after?
I believe before
i may be wrong tho

Silly question but what does the "training mission" checkbox do when creating a mission?
I dont actually know, i think it disables quick saves for singleplayer missions
I feel that Euler has screwed me over here.

Just testing using slanted platforms as a "skirt" around a large raised platform.

How do I make a path that infinitely loops around a given path? Does the loop function do that automatically? And what is a Rail Path vs the normal Path a unit can undertake?
When constructing the path, check the "loop" box.  Rail Path is deprecated. Do not use it. Just use Path
that makes sense. My tanks didn't move, haha :D

Is it reasonable to ask this guy to not call his mission "Dynamic Combined Arms Liberation"?
ehhh
Like, I don't claim ownership of either of those words individually, but please don't use them together :/

@Sypwn so what do you reckon they'd be doing? BTW thnks for response. i seem to have Discord connectivity at present. Previously have 'unable to update Discord', then text loads but images won't (until I disable Kaspersky AV). is all a bit weird - first Oculus wouldn't connect to internet, then (a few weeks later) Skype f*cked up, now Discord!?
If you work for a three letter government agency, then they would theoretically use it to copy data from your computer and otherwise spy on you. Otherwise, they might use it for a botnet.  But it doesn't matter. Just uninstall Kaspersky. Windows Defender is good enough these days.
Also, this conversation doesn't belong in #mission_editor

Whats the best way to make a group of aicraft take off and attack a certain target? set them to take off and in the same trigger add priority targets?
like that?
`Attack Target` and `Set Designated Targets` should both work, engaging the target regardless of distance. `Set Priority Targets` only works if the target enters their engagement range.

will it both work in the same event or do i have to wait with the target designation until they all took off?
`Set Designated Targets` can be set anytime as long as they are alive. They will engage when able. `Attack Target` I'm not sure about
attack target im pretty sure just makes them instantly know where their target is and disregard everything else till they knock it out

does unit that is not yet spawned count as dead if it is in a unit list thats set to trigger if "not all alive"?
if it's waiting to spawn it is not dead
Consider alive to mean "has not died yet"

I can't get ground tanks to follow the path I have set up. Any guides? They should follow at spawn but they dont move
Are they in a group?
A unit group, like Alpha or Charlie

Are they in a group?
A unit group, like Alpha or Charlie
Yes but I want them to travel individually

Could I make them not part of a group but share a path?
Or make individual paths
Yes, but you'd have to issue each individual unit separate movement actions (or only stick with default behavior)

So the only thing I'm missing is that theyre in a group?
Its not too fancy
Yeah. If you ungroup them, place one in each corner of the square path, and set their default behavior to path (with that square path selected), then I think they will do what you want.

will a required objective with no success condition keep the mssion from being completed? a.i., "protect carrier" fail= carrier destroyed, success= none
Yes, because objectives can be set completed by separate trigger actions.
ok

whats the best way to trigger it complete once all other objectives are complete?
Have a GV that increments by 1 when each other objective completes, and when it reaches the right number than that last objective completes.
thats gonna be fun. never used global values

have you ever programmed anything? GVs are just integer variables
nope
Ok then, it's just a number stored and tracked by the game. You can set the initial value, you can change it with actions, and you can check it with conditions.

this menu? dont see it here. im guessing somewhere else
System
ah

and just do that for every objective and then set the protect carrier to be completed once [number of objectives] is reached?
yes
Or alternatively, you could have an objective that fires using "Prereqs". So it only fires once all the objectives before it are complete

also, what do you guys think of having to drop off ground crew at an airbase to use it for refueling? i always thought its kinda weird that we bomb a place to pieces and sudddenly the ground crew materialzes and is  telling you theyre ready
good idea
now i wish we could place and keep infantry on moving carriers. for now i have to make up some story of how they managaed to swim to an island near the AO the day before lol

if i go into the map the mission is using and change something, will it just accept it on the mission folder as well?
That's what the `Tools -> Repack Map` button does. Update the mission with the latest version of the custom map.
So you change it in the map editor, then go into the mission editor and repack.

okay, save and quit mission editor, open map editor, fix it, open mission editor, repack?
exactly
The reason the road cuts off is because it's technically a bridge at that point. You need to delete that last road segment, then add two short segments at the end that are both grounded to fully convert it to grounded road.

Not in formation, no. You can kinda fake column by making them split up and follow the same path independently, but the ships have different top speeds and won't stick together. https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/962116934730678332/1023827513153175582

what are the capabilities of the rocket boat? are they unguided rockets, heat seeking, do they act like artillery?
Unguided. The can engage other naval targets, or ground targets near the shore. They do a significant amount of damage though.

unrelated, whats the max range of the opfor artillery guns/ the trucks?

"if p1 is near p2 or p3 or p4 or p5 or p4= destroy p1" wont work?
Make event trigger with a unit list, then use a `Conditional Action` to determine which units collided and blow them up
there would have to be one trigger event for each possible collision, no?

there would have to be one trigger event for each possible collision, no?
Although I'm not sure if blowing one of the players up will make impossible to detect which other player involved.
with 6 players on each team that 36 events

what is the unit for initial and nav airspeed in the mission editor?
is it knots or m/s
m/s. everything in the editor is meters

is theplayer count how many mp spawns there are?
fuck it im doing it
at this point it would probably be worth your time to write a script to do it for you

i just realized, this will only work if one team is only hunting and one only being hunted. cus, how are you going to determine who earned the kill?
alright, i have a setup that might work. 4 players each team. 2 hunters, 2 hunted. hunter is F-45 with no equips, hunted is F-26 with a gun.
NEVERMIND players cannot be killed using events???

NEVERMIND players cannot be killed using events???
They can on 1.5, which is also required because you'd need looping triggers to make them activate every time
oh

@Tj4y I'm hosting a lobby to test this on the public_testing branch. Join me?
gimme 5 min
can confirm, the 1.5 update is a key part to my mission lol

Anybody know if it is possible to spawn a multiplayer spawn AV42 with troops inside? Or to give players the choice of what jet to spawn?
> Anybody know if it is possible to spawn a multiplayer spawn AV42 with troops inside Its not, only in SP. In MP you have to spawn the troops nearby and tell them to load in  >  players the choice of what jet to spawn You can do this by placing a bunch of mp spawns and letting the player choose which slot they want
Fair enough, thank you.

Still no spawning infantry on boats, right?
yes. You can place infantry on a non moving carrier/cruiser or drop them off there with a AV, but as soon as the ship moves they will be left floating
anyone know how to slow down the mq-31 refueling drone when it's in an orbit? it loves to go about mach 1.09 which makes refueling all the more tricky.

Supersonic air to air refueling lmao
I just set a rectangle path instead, that allows for setting speed, as well as getting the drone to fly straight for good distances, hopefully this will work.

Question about briefings ; is there something in the editor I need to select for a mission to be able to use the nice big defcon room looking breifing room?
The choice of the briefing room is up to the person hosting the mission
It is also restricted by the number of player slots; missions with a lot of slots will only be able to use the combined large room with bleachers

is there a way to change the units?
?
in the editor

you mean change one unit to a different type without deleting it?
measurement units
no like mps to knts

whats the max amount of players in one lobby again? 16 or 18?
16
sweet, cheers 👍

StarRazor — Today at 9:29 PM can anybody tell me why I don't get notifications in game for new objectives? for my campaign at least? doesnt work in testing
got a vague concept/idea for a mission the other day while playing cyberpunk. had the idea of basically making a trauma team mission where you fly the AV-42 around doing medi-vacs. missions would be varying from simple grab and goes to hot LZ's and some sort of idle patrol. anyone got any good ideas for objectives/tasks? imagining just using the training map for it but any other suggestions ill be open to.
Is your HUD/HMCS off at the time?

I'm catching up on repeatable actions in mission editor. Can someone pls give me a short description of repeating actions/events. How does it work? How do you configure to get an event/action to fire again.  Pls
Switch to the public_testing branch of VTOL. Looping triggers were only just added in 1.5.0 Create an event sequence. Check the "While" box. Leave the while condition as "true"
Give your sequence's first node an entry condition of when you want it to fire.
Of course your mission won't be playable by the general public until 1.5.0 gets pushed to stable, which could be quite a while at this point.

how do I make objectives optional?
Uncheck the "Required" box in the objective properties
The mission ends in success when all Required objectives are completed, or ends in failure if any Required objectives are failed.

Any way to re-order the objectives? Dragging them around in the objectives menu doesnt seem to do anything. They stay in the order they were created
Activate them in a specific order
(But late joiners will always see them in the order you initially created them)

How do paths work for ground units? I'm assuming they stick to the ground regardless of the height of the path node
iv been haveing an issue where the name and decription of my campain will not save. anyone know whats going on and how to fix it?
AFAIK, yes. Although I haven't tried telling ground units to follow path nodes far in the air...

After playing the mission, search your player.log for the name/id of that AWACS. If something is preventing it from spawning, it should show up there.

Need help. Making MP mission on custom made map. Set default path to a given path. Another aircraft default orbit to a given way point to orbit.   Set to takeoff ready so they’re engines hot. Load in to test. Fly over and the enemy aircrafts have not moved an inch. What am I doing wrong? Spent ages fiddling and nothing!   I haven’t tried placing them airborne as I want the enemy planes to take off as we do.
Set their default behavior to takeoff, not path
Once they takeoff and complete this given command, do they the default to their next command entry? Ether path or orbit?    Also without any given command after take off, what is their default behaviour?

Once they takeoff and complete this given command, do they the default to their next command entry? Ether path or orbit?    Also without any given command after take off, what is their default behaviour?
If they have a default path assigned, they will start pathing it after takeoff
….. I am so upset I didn’t think of this. Genuinely been shouting at myself for the last 2 hours. Sypwn thank you! I will load up tomorrow and set their values correctly.

does this campaign have any other missions in it, besides teh one we're looking at?
it’s one mission and a lot of targets
???

or more options to displaying hints /text than there currently are... is it possible to set these infinitely instead of having them disappear after 1-99999s?
Make it an objective
I wouldn't want popup text blocking my view for an entire mission

hi, i am trying to write a sequence to make an ai AV-42 do a pickup mission (mostly just for fun) but for some reason whenever it tries to take off after the pickup it immediately flips forwards and ends up on the ground on its back, any ideas what is going wrong?
Nap time : ]
well it is 11:30pm for me so almost

Does it follow a path?
no, just take off
with a delay 3 second delay for the next action (RTB)

What happens if you don't have the land at waypoint action?
And does the kestrel flip over immediately after taking off?
lets see

And does the kestrel flip over immediately after taking off?
lets see
yes, will film it this time

how do i report bugs?
make a post in #vtolvr-bugs
ok

How did you get that view in the editor?
good point, it is landing under full AA and missile fire
push insert to get debug camera

Does anyone know why my MP map has 12 player slots but will only let 8 people join a team and the rest get stuck on the team select screen?
that's the limit
theres a slider in the menu with which you can limit the amount of players, the people that can spawn in are limited by the number of player aircraft

are there more than 8 aircraft slots?
there is like 30 player spawn
it just started happening not long ago but before i could have 12 in the lobby

does the briefing room have enough seats?
idk
yeah its the large room with the 2 rows of chairs on both sides like every other mission

Could you put a road there that goes uphill slightly to stop it from flipping forward?
not easily. Im using the default island map. Not up to making my own
I can try and set the waypoint so that it is taking off from one of the existing roads

Is there any tutorial guides for making automatically spawning AI? I want to make AI automatically respawn/fresh spawn in and follow default route/orbit, AFTER certain AI planes/patrols have been destroyed. I think it uses the logic panel but I’ve no idea how it what to use.
only in public testing right now
looping event sequences and respawnable units is what you are looking for

Either that or delay AI from following take off sequence.    Or can I for example, place in editor but NOT spawned in. So the event can be, if unit Bravo is not present they spawn in?
yes. you can check the "respawnable" box on units to make them respawnable. You can already place units but uncheck "spawn immediately" and they won't spawn until you make them
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/1037631734356918312

So with this. In THEORY. I could have many many units at a secondary airfield spawn in under an event action. Such as Bravo Unit being killed? So on so forth
You just can't have killed units respawn
Yes. This is how Dynamic Liberation reinforcements currently work. Many many copies of the same units.

So I can, have BRAVO unit spawn once ALPHA is destroyed.   Then CHARLIE unit spawn once BRAVO is destroyed and so on. That would be how to do it, correct?   With entering commands. I would leave default behaviour as take off and default path to the path I want them to fly and the newly spawned in unit will follow these like normal?
Yes, exactly
Put all that in a single Event Sequence.

How do I do this? I had a brief look but it intimidated me. Tried Google but direct video to explain it
Nevermind lol already said it
Not near a computer right now or I would send you a screenshot

hello fellas, ive been working on a map which is intended to be open world with the random encounters mod.   I have an AWACS and tanker setup to be flying around the friendly area of the map and they both have different paths set, but no matter what ive tried, they both stick to the same path and orbit right next to each other (which makes refuelling unnecessarily difficult). does anyone know what the issue could be?
you need them to be in different groups, otherwise they will try and form up together
didnt think of that :o

do the event sequences delay timers start right away or do they only start once entry conditions are met?
I would think the timer starts first then does the entry check once the timer runs out right?
Delay -> Entry condition -> Action -> Exit condition

I would think the timer starts first then does the entry check once the timer runs out right?
Delay -> Entry condition -> Action -> Exit condition
If you want a delay **after **a condition is met, then you need to put that condition in the exit condition of the previous node

Dumb question but i wanted to be sure when you upload a map to the steam workshop do you update it the same way? By uploading the same missions just new ones
> Dumb question but i wanted to be sure when you upload a map to the steam workshop do you update it the same way? Yes  > By uploading the same missions just new ones What?
Ah sorry about that me being bad at English

But thanks

so how does a sequence work with nodes vs actions?
👆
each component is optional

so why would a taxi action be getting skipped?
Nothing is skipped
ok, why would it be taking off wihtout taxiing?

ok, why would it be taking off wihtout taxiing?
what's "it"?
an AI av42

is there a way to force it to?
dunno
never tried

there are no time stamps, it this oldest first or newest first?
oldest at the top
search for the name of the unit, or the name of the sequence node

is there a way to make infantry act normal when under fire not just stand there?
Are they set to engage enemies? Are there nearby enemies they can shoot at?
yes and yes but they just stand there

Are they set to engage enemies? Are there nearby enemies they can shoot at?
yes and yes but they just stand there
They won't take cover or nothing, but they should be shooting

will tanks with engage set but stop to engage unset shoot while moving?
yes
cool

anyone know if the gav-25 has a twr limit for vertical takeoff?
I believe the TWR requited for all VTOL AI is 1.1
thanks. thats why they haven't been taking off then.

Can anyone confirm for spawning in enemies.  Alpha unit. spawn immediately. Bravo, DO NOT spawn immediately.  Event as follows, entry condition: Alpha number alive 0=output.  Exit condition: Bravo All Alive=Output.  Doing this will spawn in Bravo units once ALL Alpha units are dead, Correct?
Your entry condition is correct, but your exit condition makes no sense. You'll want to use an action to spawn bravo, not a condition
So, Remove conidiont and add action

That will then spawn in Bravo under the condition Alpha are all dead?
Yes
Once again Sypwn you have saved A LOT of swearing 🙂 appreciate it all!

Question is, any idea why the rest of the server doesn't hear the audio?
most likely this logic only runs on the host, and the sound isn't synchronised
do not quote me on this, am not multiplayer mission maker

Me again.   So I have two enemy airfields that are set to become ours once we destroy X amount of enemies for repairs and re-arm...  How will I stop the newly placed spawn-in enemies from spawning there once we take control of alpha and bravo base?
use a Global Value
or, stop the reinforcement sequence when the airbase is captured

Can you link a "how to" guide on that?
there are no guides
Because simply put, ive copied the units changed names and set them to spawn when their counter part units all die and follow the set commands, take off/default path etc

and it's all handled in one large Event Sequence, right?
have a global variable like: "Basecaptured" set to 0, and set it to 1 after its captured. Global variables are in the same category as scenario info i believe
you can use global variables in conditions

So in objectives, under completed event, New action Alpha respawn=Stop sequence. and this stops ALL event sequence of the preset I have for respawn?
So sorry I'm not the best at explaining
> So in objectives, under completed event, New action Alpha respawn=Stop sequence Yes  > this stops ALL event sequence of the preset I have for respawn? As far as I understand, yes

> So in objectives, under completed event, New action Alpha respawn=Stop sequence Yes  > this stops ALL event sequence of the preset I have for respawn? As far as I understand, yes
then post screenshots instead of text explainations
everyone loves screenshots

what does the follow behavure do on grounfd units?
not sure
oof

oh, and another thing I am curious about with the current pub test. Lets say you have a large enemy group and half of them have been killed. If you have the entire group force respawned by an event, does it just respawn the dead units, or does the *entire* unit list/group get respawned in it's entirety? (creating even more units than were originally spawned.)
only units that are dead will be respawned
noice

Will this work on multiplayer too?
Only for ai iirc
Hmmm

i cant get this convoy to move on the rail path for the life of me lol any ideas why they wont budge?
iirc railpath is a discountined feature, just use regular path mode
sorry i made a path I've set them to follow the path and there fucking stood there

yea then not sure, take a look through your logic and if you dont notice anything send an image i guess?
fuck it im off to bed haha will try tomorrow
thank you dude!

is there any simple way to modify the default missions? say for example I wanted to play some of the F26 campaign as an F45, some of the F45 quick missions as an AV-42, etc
Yes but requires some work/extracting the game
Not quite "simple". You have to extract the asset files with AssetRipper, then convert them to .vts files.

How do alt spawns work so i want the helio to spawn on a fob base after we take it do i have to put another spawn on the position?
Don't use alt-spawns for that. Use the "Move Spawn" action
Alt-spawns are primarily for randomizing the position of AI units

do flying units always have to take off in order to be airborne or can i spawn them in the air?
i tried to spawn them in the air and set a path but they never got there
did you give them fuel and an initial speed?

did you give them fuel and an initial speed?
yes you can spawn aircraft in the air
this is my convoy atm... they wont budge

were do i make these actions?
thank you
like this?

awesome so they should move now?
if i want to make this convoy bigger now can i just copy the units?
will they all take the same action

if i want to make this convoy bigger now can i just copy the units?
will they all take the same action
Yeah, as long as they are in alpha group

well i give this ago and if i get stuck again can i give u a shout?
thanks so much for helpinf dude! im such a boomer when it comes to this shit haha
Just ask your questions here in this channel.

Hey everyone!  Looking for a bit of help.   If i create a path like this, is there a way I can trigger it to be set as a route on the nav screen?
I.E by hitting a waypoint trigger
I'm not sure, if I want to create a "route" I'll just normally use a load of waypoints which I then connect to objectives which only activate once the previous objectives are complete

Me again...  So, after we take say, Alpha base and it becomes friendly ally base. How can I set this as a new respawn instead of the initial FOB airfield?
use the Move Spawn trigger action
you can put it in the complete actions of the objective to capture the airbase

Can I not move spawn for Unitgroup? I assume I will need to add MP spawn to that location or does it make me place new spawn after the event trigger
> Can I not move spawn for Unitgroup? No. That would move the entire unitgroup into one spot, so everyone would spawn inside each other, lol. You'll want people to spawn in different hangers or helipads or whatever.  > I assume I will need to add MP spawn to that location No. The Move Spawn trigger makes you set a new location through the trigger
To the left of UI.. Thats the new spawn?

yeah

Does the headig not follow your orange radar thing on the editor with the arrow for facing direction?
what orange radar thing?
That

Sweet jesus. Okay next one. How to reference curser heading, is it in 360 compass value? For example 0 is north 180 south etc?
because the Move Spawn action was quickly added in 5 minutes in response to AH-94s being otherwise unplayable in Dynamic Liberation
Yes. You can see the current cursor heading at the bottom of the screen.

is there a way to change player spawn points? or is that just for AI
Scroll up. That's the conversation I just had with Ducky
awkward. thanks

For a cleaner lobby look and story line  is it not possible to do it the way I mentioned then?
If it works it works I’m happy! Just tidiness of story line and lobby appearance that’s all
I'm not sure

Help. I just deleted a custom campaign I have been working on. It wasn't uploaded to steam yet. Any ideas if I can retrieve it somehow?
do you have any back-ups? like file history?
I'm just trying a system restore to see if I can see the campaign folder is back before I open up vtol again

Enable limited lives for that helicopter slot. Go into the .vts and change the initial lives to 0. To unlock the slot, grant it 99 lives or whatever with a trigger.

I am trying to access the debug camera, but when I press the insert key nothing happens. Can someone help me?
You need to make a pilot named "devcam" and use that when you test the mission. Also try pressing shift-insert. Sometimes only that works for some reason.
IIRC devcam is only necessary in mp

That worked, thanks a lot! Also, is there a way to skip the team selection screen, so I don't have to put on my goggles everytime?
Only by converting the mission back to singleplayer.
I created Dyn Lib initially as a singleplayer mission, then converted it to MP once all the mission logic was done and tested. The ability to remotely kill units and fast-forward in the devcam are also exclusive to singleplayer missions and super useful.

Okay, how can I convert a MP mission to a SP one?
Create a SP mission and add one player spawn. Create an MP mission and add one player spawn. Open both .vts files in Notepad++ or equivalent and study the differences.
I used AI aircraft to represent the other players while I was working on the mission, then manually converted them back to MP slots when I converted the rest of the mission. That way I could program in all the triggers that reference them.

SO. to set a Bravo base to spawn in nonespawned AI AFTER Alpha base has been taken.. do I just begin event sequence bravo base start with ONLY a new action " Spawn XXX unit "?
objective finish events
event sequence to begin after alpha base is taken

So the secondary photo is fine? it will begin event seuqence and follow the action " spawn XXX unit "
and then any spawn unit sequence after will active once XXX unit is dead
If all you're doing is spawning those units immediately, you can cut out the sequence entirely and spawn them directly from the objective complete action from the previous base

So having both an event sequence AND obj complete action to spawn, will not cause any problems?
What you have in the pictures will work fine
Thanks ❤️

Hey, I'm making an absolutely amazing rescue mission. How do I get the infantrymen to get into the airplane when they land?
Is the AV-42 a player or is it AI?
they will end up being AI. It's for multiplayer.

Is the AV-42 a player or is it AI?
they will end up being AI. It's for multiplayer.
You have to use an event action to tell the AI to pick them up.  You may first have to tell them to land nearby. I haven't used pickups myself yet. @ISEGaming may know more.

Having both the ship and jets set to spawn in with either objective finish or even sequence, this will work like an airbase correct?
Yes. Although you may want to delay the spawning of the aircraft for a second after the carrier spawns. Otherwise there is a race condition where the aircraft sometimes won't spawn.
How do I delay? I assume thats in the event sequence for "spawn unit group "?

How do I delay? I assume thats in the event sequence for "spawn unit group "?
Split it into two nodes in the sequence. First node spawns the carrier (and other ships) with no delay. Second node spawns the aircraft, but set the delay to 0.1
Like so?

First carrier spawns and jets 0.01 after.. once first jets are numberalive=0 carrier 2 and secondary jets spawn in. That is correct I believe?
I've added 0.01 to second jets to prevent issues
Wait, so the second carrier just pops in once you kill the first set of aircraft??  Why not make them all spawn in with the planes parked, and have the second set take off when the first are destroyed?

Or wait for 1.5 when you can respawn units
Trying to keep performance up which is why I went that route. Which would be better?

Trying to keep performance up which is why I went that route. Which would be better?
they have roughly 15nm to cover before they get to where friendly will be
Stationary units don't use much performance

Okay! I will give it a whirl! But for future big big missions, what I had was correct for it to work?
Appreciate it!
For future big big missions, use 1.5 unit respawning as much as possible

*reads* looks like you guys explained the whole Player AV-42 picking up Soliders to @udjason?
_me again_  If I place ASF30's on the same flight path as an enemy AWACS.. will they convoy or will they fly off and leave the AWACS?
what is the range of the mpa155

_me again_  If I place ASF30's on the same flight path as an enemy AWACS.. will they convoy or will they fly off and leave the AWACS?
what is the range of the mpa155
~26km on flat terrain

question, does the mission editor have a trigger for hitting a specific waypoint with a weapon of any kind?
nope
you could simulate it probably

whta is the firerate of the mpa155?
uhh
It's fairly quick

isnt a salvo a shot?
No
i want to know the how long it takes for the pice to shoot and then shoot agian

if i set a desingnated target to a group will a mpa155 attack that target?
Yes
same with priority?

will it stack the bodies of the targets?
I read too quick sometimes
i read quick all thre time

If you set it to attack a group?
no if the arty pice in in a grou and i give it a priority target as a group
Yes the whole group will fire

Will they return to formation if they destroy enemies? I want them to convoy and protect the AWACS
Yeah
Sorry, the AWACS is enemy AWACS, being escorted by X3 ASF-30's

Can I set Enemy Sam Radar to respawn after being destroyed? Or do I need to set up alternative radars to "spawn in" after the primary radar is downed?
Don't think it will work for new actions "spawn unit" after it is destroyed
In VTOL 1.5.0 yes. I'm the current stable version no

Does anyone know of a way to create a timer that increments every second without using the 1.5 features?
using 1.5 features is a way
I will show myself out

Only using a timed event or sequence with 1s delay. For what purpose do you want this?
i was going to create a timer that counted down from 10 minutes, but i realised i could just use a 10 min delay for timed trigger
I was going to ask, why do you need one second increments?

I was going to ask, why do you need one second increments?
But it sounds like you have it figured out
I dont, but now im curious if its possible without the looping triggers

may do in the future?
HS will probably never support triggers or AI, because of how complicated the code is for that.
Does chase have to write it himself?

Does chase have to write it himself?
yeah
makes sense

I think ive already suggested this, but how cool would it be to have an AI in the HS that uses machine learning to get better at beating people?
I would have to entirely write the AI and the physics
For PvP, most of the data is just players updating each other on who is where and who is doing what. HS simply forwards that data between the players. It doesn't even know the full state of the game.  Triggers and AI are both processed exclusively by the host, then the result is sent to the other clients. The other clients don't help with it at all, so HS would have to do that. Chase can't just steal all that code from VTOL, so he'd have to write it from scratch.

I'm trying to add a capture base to my campaign but I'm not sure how to go about it. Is it under BASE, Targets and then set team? It's a little confusing as to what constitutes taking a base.
That's how you set the initial team. You can change the base's faction as part of on objective's Completion Action
where might i find that in this menu?

where might i find that in this menu?
That's it, you got it
Sorry, I thought you were asking about the Base's tab on the right side of the editor

how does the weight in alternate spawns work, is it a percentage chance?
because if i leave them all at 100 if always chooses the first available spawn
if they all have a weight of 100, then there is an equal chance of rolling any of them

does sync group affect anything?
because i seem to be alwasy spawning in the same place
IIRC is object A has a weight 1 and object B has a weight of 3, the object A has a 25% chance of spawning

How would one properly tell an AI AV42 to land, pickup soldiers, and then take off again?
also what is the difference between Land at Wpt w/ direction and Land at Wpt w/ dir facing?
Land at wpt is just land at this spot. land at wpt w/ dir is land at this spot and when you land you need to be facing x direction

also what is the difference between Land at Wpt w/ direction and Land at Wpt w/ dir facing?
Land at wpt is just land at this spot. land at wpt w/ dir is land at this spot and when you land you need to be facing x direction
Do alt spawns work in mp spawn class?

Do alt spawns work in mp spawn class?
I think so, but they're only rolled once at the start of the mission.
You need looping triggers to properly randomize player spawns.

are looping triggers possible now?
In the 1.5.0 PTB
how do I make an alt spawn weight 0?

how do I make an alt spawn weight 0?
I want to make checkpoints so players that die dont get left behind
Do I just make it 1, hope they spawn in the right spot, and then force the spawn once they've reached the checkpoint?

Do I just make it 1, hope they spawn in the right spot, and then force the spawn once they've reached the checkpoint?
just use the move spawn action?
thats a thing?

just use the move spawn action?
thats a thing?
oh

in objectives what is per kill reward?
there is no points in vtol
and also what is full completion bonus??

and also what is full completion bonus??
ayyy
or is it just kills counted to the players stats?

or is it just kills counted to the players stats?
Those rewards are all about ingame $$, only really useful in singleplayer campaigns.
ahh

Can you get to the mission editor without a headset on hand?
Yes there are buttons on screen when you first launch the game
Yes

are there people who make missions for people? i acc suck at it terribly
Not really. But if you detail what you're looking for, and the idea is appealing, you might just inspire someone to make it.
what is this

how do i get pre planned GPS points?
There's an event action under System -> System. I think it's called "Send waypoint to GPS"
okay cool thank you

What kinder mission you after?
WAIT. So I don’t need to add rearm stations to the hangers…? Once we capture their bases we have access to them?
Is it possible to spawn an enemy multiple times?

In 1.5 yes

In 1.5 yes
and for now?

any idea when 1.5 is coming to stable?
I guess thats up to baha
Yeah baha probably dosn't even know

can anyone tell me how to sett the aircraft im using?
So I'm guessing you're trying to get all of them to take off once one of them takes off?
Yeah that’s right. Both AV are meant to take off when any of the 4 player vehicles take off

Pinned a message.

Sorry, So now that the AVs take off loaded with troops the next event is land at WPT                 but it seems like the AVs are just orbiting a waypoint which is the last event in my sequence?

An airborne AI's default behavior if it has no other active orders is to orbit its "Default orbit point" if one is set in its unit properties, or orbit its spawn point if not. Could this be what's happening?  As for why it has no other active orders, check your player.log. Not only is the firing of each event sequence node logged, but issues with AI orders are often logged there as well.

To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

is this how the sequence is meant to work? do i need to add entry/exit conditions too all the nodes to properly time the events?
Oh yeah, actions in VTOL are never blocking.
If a sequence needs to wait for something, there needs to be an entry/exit condition

Im having trouble making ai f45s engage enemy players. They have weapons and are set to engage. Is there something im missing?
Fuel?
were it so easy

Can they still detect them without it?
No if you have them with radar off they won’t engage with fox-3s. They will shoot fox-2s when they get super close
Does tis apply for enemy AI, set radar OFF and they won’t use fox 3?

Does tis apply for enemy AI, set radar OFF and they won’t use fox 3?
Even if they’re armed with fox 3’s.
Correct

I am trying to make it so that a MAD-4 radar and launcher truck moves after it launches a missile. What would be the best way to create this behavior?
You can't detect when it launched a missile.  You may have to first tell the radar to pack up by turning off "engage enemies"
what is meant by "is detected by enemy team"?

what is meant by "is detected by enemy team"?
does that count rwr detection from a player or is that only when it shows up on nav map?
Not for RWR

does that count rwr detection from a player or is that only when it shows up on nav map?
Not for RWR
(replied to wrong comment)

While I have you here do you mind talking with me about how the vehicle control events work?
I notice that you can use conditional triggers to detect when certain switches and such are interacted with in the cockpit
I actually have to go now, sorry

When I complete objective it starts objective B.  Under the start it will begin Event Sequence as shown. This will work correct? I dont need entry or exit conditions.  It is a naval carrier and x10 jets. Jets are on a 0.01S delay as suggested beforehand
Had an issue with spawn enemies so simplifying step by step to make sure it works
yeah

_Ignore location_  Once spawned onto carrier, they will automatically take off and follow given path, correct?  My understanding is,  this will work.
they should
Can I run two nodes in an event sequence, using the same entry condition " Unit A num alive=0 "

you mean in 1.5? in VTOL 1.4, unspawned units are always considered alive, so repeating an alive check like that is pointless
It's for separate nodes to spawn carrier and then jets in 1.4
what's the point to adding that condition to the second entry condition?

what's the point to adding that condition to the second entry condition?
I assume if I want the node to activate I need an entry condition
Or will it activate from top and begin going downwards once node 1 entry conditions are met, therefor making node 2 entry condition pointless/not needed?

Or will it activate from top and begin going downwards once node 1 entry conditions are met, therefor making node 2 entry condition pointless/not needed?
no
delay is optional entry condition is optional actions are optional exit condition is optional

Can I restrict weapons at different airfields? I want to make an aircraft that can't spawn with any weapons and has to go somewhere to get them
Yeah, but the player will have to manually switch between planes in the lobby
You can do that by limiting the amount of lives a spawn has

_is_ there a way I can make myself invincible in MP lobbies I host.  As I make and test missions among my friends I wanna be able to fly about freely and see what is taking off and what unbits spawn in etc.. so is there a way I can make myself invincible so I can monitor and watch how the mission develops?
I don't think you can in the editor
You may be able to in .vts

Why do you need to be flying around, why don't you just use insert camera?
What's insert camera?
devcam

I thought you had to name yourself "devcam" as well?
yes
Oh ok

Are you going to run the HS and the BFM thingy on the same lobby or 2 different ones?
HC?
Headless client

Can you not have this conversation here?

is there anything other than the static crashed av42c that emits black smoke?
I built a PvP Strike Mission for AH-94 anyone wanna help me playtest and figure out bugs and test functionality before I release?
can you make a black flare?

LOL

how to you spawn a flare?
LOL
it's a trigger action, I think under System -> System

that cannot be much to ask for?
you can probably hide the crashed av42 under the ground to just get the smoke
I hide them under trees and put them on top of ATC towers to make them look like a blown up S?A

I hide them under trees and put them on top of ATC towers to make them look like a blown up S?A
S/A
but black flare should absolutely be a thing with no light emission. I just wanna spruce up some target cities with some visual interest and make it a little more obvious where the fighting is happening

Does anyone know if you can actually record the voices for wingmen yourself in missions, or is that still limited by the selection available? Thinking about making custom voice lines for a mission; but for wingmen, as well as for the story.
not for wingmen normal interactions (evading missiles and such)
but for specific events you can use custom radio chatter

@Joshua Marston did you rename or delete the original map?
No just update it
open the VTOL game directory 1. Inside the CustomMaps folder should be a folder with the name of your custom map (`map000_firstmap`?). Inside that folder should be a .vtm file with the exact same name (`map000_firstmap.vtm`?) 2. Inside the CustomScenarios folder (and then inside the Campaigns folder if it's a campaign) should be your custom mission. Look for the mission's .vts and open it in notepad. It should say `mapID = map000_firstmap` or whatever the actual name of your custom map is.

Does anybody here know why campaign names and descriptions arnt being saved in game but are being saved on the workshop page?
There's a known bug where clicking "save" sometimes doesn't save campaign name/description changes for some reason.

Hi there, It seems we can only set a 'destroy' objective on an enemy unit. Does anyone know if it's possible to set a static object as an objective ?
use a conditional objective
hmmm ok... haven't found this yet 😇  Can you elaborate ?

hmmm ok... haven't found this yet 😇  Can you elaborate ?
oooooh I guess I'll go to sleep a bit less stupid then
thanks 🙂

is there a way to open the mission editor without having to put on a headset?
yes
Main menu bottom right@Velocity Raptor

why wont my GPS targets show up in game? i sent waypoint to GPS for each waypoint and none of them show up
this is what i have
Is that a multiplayer mission?

Is that a multiplayer mission?
The waypoints are only added to GPS for players that are alive at the time it's fired. You have it firing at 0s after mission starts. Player are still fading out from the briefing room at that time, so no one is in their vehicles to receive it.
You usually need to wait 2-3 seconds to wait for the fadeout, but even then it would fail if a player starts the mission without picking a slot.

Next question what is the max height for either the Sam Missiles or Radar?
There’s not really a max height
Generally both radars and missiles do better against high targets

Could I fake it with logic?
fake what?
Is HC live? seems like website is down

so how to setup HC?
It is not open to the public either
oh ok i see

@Sypwn, was it you who said you had a sizeable collection of dedicated servers?
I mean could you also like just have them on different ports?
and then use a proxy like nginx to forwards the different domain names to ports

I mean could you also like just have them on different ports?
and then use a proxy like nginx to forwards the different domain names to ports
For my services I do, and I have it behind nginx so I can map different domain names to internal services

Would you be breaking terms by running them simultaneously?
ahhh so the issue isnt ports but rather how many VTOL VR copies you have
yeah VM is probably the best solution to that

does HC and HS actually *rely* on the VTOL executables or is that just a restriction you made for copyright reasons?
Also we should go to #off-topic before Sypwn wakes up
fair

Just to confirm. If I set enemy AI with radar OFF they wont have use of Fox3's?
it seems unlikely that they can use fox3s
(Sorry got distracted yesterday) fake a max radar range or angle if possible

Hey! I'm making a mission which has a couple of hundreds of very similar objectives. The scenario then selects a random set of 9 of them. It's a pain to make all the objectives in the internal objective editor, but would be easy to copy and past in a text editor. 1. Any caveats with using an external text editor? 2. Is the vts file format actually conforming to some common file format which could be recognized and highlighted by a code editor?
The vts file format is a glorified .txt
You can use any text editor to edit it

Why don't you have these grouped into a single "6 selected" number alive check?
Honestly, its a personal choice, its better for me to understand at a glance. I do it alot in Engineering projects. Yes it would be cleaner to have 6 but ehh
Hey! Is this a bug? If I cancel a selected objective with "Cancel objective" action it stays visible on the objective screen. Pressing prev and then next on the screen removes it.

Hey! Is this a bug? If I cancel a selected objective with "Cancel objective" action it stays visible on the objective screen. Pressing prev and then next on the screen removes it.
The objective should change to a red colour on the objective screen. But a objective will only disappear if there is another objective after it.
Red color is for failed ones AFAIK.

Is there a convenient way to decouple workshop item description from in-game campaign description? I want to make a more in-depth description on Steam, but it does not make sense to have that in-game. So far the best option I can see is uploading with VTOL and manually editing the description on Steam, having the detailed one saves somewhere on GitHub.
Yeah. I just have a better description on steam
@Sypwn ok im here how do i do it

how do i make it so the round ends after a specific amount of enemies have been killed?
AI? Or players?
Players

does anyone have a spreadsheet with all the costs of attachments? just to give a feeling of how much budget to give
im sorry to ask this but how do you make a enemy team player? i cant seem to spawn a player for the enemy team
Did you create the mission as part of a multiplayer campaign?

Hi everyone, what does this option do in the editor?
It means when the objective starts, all present players have their NAV points set to the selected waypoint.
I doubt it. Maybe @Strikeeaglechase . But few people touch that feature.

i also got 2 small questions that would be a lot of help for fanciness 1. how do i give players GPS coordinates. not waypoints 2. can i make an enemy blind/dormant? there is the "engage enemies" checkbox, but i dont believe that affects cruiser radar/SAMs?
> 1. how do i give players GPS coordinates. not waypoints It's an event action under System -> System. (Send Waypoint/Path to GPS?) But know that in MP it only affects players that are spawned in and alive when it activates.  > 2. can i make an enemy blind/dormant? there is the "engage enemies" checkbox, but i dont believe that affects cruiser radar/SAMs?  Yeah I think that's a bug. I need to report it. There's also the "Set non-targets" action, but that can be just as buggy.
1. ah, okay that explains it. so i have to set up a trigger to like 5 seconds so that they get it?  2. sad. i know that for the mobile ground radars (only mad 4 i guess) it is meant to not close in on enemies while still having the radar going

> ah, okay that explains it. so i have to set up a trigger to like 5 seconds so that they get it?  Yeah. Because players are still fading out from the briefing room for the first couple seconds, and some people don't pick their slots right away.

If I want to have a take off objective with allied group conditions, will it require the entire group for a true outcome or just however many of that group is spawned in?

Group conditionals usually start with  "Any..." or "All..."

so is not alive can also mean not spawned?

Only for human players in MP, yes

Unfortunate

I seem to be having a problem with enemy ground units not following the path i set does anyone know what could be causing this?
If the units are in a group, they will form up and follow the leader ignoring any other orders given.
You have to give them group action orders, or ungroup them

so any units that I want to patrol a path cannot be in a group correct?
They can, as long as they are all following it in formation
ok thank you

okay that works then XD I think for the simplicity of it will it work if i just dont set them to any group but have each convoy unit set to follow the path?
Each approach (grouped or ungrouped) has its pros and cons. You'll just have to experiment with both and decide what you think would be best for your needs.
Ok once again thank you for your expertise I'm going to be testing the "finished product" today and would be honored if you could join me

@BahamutoD or anyone else have a TL;DR explanation of exactly how units decide where to join a looping path?
If I had uploaded a test version of the mission/campaign to steam is there anyway to update that with the final version or do I just have to re-upload each version to the workshop
I can feel the frustration radiating off this post

is there a way to move spawns?
there's a Move Spawn trigger action
il look into that, thanks

is it possible to launch the editor without launching the game/VR?
yes
how do I do that?

how do I do that?

Hey! Objectives have  "Completion reward" field. Do I assume correctly that it should add score to the team score but is just broken for now?
It adds to team (or player) budget but i dont think money currently works to limit what players can equip (might be wrong)
so... since I cannot despawn infantry, is there a way to make infantry disappear without killing them? specifically, this is for a mission I wanna make where the infantry has to go inside a building, and obviously.... they cant just be standing out there, outside the door. they actually have to go "inside" the building and not die.  so... help?

IIRC all units can just clip into a building
oh O_O I mean, that works...

i come to you again with another random question  is there any way to make an enemy plane carry an anti ship missile?
No
damn, what a shame

how "stupid" will the AI go when i set a designated target? will it only evade missiles and otherwise beeline the target? and what if i only set one of a group to do so? will the others follow them? (maybe thats a good time to ask how the AI determines wing leaders by default)
pretty much what you said
if its a formation lead aircraft, the following aircraft will go with it

and im guessing the AI just determines the "first created" as the lead? also, if the lead got a designated target, will the followers break off once you get close to them?
i think its the first assigned to the group
Group membership order is determined by the order you add the units to the group. You can see the current order here. (In this case, 12, 13, 11, 10)

hmm... that might be worth integrating into the story... and i got just the right place for them to try... whats their range?
it's complicated
oh no

WAIT i didnt have to set the waypoint/path of the entire group, just the leader this entire time then??
yeah but why would you not command the entire group
its way easier

how do i do this? i got their path set and now i want them to shoot at the carrier once they are at the final waypoint... im guessing its not "set priority target"?
For rocket boats, I think "Set priority target" is the best you can do
maybe you can place rocket arty on a carrier and it maybe wont slide off XD

do you know how many problems that would solve for me?
i am weapons to surpass metal gear
When I tried that with a carrier group they all phased into each other and followed the path single file instead of staying in formation

Now are they able to shoot?
How do you Inter developer camera I couldn’t get it to work lol
I guess my insert key is broke

@Strikeeaglechase do carriers and allied cruisers have something special that allows them to move ground units while carrying them?
yes
they have a moving platform component

don't suppose one of the other smaller enemy vessels has them?
very unlikely
idk why not, its not like its really an optimisation

boats use special net syncs right?
yes
They use the downloadData same as players iirc

Why do you care so much about the AI anyway?  Your workshop doesn't appear to have any non-test VTOL missions
what do you use all this knowledge for?
oh you know

what do you use all this knowledge for?
oh you know
*also airtraffic, random encounters, ai tweaks, ai debug*

but for what? or who? do you have a portfolio of CSA missions you've made? It's just odd to make all these tools for others when you doesn't seem to have a goal of using them yourself for something. Not trying to imply anything, I'm just really curious about your motivation.
my skillset includes writing code, my skillset does not include being good at level design
fair enough

I hear we have unit respawns now? Is this true?
in vtol 1.5, yes
you can currently access it through the public_testing branch

I've got a question. What exactly needs to be done for an objective to show up for a player? I'm trying to set an objective to reach a checkpoint, and so far have it trigger on proximity and set a new spawn location, and it works when I fly in the mission, but I don't actually see the objective pop up.
Do you get the objective in your objectives menu?

In game
I don't get it there no

Are you looking for the "new objective" popup at the top of the hud?
You should probably have the spawn movement be handled by an event rather than a trigger
like am I looking to have it pop up for the player? not necessarily, the only thing I care about is that you can see the marker on your HUD.

like am I looking to have it pop up for the player? not necessarily, the only thing I care about is that you can see the marker on your HUD.
The new objective popup only happens if the objective is created during gameplay
The Move Spawn action should be inside the Completed Event actions for the objective. No need for a separate triggered event.

OOOOOH, you mean the waypoint?
yea yea
you need to check the "Auto-set Waypoint" box in the objective

in completed event action of objective editor?
yes
right now I just have it enabling the trigger

is there a way to set specific enemy units not to be targeted without making them force undetected?
that's what I'm saying, skip the pointless extra trigger
"Set non-target" action?

so is the waypoint separate from the objective? Like do I need to still put the checkpoint in the exact spot as the objective for it to be a waypoint or will the objective be a waypoint in it's own
No, the objective waypoint is the center of the trigger
I think that's what you're asking

Are you trying to decouple the visible waypoint the player sees from the actual place they have to go? Use two different waypoints for them?
No, but they are two separate things so I was wondering if I could just skip the waypoint part
but as you've explained that's impossible

except if its a player? I think there's bugs with setting players as non-targets
Not a player
I'm curious, is there a list of planned features for 1.5 available?

Planned, no. Already implemented? See the pinned messages in #public_testing
Baha very very rarely announces any future plans.
So now I've got another question. How do I make another objective become the waypoint for the player after the previous objective has been completed? It's not as simple as enabling Auto-set Waypoint is it?

So now I've got another question. How do I make another objective become the waypoint for the player after the previous objective has been completed? It's not as simple as enabling Auto-set Waypoint is it?
As long as the objectives fire in sequence (using prerequisite objectives or such), then yes it's that simple. If multiple objectives are active at the same time, then moving waypoints between them gets complicated.
ok so if I have 2 different objectives that are set to Auto-set Waypoint, do they both show up as a waypoint or does it pick one or the other?

ok so if I have 2 different objectives that are set to Auto-set Waypoint, do they both show up as a waypoint or does it pick one or the other?
the one that was activated most recently overrides the previous one
but players can anytime open their OBJ page and click the WPT button to set their current waypoint to any objective's waypoint, even if you didn't check "Auto-set waypoint"

so how do I trigger another objective to start once the previous one finishes? it doesn't seem obvious from the available actions in objective events.
set objective 2's Start Mode: Prerequesite
then check the box for objective 1 as the prereq

Is the mission count as complete once all objectives are done?
Once all __active__ and __Required__ objectives are done, yes.
If there are no active objectives at the start of the mission, it won't finish. But if there is at least 1 completed objective and no currently active required objectives, it completes.

is it possible to clone/duplicate a mission?
File -> Save As
just spent the last 4 hours making a simple mission, really gave me an appreciation for Dynamic Liberation lmao

Any kind of pattern with what aspects you don't like?
Usually the end goal is boring
Stuff like "Clear airbase to win"

Is there a way to force units in a sea group to spawn in their formation positions?
whoops bad reply
place them in their correct formation positions?

place them in their correct formation positions?
But uh, on that topic, you could simply copy the file
they always drift and I cry

So how does formation work for a group of 6?
1 23 456  I assume
It's always a V

how, without just removing and readding?
It allows a trigger to happen *every* time an event occurs, instead of only *the first time* an event occurs.  Every time the player goes above a certain altitude, something bad happens. Every time they respawn, they are invincible for x seconds. Every time they approach a friendly convoy, it resumes moving. Every time they fly away, it stops.
The possibilities are pretty insane

Does stopping  a timed event sequence pause it or stop and restart it?
I assumed stop and restart
stopping a timed event or an event sequence makes it impossible to resume or restart

This won't be the case in 1.5?
1.5 allows an event sequence to loop back to the beginning when it hits the end, instead of stop.
But that's it. Still can't restart dead sequences

How did you do that so fast? Was this already built?
or you could do this and give the objective a success condition of hold time == 30
I already had the 1.5 editor open, but otherwise no I'm just quick with making triggers 😛

If you already had it planned out I'm sure you could do it in a minute but on the fly? maybe not quite
also I didn't actually fill in the condition trees lol
Bruh :wkek:

Has there been any hint of text-from API in the mission editor?
what?
Advanced Programmer Interface, like proper scripting with text and copy paste so I can work faster and make less mistakes than I do dragging my mouse around from checkbox to checkbox

I mean are the base .vts files just default Unity serialization of the CustomScenario class? Cuz if so, moving it all to json might not even be the best move to make, for editability and all.
I don't know. Are the default unity serialization plain text?
Just go make a new scenario and look at one, lol

I don't know. Are the default unity serialization plain text?
Just go make a new scenario and look at one, lol
To be fair I also wrote a C# version

Because that's against the TOS?
Well I wouldn’t have put it on GitHub
Only reason that vts to json exists is I needed it for HC and figured it would be useful to other ppl

eta on mission editor update is like ? this spring or sooner than that?
there is no eta on anything, lol
ah man baha just needs to make the game more expensive its like giving a bunch of people a crack addiction and then not supplying more

with a proximity trigger on it as well?
for units to spawn for the encounter
im confused on where to put the chance in the logic is what i think im asking

oh for fucks sake they dont?
that explains a lot
is there a list of broken and working shit

Also, have you played shazmode?
I havent ever had a private MP experience
idk what shazmode is

Shazmode is in this campaign: <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2793994908> Dynamic Liberation AH-94 (and AV-42) only No enemy aircraft Clearing a sector moves your spawns to the next one
yucky ucky 42
pubs hate the 42 so no worries

Fly 60 minutes, get nailed by a random hidden manpad?
The other problem with realism is that we have magic IFF and no civilian faction.
more like fly 20 minutes and get shot down if your stupid

Has baha everattempted team work previously? Or hes just not open to it
I believe he's stated that he's not interested, and doesn't enjoy it.
And I can respect that

How would that work? Baha would basically have to open source the unity project lmao
well instead of making it a skill issue, work on the process so its easier for someone to create a custom unit or aircraft
like

My biggest question is *how*? What could be done to make it easier?
You literally just described CSA
yeah CSA makes it relatively easy for ai units

Has anyone actually asked Baha about that?
We've mentioned it a bunch of times without baha saying anything
:/

How would that work with things like team score and objectives tho?
oh wait hc doesnt support objectives anyway
nvm

Anyone know why I can’t see my custom mission/campaign when hosting an mp lobby? It’s set to multiplayer, I have spawn points and can launch the mission fine within the editor. I’m subscribed on steam and it’s installed but it doesn’t show up in the campaign selector when hosting a lobby
Quit the game, verify files, try again
Ok I’ll try that out

Are there any AI cruise missiles?
Some might classify the NMSS's SuperMissile as a cruise missile. But if you're asking about a big honkin missile that you can order AI to fire at ground targets, only the AGM-89/161 and only from Team A.
Ok so a "Vampire slayer" mission in which you have to kill a bunch of incoming anti ship missiles would have to be performed from Team B it seems

Do the order of key-value pairs in the `.vt*` files matter or will it read them in any order?
I assume they aren't required to be ordered
Nah order does not matter

or do you mean you can't find it in game?
I managed to find it
Can one use the giant airbase hangars and if so how?

Can one use the giant airbase hangars and if so how?
They should automatically open when you taxi up
Can you place aircraft inside

Best vr headset for this game?!
What's your budget
1000 euro maybe

But when is it coming?! Valve deckard?!
Idk
I don’t like the index

is it possible to have an MP spawn where if no one spawns there, a bot would spawn there?
you could pull that off with triggers
place both a player spawn and AI there, check if that player "is alive", if not spawn the AI.

so I just gotta hop on open beta and my mission will still work?
Otherwise it will only work the first time and never again
yeah thats what I assumed would happen

Im saying its not gonna break anything that is already in the game? I know ill have to update the radar logic
It should be fine
where is ptu changes pinned again?

where is ptu changes pinned again?
nvm
#public_testing

another question, what does enabling engage enemies do on the AEW-50 Bulwark. Does it provide BRAAA callouts for REDFOR? or does it make the AWACS lock up targets
uhhhh, I don't imagine it would do anything
yeah confused

does it have a "Radar Enabled" property?
yes
It launches fox 3's

What happens if you give an AWACS an Attack action order?
idk what happens
Im charging headset rn and building REDFOR CAP

REDFOR AI doesnt have a FOX 1?
I think they have one you can equip
nah, i think its just the heatseeking and semiactive radar missile, i cant remember their names ever

do you know which is which?
LOL yes
you got a fun mnemonic so i can remember them or something? XD

you got a fun mnemonic so i can remember them or something? XD
yeah, SRM stands for short range missile (IR), and MRM stands for medium range missile (FOX3) although MRM could probably be renamed to MRMSAR if Baha were to add a FOX-1 for REDFOR AI
then you would have MRMAR for FOX-1

also, I know there is a way for AI to prioritize targets. Does that queue in a priority list? example: GAV-25 takes off pathing to target A. when it gets to the end of its path it triggers enable engage for the GAV to prioritize target A. Then a player is detected by the GAV-25 and that triggers another prioritize target PLAYER. Will the GAV add the player to the queue or break off from its attack to intercept a player and then return to its original strike?
If you use "Add priority target", it will add the player to its pool of priority targets it can choose from. If you use "Set priority target", it will clear the pool of priority targets, and then add the player so it goes after that.
set priority target is what I need for the player proximity trigger then?

set priority target is what I need for the player proximity trigger then?
If you want it to break off at a certain point to attack the player, then resume attacking the original target, you'll need to use an Event Sequence to order it around
and I can use Player Is Not Alive to return him to his strike targets?

and I can use Player Is Not Alive to return him to his strike targets?
yeah, but once you Set priority target it will completely forget about attacking the previous target, even if the player is dead
okok sequence it is

set priority deletes the queue of targets, add priority targets adds it to the pool of targets it will attack, what does set designated and attack target do thats different?
priority targets will be attacked when they are spotted by normal means designated targets are revealed to that AI so they don't need to be spotted, and will be attacked regardless "attack target" overrides all other orders and they will attack a single target (then revert back to previous behavior when done)
okay so I need to use designated targets and attack target orders to have GAV-25's harass AH-94 pilots

attack target reverts to previous behavior which could be designated targets? so I could cut out the looping sequence?
okay so now my issue is making it individual per player. I dont want the GAV's to set attack on all players. Just the one or two that are getting too close
can I make a node for each player that will work independently or do I have to make a sequence for each player that could interfere with the GAV flight?

can I make a node for each player that will work independently or do I have to make a sequence for each player that could interfere with the GAV flight?
clicking "respawn able" means when the unit dies it automatically respawns?
I would guess so, but I've never tested mixing them before

clicking "respawn able" means when the unit dies it automatically respawns?
I would guess so, but I've never tested mixing them before
The simplest solution is to make a sequence for each player, unfortunately. It is possible to do it single sequence with a Conditional Action, and a GV for each player, but that's probably more clicks.

is there a way to turn on collisions between aircraft? i feel like it was a thing at some point, but in my missions there are none
It is in singleplayer. But not in multiplayer
ah, thanks. thats what i was worried about

so where is the action to respawn when dead? Im having trouble finding it
Im going to loop for redundancies sake now
yeah per player seems like the most straightforward way

testers? more like testes amirite
No tester role so dosn't count
Baha plz

is Unit Group Is Any Near Waypoint broken?
😩 so many questions LOL
If the UnitGroup has players in it, yes. Use UnitList if you there are players involved.

are timed events repeatable if they are looped by a sequence?
also is there any way to have a flight take off and have it randomly pick between lets say 3 different looped paths. Once it chooses a path it runs that circuit until it detects an enemy aircraft. If it wins against the player, it returns to its circuit, if it get shot down it respawns, takes off, and the dice roll for choosing 1 of the 3 paths happens again
how the hell do you direct infantry to load into an AV-42C I think im blind

is there an issue with Player AV-42C's loading and unloading infantry or something?
could've sworn I once upon a time had an infantry group load into a vehicle all at once
idk if im just being stupid

always wondered how default behavior StayInRadius works, anyone know?
If the AV-42 are piloted by players, you have to create "Pick Up" objectives for them.
No

What do you mean exactly?
Normally you just need to complete all of a mission's required objectives
Dose completing all objectives pull up the end game panel?

Dose completing all objectives pull up the end game panel?
all objectives marked as required yes
https://discord.com/channels/319915885575798785/408290968232525868/1037861539216097430

another one from me, default behavior "takeoff" used on an aircraft does what? Do I have to build a taxi path for all AI aircraft or does the default behavior just autopath to whichever runway is closest?
they handle taxiing themselves
unless they are VTOL capable, in which case they will just take off straight up

so gav-25 requires a taxi path built if you want it to STOL?
after taxiing, they will follow their default path, or orbit their default waypoint
you don't need to build any taxi paths  If they are are on an airbase or carrier, and their TWR is too low for VTOL, they will automatically taxi to the runway for takeoff.

and what is that TWR?
Thrust to Weight Ratio  Heavy aircraft can't take off straight up because too heavy
You can see the TWR for AI aircraft on the equip tab

Lower fuel and loadout until it's.... 1.2 I think?
okokok
GAV-25s are suuuuuuuuper fuel efficient. The ones in Dyn Lib spawn with like 20% and flying from sector C -> A consumes less than half of that.

does a unit require engage enemies ON if I send that unit priority targets will it still engage them?
I want a UCAV to engage ground targets with its ATGM's but I don't want it to get distracted by players
Priority: yes it requires engage enemies on Designated: dunno "Attack target": no it will ignore engage enemies setting

ok but will the drone get distracted and attack players it detects even if it doesnt have its gun?
drone won't attack anything if it doesn't have a weapon, lol
As I understand it, for each type of target (air, ground, naval, stationary) the game has a list of weapons that are "highly effective", and a list of weapons that are "less effective".  AI will freely engage targets if they have a "highly effective" weapon against that target. So a fighter carrying a MRM or SRM will engage any hostile aircraft it detects, if engage enemies is on.  An AI aircraft will not always (not sure on details) engage enemies if they are only carrying "less effective" weapons against that target, but still can be ordered to attack that target manually.  An aircraft carrying unguided bombs won't normally attack a moving ship, but will if you set that ship as a designated target.

i guess slightly under 2.00 is realistic?
How do I change callsigns
Assign the players to a group

How can I set the target of rocket artillery in the mission editor?
Use a trigger action
Thanks

Can *single player* have it?
I’m probably just blanking
Wait…

Is it possible to measure lives left for a specific unit in the conditional editor?
I thought there was a condition to check remaining lives...
It checks for the whole team, and can't be used to measure a specific player

@Sypwn when Im sending a GPS point via system. Target Group is what? the GPS group?
Anyone interested in playtesting a PVE Vietnam War multiplayer map I've been working on?
Don't know. Test it and see what happens. Honestly I thought you would have done that by now instead of waiting for my answer.

Im just messin around, I need more time to test

People ask me "How are you so good with computers?" or "How are you so knowledgeable about the mission editor?"
Me:
I push every button and flip every switch to see what happens, then put it back together when I break it.
fuck I consider testing each gameplay mechanic I want to add but same time most of the conditional logic and event sequences Im doing are making the AI slightly more intelligent.  Honestly a Mission Editor Handbook wouldn't be a terrible idea especially with specifics like Unit Group has issues dealing with Players etc.

how the send waypoint to GPS trigger's "Target Group" property works?
That would be better to put in https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Editor/Events
Some of the features pertaining to 1.5. Ig we need to do more testing to see whats possible though...

Is looping removed currently due to the first node skipped bug?
No, looping was reworked (at my request) to be less confusing. To make a sequence loop, use the new sequence "Restart" action.
I could kiss you

Of course the real reason I pleaded was because the ol' `while` method would have turned this #mission_editor channel into a madhouse of "Why won't my sequence work right?" x8365
Restart only restarts the node or the entire sequence though?
entire sequence

Restart only restarts the node or the entire sequence though?
entire sequence
(it should, not actually tested yet)

is this what convinced Baha?
part of it, yeah
programerless behaviour

where tf is it? Im in PTE and Im looking in system
but, actually, I feel like the standard is that the programmer words have to mean the things they do, because thats how most level editors work, cause most level editors were made by programmers
if thats actually how while worked, used to work that is a bit silly

anyway to make mp missions for friends without uploading them to steam workshop? tried putting them in everyones customscenarios folder but they dont show up when hosting the mission
you can upload them and make it unlisted, that way only people with a link can see it
i think then i would still have to have mission content follow the rules of steam workshop

hmm well disregarding that part, if multiple people work on the mission, everyone of us would have to upload it themself yes before anyone of us can playtest it?, are there issues with beeing subbed to multiple missions with same name/etc?
wtf are you uploading lmao
:FloppaFlushed:

does workshop content have to be compatible with the base game, or can they be mod compatible only?
oh, is it just copyrighted music?
yep from bakrus

oh, is it just copyrighted music?
yep from bakrus
thats fine lmao

is the music even an issue?
wasnt there a version check when you join a server?
🤷‍♂️

wasnt there a version check when you join a server?
🤷‍♂️
honestly @MisterOutofTime i would just upload it with the music

you can do addition and subtraction now, is that not enough?
You can't add GV to GV
you can only add constant to GV

Where do the new spawn slot labels show up?
even if you did do what I was thinking, the number of 'ticks' required to do it would mess up everything
And I'm not just waiting for a pipe dream. Baha teased the most awesome thing but hasn't added it yet

Is there a char limit for the descriptions?
30
30 I think

remove the library and re-add it?
unless you install everything to the steam directory of course
restarting it worked this time, I was too fast to complain

@Sypwn are you going to be updating dynlib with the new 1.5 features?
or did you already do that
Some of them. I'll add slot descriptions and loadout recommendations real soon. For the trigger stuff, I'm not sure yet.

Does anyone know of a way to count the number of active players in a match?
Unit List (select all players) Num Alive
Sorry I should specify

Next question: can AI still jump over edges if their path goes through it?
Here for instance, would it jump from the ground to the platform?
I think it will vertically displace up to a certain limit. Although maybe not if it's an overhang like that.

Did you add recommended loadouts?
no I have limited Equips per spawn. Main Spawn: Access to Longbow Radar, AGM-114, PGM-27, AIM-92, Hydra's, Gun - 80km from Frontline Forward Spawn: Access to PGM-27, AIM-92, Hydras, Gun - 45km from Frontline FARP Spawn: Access to AIM-92, Hydras, Gun - 20/30km from Frontline

Do it!

is the recommended just a standard equipment layout upon enter a vehicle slot that they can change?
yes I should add a quickload kit for each spawn then
yes but the equipment is already on the hardpoint

does anybody know the distance of the mpa-155s arty fire?
very big
no clue, you have to find out by trial and error

Before I go insane, is this really the only way to do this?
It's taken me ages, even with file editing
These are relatively simple as they are a single action

Why did you have to do this 8 times?
For each individual player
if(playerX > radius) -> Murder them

couldn't you make a sequence containing only those 8 actions, and restart *that* sequence each time you need to restart them all?
use sequences as functions
That's what this is yes

yeah, but I thought you were complaining about having to create 8x8=64 restart actions?
No, just the lack of foreach loops
oh, yeah welcome to VTEdit

is it event sequence logic?
Yes
Conditions run BEFORE I spawn

have you looked at your player log?
I have done extensive enough testing that I've ruled it down to timings
I can get around them, with timers specifically

Is there a way to set the position of a carrier? I'm trying to randomize where the players carrier group spawns at
you can use alternate spawns, no?
with the new update is it only sequence's that can be reset because i cant seem to get triggers to go off more than once

you can use alternate spawns, no?

Correct. But sequences can take the place of the other trigger types.

@BrianAnim we just tried to play podrace and it's all broken - No countdown at the start - Spawn points don't move - No enemies at the top of the canyon - "Someone has won the race" (I think it was supposed to say who?)
I'm new to mission editing and I had a pretty basic question I couldn't seem to find when searching online or on here... How do you designate units and bases to a specific team? It doesn't seem like Enemy is Team B, but rather the AI enemy faction? I'm trying to make a PvP mission and this is really throwing me for a bit of a loop....
If you want it PVP you need to make the mission a multiplayer mission first

Then you can assign AI to either side

How do I assign AI to a side?
enemy units are team b
thats just how it is

So then if I wanted to have AI jets for Team B, they would use the ASF's?
yes
and Team B can use enemy bases while Team A can use allied bases?

and Team B can use enemy bases while Team A can use allied bases?
yes
awesome, thanks for the help!

I don't suppose there's a way to make an AI hostile to both sides?
nope
Dang... I was really hoping lol

what about for static units like Radar and SAMs? I want to try and create a trigger that'll have them swap sides
noooope
Noooooooo my idea.. lol

Is there an easier way to set an objective that requires you to stay in a zone for a period of time to complete? For example, you have to fly inside of a 5 km radius zone for 10 seconds before completing, but if you fly out of it, it resets the obj timer. The only way I can think of is chaining together delayed triggers, wasn't sure what the  best way to do this is
no but you can decide how long before an action is triggered in a sequence. Example: you could have a Pick Up mission for AV42C. The mission only completes once the troops are loaded. Now create an event sequence that tells the Troops to board the AV42C when it is landed and within proximity of a waypoint but delay it for however long you want a player to remain landed for + the travel time of the Troops pathing to the AV42C and loading. Then the objective will complete
In a part of the map far away from the campaign, you could spawn an infantry when player near waypoint, set the infantry to move a certain distance to an objective, then have when infantry at objective then: insert command. Having the infantry respawnable and killed when the timer is up

So I made a few hours of changes to a mission I've been working on this morning. I don't know what happened but I closed out of Vtol and left for a bit. When I came back and loaded up my mission in the editor none of my updates seem to be there from the changes I made and saved today. however I uploaded my changes to the steam workshop and it all seems to be there and okay. I've heard there's a way to retrieve your own missions from the workshop and convert them back to .vts files etc to pull up in the mission editor. can someone help me with that so I can get the changes I've made back into my mission files on my end?
@Strikeeaglechase

thank you strikeeaglechase, you're a legend

So I have this certain mission and many people can't figure out that a requirement in the mission is to stay low, what action can I use to warn individual players flying too high they are about to have a bad time?
put "DON'T FLY ABOVE ROOFTOPS" as the slot description for every slot
Im glad im not the only using slot descriptions as an alternative to briefings

Do you think that's sufficient?  Many people don't read text unless it's right in front of their face.
And the slot text is in front of their face
it will be in front of their face, many many times

is the "throttle" control message applied to the collective?
nvm "combat collective"
Those dont work in MP IIRC

Are running tutorial messages applied to new joining clients?
no
You can run a loop and detect when people become alive then show the message later (and as I learned yesterday, with a wee bit of delay)

wouldn't the result be idiot messages for everyone then?
You can do it for every individual player
You can do it for each *slot*, but not for each player

first off, how did you get these audio files?
recorded them with audacity
ok, are you using BGM or comms actions?

What is the range of the mad-4 radar? I want to make a path for the AWACS, but I don't want it to get too close.
success condition
55km but it will ping, spike, and range targets beyond that

Instead of setting the Loiter Begin Objective action, why not set Take Off to be a prereq of Loiter?
also 55km is arbitrary it all depends on launch parameters
right, I'll just put it about 70 km out.

Maybe something's up with your Loiter objective, I don't have much exp yet in this so don't take my word for it, but everything looks fine. Do you complete or fail the mission after take off?
complete
if I continue the mission all my objectives after take off work correctly

is it a singleplayer mission with forced equips enabled?
yes that would be why wouldnt it
🙂

complete noob question: are there any global variables? a number that the game can remember and can be changed when conditions are met

I gotta be missing something obvious
you need to make a campaign, make that multiplayer, make a mission in the campaign

more questions: is there any way to change the limited equips mid mission? like have an event where player completes and objective and as a reward unlocks the ability to use certain weapons
@Sypwn you can re-alive slots right? cause if true, you can have slots that are limited and slots that are not
and then give a live to the slot you want unlocked

@Sypwn you can re-alive slots right? cause if true, you can have slots that are limited and slots that are not

Wish you could limit equips based on the rearm point instead of the slot. Then you could have stuff like FARPs be able to equip less than a full airfield or carrier

How long does the smoke last on dead units?
Im trying to recreate some thing like this
Same bro same 😭 you can use looping triggers to spawn and kill a tank in place endlessly every 2 seconds and i guess it would give off smoke

is there any way to have a neutral unit or airbase? I wanna make a pvp objective where both teams are trying to capture it to gain a buff
No
But there is nothing stopping you from having them be one or another

So I made a standalone mission, but I want to add it to a campaign, how can I do that?
In the campaign editor
There is the option to import missions

Hey is there a way to adjust the mission/map editor UI scale? It's pretty unusable at my desktop resolution (4k), changed my desktop to 1080p and it was ok.

What do you mean by actions?

OHH

If I set the default behavior of an AI plane to parked, and then have it take off with an action, the action will overwrite the default behavior right?
yes
Ok cool, thanks

Is there anyone in here that can walk me through spawns and setting up AI Sam turrets real quick? I have an awesome PVP map I just made

> if its not hard in air spawns how to make them? scroll wheel up I think then place or move the unit. If it's a player, be sure to set that slot as FlightReady or FlightAP, and give it an initial airspeed
awesome man thanks a ton!
How do I rasie the spawn off the ground

scroll wheel (or is it ctrl-scroll or something?)
or enter a new altitude in those boxes in the bottom right corner of the editor
then once your editor cursor is in the air, move the spawn point

how do i make an enemy player?
make it a team B player spawn
Where is that option

do we have general range of the agm-89 fired from surface level?
ask #flight_school
nothing on the wiki because launch parameters affect capability ofc

Are they spawning on the ground? Or are you ordering them to land before this?
they spawn on the ground
What is their default behavior set to?

What is their default behavior set to?
path
Then they will take of and path, lol

ok they get in but very slowly they get in one at a time they run back and forth getting on one at a time is there a way to fix this or is this just a game bug?
uhhhhh sounds like a game bug
But again I don't have much experience loading infantry into AI AV-42s yet.

b4 someone makes Enigma's dynamic pvp server in VTOL and murders the game client with events all trying to run at the same time
actually, that would be a load of fun

Ah okay, so modifiable, I didn't see that option. That makes that handy. Are scores visible only in the lobby or is there a way to view it mid-flight?

Update is great - but can someone give an example where the respawnable option would be used pls. I wanted to have 'enemy' leave buildings - move on a path towards another building - and assuming the player didn't kill them they would then enter the building they have run to. Destroying them leaves a body on the floor. Is the above possible now - and does the new respawnable option enable the above scenario. Thanks.

Here I am with another question 🙂  How exactly do I set up a proper loop?  For context, here is the purpose for the loop:  I want ally aircraft to respawn at the airbase after they have been shot down. same for enemies. if they get shot down, there will be a 60 second cooldown, they they respawn and take off and head to battle.  currently I have that much going using the event sequencer. I set he event sequence to "start immediately" and the delay to 5 seconds just for testing purposes. as I remember, I set the ally aircraft to be spawned in at mission start, and the event sequencer just checks if the ally plane has been destroyed or not. the entry condition checks if it's alive. if its not, I set a "spawn" event followed by a "restart event sequence" event, all in one node.  however... when the ally plane dies, they spawn in IMMEDIATELY, without any delay. The delay timer doesnt seem to do anything in the event sequencer.  am I doing something wrong?
Can you screenshot the sequence?
Yeah, definately. gimme a moment to grab it

Can you screenshot the sequence?
Yeah, definately. gimme a moment to grab it
The delay occurs before the entry condition

ooohhhhh, I see... So I kinda gotta make it a 2-node sequence then. the actual spawning and restart will be in the second node, and the first one will be, for all intents and purposes, the "delay" (so to say0, cos it'll wait for the exit condition before heading onto node 2?
yeah that's one way to do it. Put the entry condition in the first node (leave the rest of it empty), and keep the delay on the second node
you can add to budget through events and stuff, but can you subtract from enemy budget?

you can add to budget through events and stuff, but can you subtract from enemy budget?
would be cool if you could have PvP missions where blowing up a strategic target caused the enemy to be less capable due to budget shortage
#public_testing

is there any VT file goofer to display global variables somehow?
Just tested this in the editor mission test environment and if that reflects the public lobby environment: I can confirm that "Display Control Message" does work in MP
nice

I have a quick question, so i tested my mission out and when i got to a certain objective it completed the mission even though there were still  3 objectives left, and i put them all on required, does anyone know what could be happening?
Did the required objectives show up on the MFD page at the time the mission ended?
yes and no, when the mission ended no other objectives were displayed until one of the aircraft i made triggered the next objective

Did the required objectives show up on the MFD page at the time the mission ended?
yes and no, when the mission ended no other objectives were displayed until one of the aircraft i made triggered the next objective
which then showed up

when i click on the link it is the "what are alt spawns?" paragraph is that the one you are refering to?
oh the wiki is weird, scroll up one line
okay

it also says that if the enemy completed their objectives but i havent set any up for them could that be a problem?
The player.log spits out a block of text every time it checks for mission completion. That might be useful to look at.
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

does anyone know exactly how "infAmmoReloadDelay" works?
okay thank you
does it reload only once it is all empty or periodically

where are the insert cam controls pinned again?
Are you just copying the text in the darker section? ```%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR```

so what do i do with player log?

search it for the last appearance of `Final Mission Completion Check Routine`

how do u want me to upload?
drag it here into the discord window then press enter

did you just restart the game and open the editor?
it was a little bit ago
yeah

The objective titled "Fly to waypoint" is completing, and there are no other objectives active at the time. It looks like you're starting another objective "Destroy enemy AA" immediately after, but it's too late. How is that second objective being started?
I just added this paragraph to my FAQ > Be careful to keep a "Required" objective open at all times until you want the mission to end. The intended method to do this is to use Prerequisite Objective Start Types, so that completing one objective immediately starts another. You can also put an Objective -> Start actions inside another objective's Completion and Failed actions section. Or you can have one "Required" objective that sits in the background for the whole mission, and is completed only at the very end.
It is being triggered by the waypoint proximity of the Fly to waypoint, as soon as they get in the proximity of the trigger, the next objective starts but then it says mission complete

so there is a separate proximity trigger that starts the second objective?
Yes, the fly to objective has its own proximity detecter and then i have a seperate one to start the next objective
but that prob isnt neccessary now

Does the Alt Spawn is rerolled on each Respawn?
no
you have to use a Conditional Action of Chances and Force Alt Spawn actions to re-roll it manually.

I want to make my mission multiplayer and I have it in a campaign how do I add another player spawn?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ>
literally the first question

what file? what folder? I'm talking about the campaign editor
ok I'm good now
we can't call them that anymore

Do you also live in my walls?
||redacted||
is there a way to make some infantry load into one players aircraft and others into another as an objective?

is there a way to make some infantry load into one players aircraft and others into another as an objective?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#av42boarding> You select which infantry should be loaded as part of the objective. You can split that up however you like.
ok so 2 separate objectives with different waypoints

@Sypwn what does the Start Immediately checkbox do?  if its not checked the event sequence has to be triggered before an entry condition can be met yes?
if its not checked, the sequence won't do anything until it's started by another action
ok so it works how i thought it did I was just having issues with some of my sequences starting too early

oh, because you have to restart the game so frequently?
yeah
though I think I figured it out I gotta change the value AND the minimums to allow for negative values

> I have it set on a per life basis Shouldn't you need to set it to per team basis then?
I haven't messed around with the budget stuff, but as I understand per life mode means the budget resets every respawn.
it does

is the moderator role really worth our pain in the editor?

we should stop, I enjoy this channel

Can someone please tell me how i create a Bullseye Point for a Multiplayer Mission?
its in scenario info in the mission editor
you create a waypoint, call it "bullseye" or something

what's going wrong? Log shows sequence restarting and all 3 nodes firing, but message 1 never reappears
Try making the duration of the first message ever so slightly slower
like 1.9 seconds

put my dummy node (no actions) back in at front and sequence works properly again - get msg 1 then msg 2 then msg 1, msg 2 etc etc. I'm surprised this hasn't been picked up before. lots of people have been using Restart in sequence  unless it is some weird situation with system actions one after the other in sequence?!
@Sypwn just seeking advice pls and noting my earlier misameanor "Did you just completely ignore what I told Monarch directly above?"   I'm happy to put things in VTOL Issues, but what's the difference between a bug and an issue? Is #public_testing reserved for issues (bugs) related to the most recent release? And thread vtolvr-issues for other issues/bugs ... just asking.   I have identified 'issue/bug' with Restart - see last few posts. I guess it should go to  vtolvr -issues2
Interesting. This was actually a bug in v1.5.0p16 (one of the testing builds) that it would skip the first node after restart, but that was fixed for the release, and I haven't had any problems. I won't have access to VR until sometime tomorrow.  If you make a new blank mission on Akutan and just add a player spawn and that sequence, does it still happen? If so please make a new thread on #vtolvr-bugs and include that mission's vts file.

then alter its name

It that something easily figured in the editor?
🤷 I normally don't use the editor maybe @Scralar knows
Aight I'll keep my eyes open here. Cheers dude

its my first time playing around with the ships movement in formation, anyone know a way to get them to move in formation without having to make a path for every ship?
@Sypwn
You can assign them all to a group, then order the group to move to waypoints, they will move in formation if you move them via unit groups

Is there a way to randomise music that plays during a mission? Just a random thought, but... I think it could be an interesting to do in some non-story based missions or pvp missions.
Use the "chance" condition to play the music
wait, that works on music? And a bunch of songs set at 25 percent wont try to... work against eachother?

if the box was already checked, yes. But otherwise the box is not present to be checked.

Did that FAQ answer your question?
Testing atm
Yes, it helped tremendously, thanks again

did akutan and simple 3 node sequence as suggested  and it worked fine!! went back to my original and it worked fine as well ... go figure. Your reference to fix in v1.5.0p16 might be the clue. I hadn't played VTOL for while and software might have been pre p16 then subsequently updated? I checked this time and i'm now p19. Is there a list somewhere of the p releases and dates? I can only find 1.5.x updates on steam. thks for assist!
you shouldn't be on p# anything right now. You need to switch to the stable branch.
1.5.2 is out on stable

Why? I've been on PTB for about 3 years. is there particular reason I should switch?
Because ptb is currently out of date. The 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 fixes were never pushed to ptb. Also, you never play multiplayer??
Oh didn't realise Stable was passed PTB - I'll change. Played multiplayer on my own when first released to see what it was like ... each time in somebody just shot me down - no warning no messages no nothing. Haven't been back since - might think about it again.

Is there a way to modify a mission found on the workshop?
If you are the mission creator yes
otherwise you have to ask the creator for the files

How do you enable the Gunner Seat in the Mission Editor for the Apache?  "Select the MP spawn in the editor and set the seats up to 2" Is that Slots or am i trippin bc i aint finding sth called seats
thanks
Did you create the mission as part of a multiplayer campaign? I'm guessing you made a singleplayer mission instead.

Did you create the mission as part of a multiplayer campaign? I'm guessing you made a singleplayer mission instead.
yes
To convert an existing singleplayer mission to multiplayer: 1. Create a new singleplayer campaign. 2. Import your mission into that campaign via the campaign editor. 3. Convert the campaign to multiplayer via the campaign editor.

Looking at the other channel, it had alt spawns before? Perhaps you hadonly enabled the second seat on Alt Spawn 2?
I'll take the silence as meaning it's fixed.
yes but now i cant load in

Other players? So you're hosting this for real, not just testing from the editor?
No
I've seen this before...

what VR headset do you have connected? This log doesn't seem to have any
Now I see why you have "bug hunter" I'm your bio
💀  Oculust Quest 2

And you're trying to select your slot and stuff in VR, right? You can't use the mouse in the briefing room.
mouse? from pc?
nah that not there

Was this log was taken immediately after you got stuck?
Or did you, like, restart the game after that
I may be reading it wrong, but this long only appears to have you starting the game, opening a custom mission in the editor, and nothing else. Nothing to indicate you tested the mission.

Anyone got a minute to help me with some mission editor basics? Im trying to setup what I think is a fairly unique version of a strike mission but Im new. I would love a mentor to hop in voice. Here is a sneak peak!
you should probably be using the weight function built into alt spawns
I thought that'd work.... but then the fighters also just choose one single alt spawn and never ghoose any of the others ever again 😦

Are you forcing alt spawn and spawning them all within the same action block? You should separate it by a tiny delay. Force alt spawn, delay 0.1s, spawn units.
Also to create an even 3-way split with Conditional Actions you need to make the conditions: If (chance 33) Else if (chance 50) Else
my power went off so im gonna have to try it tomorrow, but I did take some screensgots of how my setup looks

did you find the fix to this? i have the same issue
I need someone to provide their player.log file immediately after hosting a mission and clicking start mission. Or I need to set back up my VR, but I'm too lazy
lemme do that rq

something related to an objective?
OH
i set a blank objective i think

yeah how many objectives do you have?
1
blank

@[SPF]_CAPTPhilipp™ do you have any incomplete objectives with big red text at the top?
yeah i  give up
not on the using the brain part but the time it takes to go back to the editor lmao

big map with lots of city area?
yeah probably bigger than it needs to be for a few planes flying next to each other terribly
City area is a huge hit on load times. You can trim it down and repack the map

I'm just learning the mission editor and I didn't see an option to switch a base from red to blue. Is it possible to switch the alliance of a base in real time?
I was planning to do a capture the base type of mission.
There's an event action to change it

<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ> Just added two new questions: Q: How can I re-roll new alt spawn locations when I respawn units? Q: How do I make a random chance of something happening?
Question, I'm trying to allow for player choice in drop off objectives. So I have multiple drop off objectives targeting the same units. When I go to drop off the units, all the objectives get completed at once, where as I only want the one I actually complete to finish. Is this a bug?
isnt that conditonal?

like

Did u see that in the editor while my mission was loaded ?
How would I go about making "or" conditions. I want to make a strike mission where you have to destroy the targets OR kill all of the enemy aircraft so its kinda like a strike mission and TDM at the same time
do I set all objectives to not required since you can complete the mission without doing all objectives

What triggers a game to end? All required obj are completed?
yep
all required objectives for that team anyway

I seem to be having an issue with StaticObject references in the new 1.5.2. Haven't noticed this issue in previous versions. I am curious if anyone is experiencing the problem as well? When making a StaticObject reference inside the conditional editor my list of StaticObjects is just coming up blank even though I have StaticObjects.
I have tried to restart the game but no good still.
I noticed that only oil platforms are able to be referenced

Im now convinced that the issues I was having yesterday with the "force alt spawn" and wanting the units to respawn at random positions was infact bugged... because I now have the 2 fighters respawning consistantly and randomly, as I want them... in ways that the game doesnt really... account for.  think I should make a bug report? its, if i can truly confirm it, a fairly complex bug.  Posting this here, cos I believe its still a mission editor related thing, until later when I make a bug post.
Ah ok, thanks, good to know
same problem i checked what you told but there was nothing

is there way to transport infantry?
using units and not the AV42C
walking

I have two drop off objectives targeting the same units. When I go to fulfill one, both of them complete together, even though I'm clearly not fulfilling the other. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
sounds like it, but I'd have to see them to be sure
@Sypwn how does the MPA 155 work? because it says it only fires on a position when commanded to but how do you tell it to shoot and tell it where to shoot?

@Sypwn how does the MPA 155 work? because it says it only fires on a position when commanded to but how do you tell it to shoot and tell it where to shoot?

You could probably have ai despawn near a vehicle, have the vehicle drive to the drop off and respawn the infantry

Can the HB-106 attack and kill a carrier?
Not easily
how about 20?

so ive just started making missions, how do I make a unit attack a specific spot?
Im trying to get HB-106's to attack an airbase
add a waypoint

Is it just the bullsharks that can attack a carrier?
seems like dyn lib uses those as carrier cap threats
ASF-30 can as well, if you give them bombs and explicitly order them to attack it.

I've read the advice about making old missions multiplayer compatible except that I'm stuck with the step of "import your mission into that campaign" from which screen am I able to import a mission?
From the campaign editor for a **singleplayer campaign**, there's a button that says "import".

Functionality question: Can someone go into detail about the "unit detected" parameter in logic windows? My main thing is figuring out if it is persistent or not. For example: Player is detected by a radar system only for a moment. Later, the radar system is destroyed and no units are detecting the player- if I call a "unit detected" parameter following the radar destruction, will it print as true of false?

Normally a unit's "detected" status persists for the rest of their life. But Baha just added a "gets detected now" condition for players.
so that prints true of false if the player is within view ranges at the time of the conditional firing?

I believe he renamed the old condition to "was ever detected" which is more accurate to the original functionally
Also, number alive doesn't count stuff unspawned right?

Also, number alive doesn't count stuff unspawned right?
it didn't prior to 1.5. not sure if that changed
i.e. if I use it as the win objective (number of enemy forces alive is 0), that should be fine?

i.e. if I use it as the win objective (number of enemy forces alive is 0), that should be fine?
AI units that have never spawned in are considered alive
I see

it's different for player units, though, right?
cuz i made that work once
Best workaround is to use "num near waypoint" with a radius that covers the whole map. That will only count units that are presently alive

What's the best way to get ground units to follow a path in formation?
Put them in a group, other that group to follow the path

Hey, I think I've found a bug related to the mission editor but I'm not sure. let me check if you guys know anything about it first. It's a bit hard to describe but when you have player's MPspawns with lives and some other player spawns without lives, when you have all players switch to the new spawns that had no lives by adding lives to them, then set the lives of the aircraft they started with to zero it prevents players from joining even if there are free slots. it say's the lobby is full, even if you have it set to allow joining in progress. I've got a 6 player mission that has each player moving to 3 other aircraft as the mission progresses removing lives of their previous tier aircraft and adding lives to the next. once all lives get removed from the first aircraft and lives get added to the second aircraft for players to switch to, it seems like that's the point that the game someone stops letting people join the mission in progress. sorry for that being so long winded, not sure how else to describe it. anyone know what might be going on there?
No clue, not having the same issue
@Sypwn

ok so it will just restart itself? destroying the vehicle doesnt even happen?
Yeah I know....
but when the player is not near WPT 20,000m it doesn't destroy the vehicle

basically saying include a global value for the game to reference when deciding to kill a player. so both conditions are met. Is Not Near WPT and global value = 0 it will kill the player?
no, that was just for me to prevent people from taking off before a race
ok so youre saying add a altitude maximum?

ok so youre saying add a altitude maximum?
no lol. Its just an example of what i did
that was to prevent people from skipping parts of the race by forcing them to stay low

do you send it immediately at game start?
yes but I also send it whenever a player dies
so you can always see the BFM arena boundaries

what are you using as the ball?
No ball, had to be a little creative. You have to land a 1000lb dumb bomb on a tiny bunker perched on a spike to score. I took away the TGP because you could cheat with it lol
LOL

so camp by the goal and wait 1 minute?
Yep
LOL

i believe it works for gps bombs set to dumb mode? idk

Why would the plane be able to CCPR off of a TGP point, but not off a GPS point?
because it means that dumb bombs are in a Low Tech mode without the TGP\
mission design basically

so i think we agree?
no I have no idea what you are talking about
Arbitarailly less accurate when its a GPS point vs when its a TGP point?

Arbitarailly less accurate when its a GPS point vs when its a TGP point?
a point is a point, the aircraft shouldnt be magically more or less accurate
nonono you misunderstand me

> the bomb just doesnt have a terminal guidance phase arent dumb bombs unguided anyway tho?
yes but we have found out that you cannot CCRP a dumb bomb without a tgp
yes ok?

quick question how do i add allied units to enemy team? for example i want to place an assault carrier on team b but i cant, theres only the nfp one
you cannot do that
fr?

you dropped a TGP assisted CCRP dumb bomb recently?
idk bout recently bur sure
Why would it be any harder than with the TGP?

Why would it be any harder than with the TGP?
Dropping off the TGP and dropping off the GPS should be identical
it wouldn't you would just have more situational awareness with the TGP. Lets say the GPS target isn't sent to you and you have to place it manually thats a lot easier with a tgp compared to trying to mark a gps point in the nav map when the target is force undetected

you are simply saying its harder to get a GPS point than a TGP point?
yeah which is why I said we agree like 10 messages ago LOL add a CCRP mode for dumb bombs via GPS
this is what confused me

Does anyone here have any clue on how to make the AWACS work in the mission editor? I've got it set to take off and circle an orbit point, turn on its radar and have open communications. Am I missing something? he still comes back as if its not on station when requesting a bogey dope, RTB vector, etc.
how do you set rocket arty targets
there's an action to fire at waypoint

is there a way to set it for a squad instead of a single unit?
yes, put all the artillery in a unit group
i did

are there any other types of units in that group?
no
Oh, you're right. It's not there, and never was. My bad.

If I set rearm location to none will npcs rtb?
dunno

What is "------"?
an unnamed entity

anybody have any advice on how to make the AWACS work in a multiplayer scenario?
Just curious... before I make a proper bug report, does anyone else have issues where F-26 fighters can only take off once from carriers?   If you made them respawn, once respawed, they cannot take off from the carrier anymore and this is what the player log gives me:  -11752858 ModuleEngine.SetPower(0) -11752858 ModuleEngine.SetPower(1) -11752858 ModuleEngine.ToggleEngine() to False F/A-26B [38] requesting takeoff. F/A-26B [38] no runway for takeoff. -11755596 ModuleEngine.SetPower(0) -11755596 ModuleEngine.SetPower(1) -11755596 ModuleEngine.ToggleEngine() to False F/A-26B [37] requesting takeoff. F/A-26B [37] no runway for takeoff.  Take note, they do take off just fine the first time.
That seems likely to be a bug, when you post it make sure to include a full log file (and a vts file if possible)

No you can just slap her down
But she has to arms of her own and needs protection

Have you verified your game files?
I have
Can I get a screenshot of its settings

try removing the engage enmys?
I have events that set it to take off and circle the orbit point. Ok I'll try that
and fly wit it

it climbs to 33,000 feet and starts its orbit. I'm thing my waypoint is the issue. Maybe I set it too high in the air?
thats pretty high what height does the alt warn in the jets start
is it 30k or 40k

i swear its 40k so 30k for an AWACS should be fine(?)
its 40k, i have the default altitude and orbit altitude set to 10k and it just ignores it and climbs
I deleted it and the events and remade them all, going to try it now

Does anyone know how to set the visibility for a map I uploaded to public?

You can't. The bullseye location is set in the scenario information.

Is there a way to check if there are no enemies near a waypoint? I thought I might be able to use trigger event (Proximity, AnyEnemy, OnExit). But enemy units being destroyed don't trigger the event.
Use a conditional trigger event, not proximity
UnitList (select all enemies) num near wpt equals 0

Got another question for one of you wizards, I have a conditional trigger event, when tank is not alive, spawn tank. If you kill the tank it spawns again, but only once.  I thought maybe once the trigger condition is met, perhaps its no longer enabled. So I tried setting the trigger event to enable itself after spawning the tank - that didn't work either. Ideas?

how on earth do i setup ground artillery to fire on a waypoint? do i really have to manually create an event for every single one of them?
also, when making enemy planes take off, can i just set them on orbit when placing them in the hangars and, once i want them to have them take off so they will automatically move to their orbit waypoint without anymore input?  the way i have been doing it is set them to parked, then make them take off and have a second conditional event telling them to orbit once taken off
Yes

Hello there ! Does anyone has already made a scenario with infinite ammo ? I would have thought it'll take few days for variation of missions with infinite ammo to appear in multiplayer but I haven't seen any...
Anyone know if objectives that have been cancelled can be triggered again?    Say I want to start an objective, then cancel, then restart, then cancel.. so on.    Use-case: signaling directives for air superiority pvp missions (defend CAP, retake the CAP)
I think so

restarts just stop the event in its tracks and restart it i believe

why is the AWACS in my mission just responding with unable to everything? it is orbiting a point with radar and comms turned on. do i need to turn engage enemies on?
also my MAD4s dont start deployed anymore? do i use the event "park now"? or is it engage enemies
Is there some easier way to test longer MP missions? I usually set ammo to infinite and slog through until I get to the objective, only to find a bug and have to restart

Engage enemies for radar units is, IIRC, the same as "radar tracking". You need to have both on

Yeah. Or create the mission as a SP mission (so you can use the devcam gun and fast-fowarding), then convert it to MP after the triggers are tested.

Its not possible to convert MP back to SP is it?
Officially, no. But it's pretty straightforward if you already know how to do vts editing.
Alrighty, cool. Is there any good resources for VTS editing anywhere? I assume its like editing text documents and such?

Thankyou again

If ally fighters are set to "parked" and dont automatically take off, how can you make them take off, without setting a trigger?  here's my scenario: I want wingmen to be on standby on the ground. they will only take off if you actively call for your wingmen via "form up" or something like that... but if they are set to "parked" in their unit settings, nothing can get them to take off, unless you made an event or trigger that makes them take off.
you can tell ai wingmen to take off with the comms menu im pretty sure
I thought about the same, but... I dint actually see any take off command there. only refuel, rtb, rtb & refuel

So my soccer mode is nearly perfect, but there is one bug I am trying to fix.  How would I create a delayed respawn? For example a bunker is destroyed by a bomb and I want it to respawn 20 seconds after being destroyed. Currently it instantly respawns after being destroyed. This causes a rare issue where if two attackers drop bombs that are on target it allows their team to score 2 points in one round.
Anyone free to help test something? Look for Shamebird's lobby. PVP Miami map.

Is this about right or am I all wrong? This is a tad confusing to me lol sorry
I changed the exit condition "or" to "and" because both goals should be alive
Yeah, then restart the event sequence after a delay of 20 seconds

The time delay should be in the first or second node?
(Im doing 60 seconds for testing purposes)
2nd node

Any idea why that might be?
Where does the delayed goal respawn event get triggered?
Nvm then

Where does the delayed goal respawn event get triggered?
Nvm then
Its triggered by the completion of each objective

Does each objective complete when a bunker is destroyed?
Yes
the same bunker

Ok and set it to begin immediately?
Yes
But also add a 20 second delay on the first node

So thats all that would be needed?
You also need to delay the start of the next objective otherwise it all starts instantly
Ah gotcha

How would you go about doing that with my existing framework?
It's pretty difficult. I have made a similar mission easier and I just used event sequences for most of it
What if i switched from pre req to triggered and started the next mission with the respawn delay

So I'm having an issue in trying to set up a mission. I can't get allies or enemies to follow paths. Is there a good guide on doing it? I draw the path with points, have the vehicles spawn right next to it, set them to 'path' (and I've tried 'railpath') and they don't move at all.
Wondering if it has to be a 'only one vehicle can use the path' thing, and I need to set the rest to follow...? (Haven't used follow yet tho)
Oh hi Urban

Forced alt spawn index is 1 based right?
It starts at 1, yes
but internally, and in the player log, they start at -1 for...reasons.

Does anyone know the character limit per briefing page?
And per objective page
Nm. Found a rough estimate

Is there a dev log or console I can bring up whilst viewing dev cam? Some way to peek into the guts of a mission to see whats firing off?
I imagine not but I thought I'd ask just in case
https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/mfg6inev/ it's a mod but it's the closest thing we have

Alright, is there any reason, that all my AI and events wont work or fire off? E.g. SAM wont have radar, no AI do what the initial events say.
I've restarted my game, thought it could be that
No objectives, radio response

so my awacs was still not responding after setting it to "engage enemies". it was sharing its data trough data link, however it would not speak to us at all.  i had set him up to just take off. he then defaulted to orbiting his default waypoint. maybe he was still in "take off" behavior and would not respond? i set up an event now to properly change his behavior to orbit his waypoint after takeoff now, will test later if that fixes it
Alright, I'm working on an air-to-air mission. I want the enemy planes to spawn in after the player(s) get within a certain distance of a waypoint. Figured out how to make the trigger event, but how do I make it so the enemy planes don't spawn in *until* the player crosses that point?
Do I just uncheck 'spawn immediately' on all the units?

let me check

What units are members of EnemyEcho?
The log shows this is actually a problem with a unitgroup
yeah, but its for the ai wing leader code

hey fellas, I see that 'Alt Spawns' are designed for AI units, but has anyone figured out a way to make them work for player aircraft? I'm looking to utilize the ability to change loadouts from the altspawn feature for players, so a movespawn won't do in this situation as I can't adjust loadouts directly with those. Does anyone know if there's a clever way to accomplish this via vts editing or some other method, or am I out of luck using altspawns to set various loadouts throughout my mission in vtol's current state?
You have to use different player spawns
Each player spawn is associated one loadout, whether forced or not

Does it need to be a DM? Can we just make a thread?
sure, that will work.
Looking at the IComparer.Compare() bug, its kinda weird this hasn't broken the game completely

Something to do with enemy seagroup Mike I think?
In reference to everything else
Nvm i think this is it

Can I turn a path in the editor into a path in the GPS so it shows up on the NAV page? I have a small mission where the player can shoot some targets and go for a canyon run.
I think you have to use waypoints
I think that paths are only for AI

If I check for units like this, is there a way to check their height aswell?
I think you have to do it individually
Or use an objective fly to instead

Is there a way to respawn destroyed units? I got an event set to "Spawn All" but that only spawned units, that were not spawned before.
Spawn all respawns them if they are destroyed also
Can I check somewhere if that trigger actually triggered?

To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

I would assume an event can be triggered multiple times, correct?
if i sart a timed event does it continue to go untill i tel it to stop?
yes

if i sart a timed event does it continue to go untill i tel it to stop?
yes
oof

does what i dicsribed work?
not at all
oof

set a time delay for the event and then just tigger it after evry objective complete?
does this work @Sypwn?
wait no

Did you start the sequence or check "start immediately"? Did you check the "respawnable" box in the unit's properties?
one sec
slight goof

How would one go about creating a objective matrix that can have any group of 22 Groups of 4 infantry land at any 22 bases, without having to drop all 22 groups at one base, and without all 22 objectives completing at once due to a minimum of 4 infantry being dropped off at a single objective waypoint?  (I've already created an entire framework of events that react to any base being taken by any group, and leveling from short to long range, who owns it, etc.. This is just the last piece, and I can't think through it currently)  Fixed it: I eneded up using a event sequence of 2 minutes, that cancled the objective, reset it, then begain it, that was only fired by a conditinal event that had a condition of: All unit groups: IS NOT: Near waypoint (waypoint) distance.  then ran into a bug where if you set a rally point, and the infantry park at the rally, they couldnt be set a path or interacted with at all, so ended up moving the rally point to a diffrent than the drop off location waypoint to make everything work.
I think ISEGaming has experience with multiple dropoff points for infantry, but I don't want to ping them at 2AM EST.
I don't know enough about pickup/dropoff mechanics to offer a recommendation.

so setting the AWACS to orbit also didnt help. quick recap on my problem: the AWACS in my mission will only respond with "negative" or the likes. he does however share his data via data link. he is set to engage enemies, comms enabled and also orbit a waypoint.  going back to my older missions, the AWACS there also doesnt work anymore. is this an issue with a update?
I've had the same exact issue for over a week and yesterday I hopped into the premade F-45 mission and the AWACS did the same thing so I'd say it's a bug introduced with the update
How does the ship formation system work?

Is it normal that, upon takeoff, f 45 wingmen do not automatically form up on you? or is there an event I gotta add?

Idk if that would work though
Depends on how the game reads the file structures

It's on the wiki I imagine? (I'm checking anyways, rhetorical question)
I mention it in my tips article <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_tips>

Is it intended that if you put multiple ground units into a group they stop following their given path?
Hei guys 🙂 i made a little mission and wanted to test it. It has 7 basic objectives with lots of targets during a night time operation. It is nothing special but up to 15 people can fly together. Any tips on how to test it properly?
Fly it solo (if possible) before getting other people involved. It's quite frustrating to get a group together only for the mission to completely break 5 mins in.

I have a bomber set to fly along a path and deploy 8 ASMs, but in game it opens the doors, deploys one ASM, keeps flying the path with its doors open, turns around when it hits the end of the path and circles around before deploying another. How do I make it shoot off a volley?

I tried removing the path and allowing it to freely orbit a point within deployment range. It now deploys one missile and orbits with its doors open until either given another order or shot down. I have also tried spacing out the deployments with five second sequence delays.  No luck.
i dont think its possible

You use the same action to set invincible and remove invincible
The check box tells it which one you're doing

Question, is it possible to edit a workshop multiplayer mission in the mission editor?
Only if you are the creator
Ok, good.

what does "force detected" do in the editor?
Makes that unit show up on NAV to the enemy, regardless of if they've actually been seen or not.
Note it does NOT show up on the F-45 HUD/TSD because of a technicality. But it does show up on all units NAV page.

if i do that, woould it be viable to use the nav screen to use gps guided munitions?
im trying to make it so if you do recon in the previous mission, you do an easier version of the mission in which you have the targets gps locations
The player can indeed use it to manually create a GPS point based on location of the unit on NAV. But if that's your intent, you might as well also send them the GPS data directly.

hey. is there a way i can force an eject to a player and then end the mission successfully??
In SP? Not that I can think of
wanted to have a mission end with you ejecting and the next mission is to protect a group of heli to rescue said pilot

yeah
ah

and then make a dif event for each?
Not an entire event, just another action
ah

how do i make it send, do i need to do somthing to make it send at spawn?
Only players that are alive and in their cockpit at the time will receive the GPS coords. So you have to work around that
at what time though?

can i make diffrent gps groups send?
like one for radars, one for iraps, one for bunkers?
People wonder why all the custom missions are so similar with cookie cutter objectives. Then they try to use the mission editor and discover all the limitations.

sypwn, two questions.  if i complete a mission then eject it will still pass right?
two how to force eject or to force win a mission
I think that's the number you specify in the action properties

but if you win a mission you can still eject without loosing ???
Once the mission ends, its outcome cannot be changed
👍

is it me or does the f-45 have way superior AI and parameters than literally all the enemy units?  2x f-45 vs 2x asf-33 and the ASF units get absolutely descimated, sometimes without a single f-45 loss. this is repeatable... quite a lot.  2x f-45 vs 2x asf-58, same deal, if anything, the asf-58 planes fare even worse.  for a multiplayer game where both teams have some AI units flying around, as im trying to make, this makes it extremely unfair for one team, giving a large disadvantage to one team, and a big advantage to the other. it makes it so the mission I wanna make is kinda impossible to make
I'll see if I can confirm this tomorrow, i've been struggling with this for over an hour. I hope its just me being tired, but if this really is the case, I guess I simply cannot make the mission then
asmrm-7s are pretty dogshit, especially compared to 120ds

wonder if the asf-30 would be a more fair balance?
prob asf-30 or maaybe 33 yeah
I figured the lower thrust of the other two would give it a disadvantage

i mean you could just give team b more numbers, no?
I could, but there is a score counter that keeps track of team kills. first team to x kills win.  I mean, I probably could change the goals a bit
The AH-94 Proficiency Test mission has an objective to escort a tank under fire. It's actually invincible except when it gets really close to an enemy the player hasn't killed.

well having ai v ai count for that might not be the best anyway? idk
could probably set up a way for team b ai deaths to count as less tho..
true. but that does still mean one team will have more enemy AI targets shooting at them

Im trying to test a mission scenario im creating and when I go to load into the map from the loadout/briefing room it my view goes black and it freezes. I assume it is crashing or stuck loading infinitely. Any idea how to fix it?

aaah sweet. Thanks! ill try that

Oh boy, what exactly happens when I repair it? Obviously updating it to the latest build and such, my last update was just before 1.5.5
It corrects the mission and campaign metadata.
Before anyone asks, I do have it backed up online and as a ZIP, so I am fine if it royally borks it. But I did find some new trigger bugs I gotta fix

is there a way to make a group of ships follow a single path in a formation? Or do you have to make a parallel path for every ship unit to follow individually?
if you put them in a group, and order the UnitGroup to follow the path, they will use a Vee formation.
oh cool thanks!

Can the trigger events be re-enabled once they fire off to be used as a loop? Or do i need to make use of the sequence?
Okay, nevermind, but another question arose. When using event sequences, do all of the nodes check their entry condition, or only the nodes before which another nodes have fired off? To put in another terms: Do nodes need to fire before another node for it to fire?
is it like if then if then if then...  or more like if {} if {} if {} if {} .... ?

They will enable a single time per conditions met So  if: unit: alive Then: kill  If unit: is not: alive  Then: spawn  Would lead to an infinite loop

how could I make a singleplayer mission for a modded aircraft such as mirage 2k or gav-25?
Theoretically you open the mission editor with that mod active, and the vehicle should show up as an option
or would that break on the workshop

okay but I could send the raw files for the modded mission to another player and it could work?
yeah

no

akutan is just quirky that way

i plan to make use of this new respawnable setting just gonna figure out how it works does it work through an event/trigger? or when i tick it on lets say a bomber if he dies does spawn back in a set time
and lets say if we captured an airbase where he respawns id have to trigger an event to stop it

<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#sequenceloop>

Im trying to make a engage enemies toggle event. as of right now I'm using the fuel port as the toggle switch. its supposed to set a unit group to attack the player when open and toggle them off when its closed. as well as tell teh player they have been toggled to passive or hostile with a tutorial message. but when i toggle the fuel port switch it doesn't do anything?
any tips?
Cockpit controls don't work in multiplayer

What are you trying to accomplish tho?
damn
i wanted to make a lobby for me and friends to practice shooting at AI jets that are default not aggressive but then have the ability to toggle them to become aggressive at any time with a switch in the plane

@Strikeeaglechase @THE GREAT OVERLORD OF ALL CHEESE do you know if radars or launchers have minimum engagement ranges? And if so, what they are? I have a SLAM truck linked to a SAM S/A Radar and it only seems to lock+fire within a very narrow range window.
Yes some have min-range, ill check what its set to for the slam truck
1km

is there something else I can try so balance a red vs blue team mission where one team's AI (the blue team) just doesn have MASSIVELY better specs and destroys the other team? balancing is pretty much impossible when the AI f-26 takes 2 missile hits to destroy and every red AI plane takes only one, and gets out maneuvered (asf-30 vs f 26 has a 1;6 kill ratio in the f26's favor.)
not beyond what I've already suggested
only somewhat balanced fight is f45 vs asf33, and the f46 is, arguably, not even a fighter

what channel does he watch? never really saw a suggestion channel. cos having AI planes of the same types on both teams would solve the multiplayer issue instantly (both sides can have asf planes for Ai and both can have F series planes as AI)
oh thats damn true, lol
#vtolvrdev ?

thanks for the info guys. Ill... I guess post the idea there? cos I really reached my limit of what I can do with the mission I wanted to make.
Post it there, but its a semi-major change so don't keep your hopes up lol
Sadly

does anyone know what the maximum length of a description you can have for a mission in the .vts file is?
I have been trying to make a map but when I click save so I can load into the map nothing happens does anyone know how to fix this?
Normally when you save it briefly shows floating text at the top saying "saved" or something like that

It does not

what if you save as?
there is no save as
I can not create a mission to begin with

can you send a screenshot of where you're stuck?
@BahamutoD I'm getting the same thing. Can't create ~~a new standalone mission.~~ any new missions.
This is for campaign

Is there some way to add a benefit for ejecting before you get killed/the pilot surviving?
nope
Hey another question, Is there a way to choose your spawn point between a few areas WITHOUT adding additional planes/ players?   (IE: I want to have One type of each aircraft that the player picks and then give them a choice where that plane spawns in.)

You can use multiple slots to represent each spawn location, and with fancy trigger work make them mutually exclusive so you don't raise the player cap. ```Alpha 1-1 - Spawns on Airbase A Alpha 1-2 - Spawns on Airbase B Alpha 1-3 - Spawns on Airbase C Bravo 1-1 - Spawns on Airbase A Bravo 1-2 - Spawns on Airbase B Bravo 1-3 - Spawns on Airbase C``` As soon as Alpha 1-1 spawns in, Alpha 1-2 and 1-3 are locked out. As soon as Bravo 1-2 spawns in, Bravo 1-1 and 1-3 are locked out. etc

What are the units in the vehicle speeds? I.E is fast 30 30 kts, 30 kmh?
m/s i believe
Editor units are all in metric

Are units in a group?
not sure
the gunboats are for sure cause there's 3

and the completed event is when the obj is done correct?
yes
how far is this radius 10? does it mean 10k?

in the editor can i play the battle from 2d? like spectate it all. i want to make sure units are spawning at the right time

So if it's a multiplayer mission, you will need VR to start it, but then you can use the devcam to observe the AI behavior

but where do i clikc file, scenario info? in the editor?
yeah
Quick question: How many of you guys and girls use the "Health percentage" slider in mission editor, as a condition?  Like for example, make it so if an enemy is at 50 percent health, they get destroyed?  Its... a cool setting that kinda helped me a lot right now with my "f26 are flying tanks" issue.  To those with issues, Give that conditional a try... That is, if its underused...

So I made a basic 1v1 MP mission for a friend and I to practice missile avoidance. How do I set it up to where we can play together? Do I upload to workshop and add it like a regular workshop mission?
if it's a MP campaign then yep just upload it and run it like any mission

awesome, it is, thank you!

Hey y'all I just have a quick question.   Is it possible for vehicles during the initial spawn to be in cold spawn mode, but in subsequent respawns, have them in flight ready mode? Or is it just one or the other for the whole mission?
If its on a moving carrier, no. Otherwise, yeah just "move" the spawn to the same location but change it to hot start. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#movespawn>
alright cool thank you! I'll check that out now

does anyone here have experience with AI using Aim-9e missiles? im not sure if im doing something wrong, but f-26 AI simply refuses to use those missiles. and they barely use guns too, even if placed right behind a non-engaging red aircraft. they just kinda dance around wildly and never aim, then disengage, take a WIDE circle and do the same thing.  asf-30's however, they use their rear aspect missiles and guns PLENTY.  possible bug, or am i missing something in the editor?  if its a bug, i'll make a report tomorrow when my power is back on.
Yeah that sounds like a bug
I rarely touch Team A AI units

The bigger question is, how did you miss the pinned FAQ link?
you're right.
@Sypwn moderator colour change??

That renders mission base names useless, right? I was going to use it to change the name with ownership change in a campaign. It's not a huge deal. I'll just pick a name and stick with it.
how do i select multiple units at a time to copy them
you can't

Out of curiosity, why are you trying to copy a group of units?
The only time I would have found that particularly useful was before unit respawning was added.  Otherwise single unit copying covers most of what I need.
*Triggers, however...*

triggers and events can't be copied right?
Only by doing it manually in the vts file.
i’m making an old tech a2a battle cuz i can’t find any and have never made a mission so i thought it would be fun, but i want to copy a squadron and place them in a different location

Are the different members of the squadron different types of aircraft?
If not, copy one unit to the new location, change its group, then copy that unit to fill the rest of the squad
i’ll add more aircraft and different aircraft as you progress

this was supposed to work, right? but it keeps adding funds every 5 seconds even if the unit is alive, after the first entry.. c'mon i can't be that dumb can i?
if i put a friendly aircraft in my aircraft group (alpha, etc..) with they fly with me and follow my commands?
Only in singleplayer missions

if i put a friendly aircraft in my aircraft group (alpha, etc..) with they fly with me and follow my commands?
Only in singleplayer missions
doesnt necessarily needs to be in the same group. you choose "force player commands" in the unit

Which condition is that you're showing? I see two entry conditions
first one
what's the second one?

You said the trigger fires continually even if ASF-33 [19] was never killed?
after the first kill, it continues to fire repeatedly even after the unit respawn
Now I'm trying to remember how Alive checks work for respawning AI units...

is initial delay in seconds or minutes?
seconds
great thanks

Is it a SP standalone mission, SP campaign, or MP campaign?
hey how do you make someting spawn the same time as you
like you die right

an AI will spawn with you, how do you do that?
If you need to do it once, a conditional event
If you need to do it multiple times, a looping event sequence

can you post a screenshot of what you have now?
yeah just wait a sec
and the event sequence?

But what's this attached to? A conditional event?
i was ussing trigger events not sequence
ah

So the problem is you want the AI to spawn in when you spawn in (after 5 deaths), but instead it's spawning it when you die (after 5 deaths)?
yes
exactly

do I just put nothing in node 1?
Just an exit condition, nothing else
This FAQ answer may also be a helpful read: <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#sequenceorder>

did you disable or delete the old conditional trigger?
not when I spawned
yeahh

should I put start inmediatly?
yeah
didnt work

can you drop your player log?
how do I do that?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

What's wrong with the oculus link?
im using a cable

Nice, very nice
If you start your MP3 player while mission BGM is playing, your MP3 player will override and stop the custom BGM (instead of playing both at the same time). If you then pause the MP3 player, it won't resume the BGM, so the result is nothing is playing anymore.

Can you make a radar seek an individual target, and ignore others?'
With AI? No I don't believe so
try this in the unit options:

you tried commands via comms page?
yeah
cuz ive just tested this 5 min ago

Are they in a group?
I tried. Can you share how.
Check the "respawnable" box and then trigger the spawn action after they die

How do i tell the group to follow the path?
All i want them to do is keep moving.
There's an event action UnitGroup -> Name of group -> Follow path (or something like that)

Are there any plans to make the mission and map editors compatible with 4K displays? Right now the UI is scaled for 1080p resolution, and everything is almost frustratingly small to click on.
Not that I'm aware
Okay then, no worries.

Is it possible to display a message to only one player or selected players? It seems that you can either displayy a message for everyone on a team or to everyone in the game (on both teams)
Nope
Damn it!

But it shows that to everyone or everyone on the team right?
Shows to everyone
I will explain what I have made and maybe one of you brilliant minds can help me with the last puzzle piece: I have essentially create an Among Us game mode. There are 4 players, each game one of them is chosen at random to be the "alien". If the alien dies or If all 3 humans die the game ends. This is all working properly. However, I do not currently have a way to let the alien know that they are the alien while not telling the humans who the alien is.

they spawn in differente locations?
do they see each other on spawn?
They will show up on NAV. No way to prevent that

do they see each other on spawn?
They will show up on NAV. No way to prevent that
i don't know if it's the smartest solution, but the first thing that ocurred to me is use a 'flare' in front of the players blue for humans red for alien for example for 5 seconds

may i ask how u did it?
oh yeah, chances. ok
Yes using chances but I also had to make it to where there is a max limit of imposters and there is always that amount

How do you make a multiplayer mission?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#converttomp>
The thing is called just "path". And it worked. A bit unintuitive. And i wouldn't have found out myself. But it works. Thanks so much.

Map? Or mission? Also, link it?
ill link it in a bit, mission
im editing my video

in the objective editor if you set it to "final" for start does it not appear until all other objectives are complete?
Correct
Hi! I'm trying to figure out how to make your wingman land at whatever airbase the player is at, and then take off when the player doea something like start their engines. I've tried using a conditional event and a waypoint event to land the wingman. The problem is that the wingman won't take off again even if the takeoff event is triggered

How many points can a path handle, what would be recommended?
I have paths with hundreds of points
okay great

Is it possible for different vehicles to have different RTB way points at the same time?
afaik you can't, but you should be able to change the waypoint with triggers
Okay, thanks

Also, I have enemy planes on a carrier, and have the 'engage enemies' box checked, but when I engage the strike group, the planes don't launch to engage in the battle. Is there a way to make them engage?
Order them to take off with trigger actions
you can make it conditional on the player getting close

How could I do that?
You're lucky I have the editor open already (forgot to increase the radius to something reasonable)
But you should really try to figure things out yourself first

quick question regarding BGM: There is a "play bgm" event that I can use to play music, but how can I cycle between songs, instead of just looping the same song over and over?  wondering if im missing something
Does playing a different BGM not stop the previous one?
My guess is you just tell it to play a different BGM, but I haven't tried it myself.

<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ> Added: Q: How do I make a ground unit follow the road? Q: Can I despawn or teleport AI units?
Wow, after struggling for a bit I finally figured out everything needed to make it so you can have troops pre-spawned and perform a load/unload sequence.  Here's what you need along with the entry conditions needed for it to transition correctly. Without the first entry conditional, (is not landed), the aircraft will orbit its takeoff location. If the second conditional is excluded, the troops will not unload from the craft.
already figured it out but thanks

Does anyone know how to make a wingman land and take off with the player?
Can you RE-trigger a timed event? Or is it just objectives that can now be reset? Thanks.

Is there a way to track if someone has ejected in the mission editor? Having "ejected" as a trigger condition?  I'm working on mission with CSAR aspects, so that if you're shot down you have to go pick up your pilot before you can get back into the action. I'd like to be able to track if someone successfully ejected or not and give them different pickup objectives accordingly.
nope

Like how? Every time I use the land command, I can't get the wingman to take back off

Like how? Every time I use the land command, I can't get the wingman to take back off
Oh, not sure why they wouldn't take off when ordered to
I've tried using both conditional and proximity events. It seems that once a wingman has landed and powered down, they won't power back on

its not ideal but you could spawn in new ones?
ideally this should work tho
they should be able to take off again

@Sypwn even if I use the "player is not landed" condition?
I guess what I'm asking here is what defines the "landed" condition?
Wheels touching the ground

Same for wingmen?

I want to leave aircraft as props. I set their default behavior to parked and unchecked "engage enemies." Is that good?
Was late last night and didn't get to test it. I'm at work rn
Yeah. Just be aware that enemy units will still attack those "props" if they get the opportunity

Like, using attack target actions to force blue on blue? I planned to test that later.
yep, but it wont work if the aircraft has missile equiped, it will attempt to attack the target with missiles, but either the radar, the missile, or some part of the missile attack routine has a friendly fire check, so it will never launch
bummer

Is there any reason my tanks aren't moving?
I've been trying all day and they won't move
Switch from rail path to path

Is there any other change?
I had it set to path earlier and it wasn’t working, so I tried railpath
Try ordering the entire group to follow the path using a timed event

Wait... how do you give both teams in MP a KC49?
you can't
...oh

....can you just bum off the enemy teams KC49?
actually, I think so?
Problem solved! :^)

Are the radii in the conditional editor ETC in m or km?
m
and we don't have a conditional inversion?

and we don't have a conditional inversion?
e.g. NOT near waypoint?
distance greater than instead of less than

Wait, why can I only put down 1 enemy spawn for a pvp mission?  I thought each spawn was where each slot/vehicle would spawn?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#converttomp>
Mmmmm, I ticked the box for MP and it says its MP when I go back and open it again, but I'll give this a try

Question guys. Is BGM in missions limited in volume? I really want to have loud bgm, but even at 100% volume in settings, it's really quiet, even if I amplify the absolute ass out of it in audacity.
The same goes for "sound effects," I can't find a viable way to make it sound like anything is loud enough to give it an actual meaningful affect in-game. If anybody has any tips lmk
You can't rely on BGM for anything serious to the mission. Many players have it turned off in the game options, either for preference, or so they can safely stream the game.

Quick question regarding the radar of the f-26 vs the asf-30...  the map im making is a 200x200km map, however the f-26 planes detect and engage planes that are more than 3/4rds of the map away. thats 3 times more than the asf-30 planes can even dream of detecting planes from... so its really impossible for me to isolate squadrons to certain parts of the map without events.  is that a bug?   cos right now, I need to figure out a way to force every single plane undetected for the f-26 AI, as well as make them get destroyed, ontop of the event that destroys them at 50 percent ehalth, cos they tank missiles, lol....  if this is a bug and not just me missing something, ill make a bug report tomorrow.
I should probably add: I flew in a f-26 in formation with the AI f-26... and they outranged my own radar by a looooot as well
the ASF-30s radar is about 20% worse than the 26b's (inverse square law prob means its *range* is less than 20% different, but thats output power), the AI 26b has an identical radar to the player radar

Are you sure they are getting targets on radar and aren't just turning to them via RWR?
we were waaayyyy out of RWR range as well (I got no RWR until we got way closer, like half the distance?).   when I flew on the red team with the asf-30's,, we (eventually) got within RWR range, but the asf-30's had zero response and even turned away from the very quickly approaching f-26's
so yeah, im... gonna play around tomorrow a bit and see just... what's going on. I could honestly just be making a mistake

Yeah just looking at their stats I don't see why they would behave differently

Question regarding non target lists.  If I add non-targets to a fighter group... does that persist through their death? meaning if I respawn the group - does that list persist or do I need to re-action that?
I think it does for a group. Not sure about individual units though
But you should test it

In a sequence - Does the delay happen before the entry condition.  Does the delay happen before the action? When one node finishes... does it immediately do the delay on the next node? or fire the node then delay? I'm just confused on where the delay takes place.

No, not without mods. You could always use SAMs but they arent the same

I'm building a mission and like to add a tunnel like in the first map, but I see no options in the map editor to do this . Is this possible?
it is not, the game uses height maps to generate it's terrain which don't allow holes to get poked into them
the original map "akutan" was made without the use of heightmaps

In one of the recent updates, the developer, stated that you can use loops in the sequence editor, has anyone figure how to do this?
Ive kinda confirmed its a bug. the moment I put a certain event in for the enemy group, the f 26 will spot the asf 30 at 129km out.  the moment I remove the event, the f-26 will detect normally.  the event in question is to just add "orbit point" and set it to "none" and leave the altitude and radius values as is. that, somehow, forces the asf-30 to be detected.  I took a video and I'll make a proper bug report in a few minutes.  Edit: now im just confused, as I test it more. cos it seems it isnt the orbit event, but rather the fact that the asf turned really hard that made the f 26 see it. but even so, that makes little sense cos there are zero RWR spikes....
Ok, yeah. it isnt a bug with radars or detection ranges or anything likt that. its literally just that the f-26 detects you way before you recieve an RWR warning, if you make hard turns.  asf-30 doesnt detect you at all, but the moment you have an rwr warning and you turn really hard/show your rear end, he detects you.  so yeah... F-26 radar range extends past its rwr range...? which doesnt quite make sense, but that does actually explain things

Is it possible to spawn in a player AV-42 with soldiers already inside?

Is it possible to spawn in a player AV-42 with soldiers already inside?
I think so?
Should be an option at the top of the AV42's properties window

is it possible to edit that in via the VTS file?
I wouldn't try it. If it's disabled in MP, that's probably for a reason.
I think I remember discussing this before, and Chase confirmed it wasn't synced or something.

put the infantry there to be picked up?
or put them wherever the player spawns
I think I'll just have the AV-42 spawn at the platform

where did you want it to spawn before?
it's possible to edit the VTS to spawn infantry on the deck of a carrier
Oh?

How would you go about spawning infantry on the deck of a carrier?
create waypoints where you want the infantry, then copy those waypoint positions into the infantry's positions
After you attach the AV-42 to the carrier deck, you can use that position as a reference point

does if matter if the carrier is moving?
you have to do it before the carrier starts moving
ok and to get the infantry to get into the player AV-42 it's just the same as as if they were on the ground?

ok and to get the infantry to get into the player AV-42 it's just the same as as if they were on the ground?

Looks like the ID number inside WorkshopItemInfo.xml changed somehow. made it match the one on the workshop seems to have fixed it.

So I screwed up. Lost my mission files, but a test version of the mission is still on steam.  I didnt follow advice of keeping a backup as I should have, and its biting me now.  is there a way I can recover my lost mission from steam and mitigate atleast a little of the damage, so I dont have to start from scratch? the files in the steam workshop are encrypted, so they aint gonna work

Is there a way to unlock a specific "weapon loadout" mid mission? (Ie: after unit x spawns --> allow agm 88 to be chosen in load out. )
You'd have to have a separate slot that starts with 0 lives, and add lives later to unlock the slot and the weapons it can access.
You can then lock out the old slots forcing the players to pick the new one at next respawn.

How can I send GPS points, in path mode, to players?
Nevermind. Its in system events

50km+
Closer to 100km would be safer

If I do not select an airport to land at for the Gav-25, will it land at the location it took off from? or will it just disregard the land command?
If it has auto RTB enabled, it will land at the closest allied rearm/airbase when it gets low.
so the rearm stations it will vertically land to?

after the crash happens, upload your player.log

you want the whole thing?
the whole log, yes
have fun

Are you sure this is the whole thing? It doesn't show any crashes. And why is it called "message.txt"?
probably becausse of how many characters it is, discord will automatically do it sometimes, could also be its off notepad. and the crashed happened 2 minutes before this

Question: how much health does the different planes have?  every single other plane dies when taking a direct missile hit (as you'd expect) except the f/a-26... if thats a bug, I have taken a recording of it and will make a report, but I wanna make sure if its intended before I actually do that.
> every single other plane dies when taking a direct missile hit (as you'd expect) except the f/a-26 Iv seen the F-45 tank missiles many more times than iv seen 26b's, unless you mean AI?

In these stats, the f/a-26b has its "wingrightpart" health at 50, but its "wingleftpart" is at 1... why is that? just curious.  also, sorry if this discussion might need to go to the dev channel        "health": 50,       "minDamage": 0,       "name": "wingRightPart"
 and        "health": 1,       "minDamage": 0,       "name": "wingLeftPart"

I don't think its meant to be like that lol

ah, lol, fair, fair.  huh... Yeah, I guess im gonna have to use a workaround? but then again, the asf-30 has 40 health, same as the f26, according to the .json's

I've created about 10+ missions and having a blast. However I'm not trying to get enemies to spawn with a trigger. I set the enemy units on the spawn immediately not checked and then use a trigger to spawn unit.  It doesn't seem to be working. Amy I missing something? Is it just those two things? not spawn immediately and then use a trigger to spawn it?
You've got it. Can you send a screenshot of the trigger you're using.

Question: what triggers "auto rearm" in AI units?  Specifically, how low on ammunition does a unit need to get before they go rearm? because I have to add a few bombs to some AI units to bring their weight up, but those bombs will never get used. im afraid that since the plane will always have those bombs on it, that Auto rearm will not trigger
Also, during rearm, do ai units also refuel external fuel tanks, and re-equip them if jetissoned?  seems like an odd question, but heres my reasoning: Players have to manually re-equip stuff they jetissoned. if jetissoned, thyey are no longer "part of your loadout" due to the whole pylon being yeeted.  as for refueling external fuel tanks... if it is still on the plane and not "fired" like a regular missile (no empty, yet present, pylon) then does the AI actually have the knowledge to realize "hey-ho, the internal fuel is now refueled, now its the external tanks' turn!"
Currently there is a bug within the mission editor in which certain triggered events only show for the Host, while timed events show up for everyone in the server. I am using this bug to my advantage to be able to send messages to the host only during missions, but i fear that when the bug is fixed i will lose this mechanic.

Recommended weapon loadouts not saving in mp mission. Is this a known issue? Set up 4 FA26 with cruise missiles and and a 65' on pylon 1 and 10 - but it won't save the agm 65s only the cruise missiles. Tried padlocks open and closed and various combos.? Any one else had this. Thanks
"Won't save" meaning if you save, exit the editor, and open it back up, those slots show no overrides?
for some reason it skipped over the first node enitrely and immediatly played the second node, can i have a little help?

Hmm, I don't think the AI can VIFF, but I also don't think you can force it to stall. My guess is it will ignore orders to fly too slow.

Best to test and find out.

Tried it on new missions/maps same issue - then (should have done this before...) checked game files integrity - 82 files with issues re-acquired. When 100% OK made a new vanilla map - v small island - one base - only way I could get the loadout on any aircraft type I placed as a mp spawn to show in briefing room was to lock the padlock on that slot. Any open slots with stuff I wanted to just recommend still didn't show in the briefing. I made sure all weapons were 'available' and  tried on a carrier (where I found the issue) and on land air bases - nothing sorted it. Got the green recommended loadout modal far left of loadout screen but nothing showing unless I padlocked it in the editor. I'm on stable branch. Appreciate you checking you don't have the same issue - not sure what to do next - other than just leave it. Does anyone else reading this have, or has had the same issue?
> Any open slots with stuff I wanted to just recommend still didn't show in the briefing You clicked "load recommended" and nothing happened?  Can you send me the .vts file?

It shows a lot of other things too. It's pinned for reference.
so this sequence is triggered by a completed objective, which also stops another sequence currently playing music. the stop music thing works properly but it instantly skips goes to peacekeeper loop and skips over peacekeeper initial. I've tried adding a delay to peacekeeper loop but it just plays peace keeper intial then instantly skips over it the momment the delay is over

I made a loop = true path type bezier for a formation of carriers, but everyone stops after a while.  How can I troubleshoot this?
So they follow the path for a while, then stop?
yes, I think it might be back at the start of the loop

they are assigned to a group and appear to hold formation
their chosen formation, I put them in one order and the ships shuffle around as they gain speed

does mp vs single player make a difference?  How about sub-orbital mp spawn heights?
*sub-orbital?*
yeah, asking for a friend.  He wants to know if 100,000 - 200,000m spawn heights will break the path loop

Can you create a single player campaign then convert to multiplayer?
yes, requires some trickey after, sypwn knows how
Good to know, thanks

In what situation is this used, just wondering?

How do i edit the max Player count in a scenario. It says i can only have 8 players but i want 12. is there any way to change it at all?

How do i edit the max Player count in a scenario. It says i can only have 8 players but i want 12. is there any way to change it at all?
Max players per team is limited by the number of player spawns on that team. Additionally, the max players total (both teams combined) is 16.
If you placed AH-94 spawns, they default to single seat. You have to change Slots to 2 for each one to allow a gunner.

that makes sense as to why i can only have 8 players per team.  can you change the total max of 16?
I will definitely steal the runway measurements tyvm 😊
I dunno what kind of awful diagrams you have seen with no runway length indicators

what is the best way to create a variable ticket system for lives? im trying to make a VTOL rushish gammode where each point taken adds more tickets to the attacking team. They only way i can think to do it is very brute force
I was hoping there would be some way to do it with global values, but then I need to run an "alive" or spawn check for each of the attackers to increment the counter. IK you can use score to keep track of deaths of the team, but the problem with this is that it makes the ticket integration a bit more clunky, especially if i want to add optional objectives that increase the ticket counter. Plus it makes it more difficult to tweak the values as I will have to dig into all of the conditionals for each stage.

Why not simply "Add Lives" to each slot on that team?

Why not simply "Add Lives" to each slot on that team?
I want to keep it a team wide pool, rather than just each slot.
Every time a player's life reaches 0, if there are any spare lives, it grants that player one additional life.

Question:  Can a mission run indefinitely if at the last objective, you just reset all other objectives?  It's a little more complicated than that, I'm just trying to figure out a way to run something that's similar to a headless server, just not quite headless.
Yes you can reset objectives to make a mission run forever. Just be sure that there is always at least one active objective at all times.

somewhere around 24hrs iirc but I could be wrong
oh that's not too bad

Is there a way to check the mission-file for conflicts/errors?  or do i have to remove every single objective/event?
Immediately after attempting to launch the mission, upload your player log.  To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.
Will do that ty ❤️

yes but he fixed that

Still? wadhuheck? will correct that (again)
okay even after saving the 2nd time it would not save removing the unit from echo via group-menue instead of unit-menue worked

Does anybody know maybe why a map won't completely load in? I made a mission in a map, and when I tried to play it after uploading it, it didn't want to load in,  it was loading till the end of the bar but not doing anything after that?
I hope there's something I can do about this instead of having to scrap the mission
@Sypwn

Can you post a `Player.log` of a game session where you try to load the map?
If it has a lot of cities it may hang at the end of the bar for a while
How long would u say is a while?

How long would u say is a while?
Bc it might just be that
The *max* hanging at the end would probably a few minutes

Hey all, anyone know If can create a devcam player profile somehow in the game files without being in VR?   My link cable just died and itll be about a week till I get a replacement.  I need to continue with testing a misiosn Im building
In `AppData\Roaming\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR\SaveData\pilots.cfg` you can modify pilot names
thanks, i needed to know that

i totally forgot, how do i get the player log again?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2. In this menu, paste the following: `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR` 3. A directory should appear. Inside should be a file named "Player.log", or just "Player" if you have file extensions hidden. 4. Upload this file to Discord in the channel you are asked to do so.

does anyone know from how far away can the AWAX pick up enemy targets?
The AWACS radar is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar more powerful than any other radar. But otherwise, no, you can't estimate radar ranges for anything because of how many factors are involved.
oh okay, so there isnt a benchmark i can work with at all?

I'd like to turn it into something like dynlib for some co-op fun
I can walk you through the trigger code, but the hard part is placing every possible unit, and giving them all alt-spawns.

So just making sure, if you host a round and ban someone, your not blocking them just stopping from a rejoin on that one match? Sounds viable with a no late rejoin set as well.
> stopping from a rejoin on that one match On that *one lobby*, so they are gone until you fully rehost the lobby
I kind of feel like they should be forced to killcam watch until everyone dies... lol

Do we know if the dynamic liberation creator is on here?
Yes?
Is there a way to have this 1 life option enabled for one of the modes or should we stick to the host and ban as they die route?

Also, love the work you put into that scenario.
The problem with adding new variations is that it's already a lot of work maintaining 9 versions. If I make the change to one, I have to propagate it to all of them.

Is there no option to set a target's detection mode via event sequence action?
nope
but if its stationary, you can despawn that object and spawn another in its place with a different detection setting

Are they ground units, and are they in a group?
yes and yes
Ground units in a group will ignore default behavior and individual orders. They must be ordered to move as a group using a UnitGroup trigger. Or you can remove them from the group.

just double-checking, does the "player" triggered by option work for all players or just the host?
You mean objectives and triggered events? Those look for any player.
thanks

I want to make a mission where if the player destroy the target spawned in the random location, another new enemy spawns in random location and endlesslyrepeats.   the core part of this mission is spawning the enemy in random location at start, and resetting the mission by spawning it again in another ramdom location after the enemy is destroyed.

but there's an issue with the mission completion. If I assign the objective like this picture abd destroy the enemy, the enemy immediately respawns in the exact same position instead of switching to one of the other alt spawn locations.  Is there a way to make the enemy respawn in other alt spawn positions upon mission reset ?
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#rerollaltspawn>
thank you so much! it did not appear via googling

I have tried that method.  I have added text messages for each conditional action editor ifs, and it randomly displays numbers 1~10 so the RNG is working fine.  However, spawning the enemy in event sequence just ignores force alt spawn and keep spawning in the exact same spot.  I guess it's bugged or the FAQ is outdated ?  Using force alt spawn in trigger works.
Make sure the force alt spawn happens while the unit is dead. You may need to put the spawn action in a separate node after the force alt spawn action.
it did it like this, as FAQ site showed

can you show the contents of the conditional action?
it had the same result when I didn't added messages to see if RND is working.
as I said RND itself is working according to the message.

can you post your player.log after testing it?
Where can I see the log?
To get your player log, follow these steps: 1. Press and hold the Windows key and the R key. A menu should pop up in the bottom left of your screen. 2.

this is the log from the latest test. I think you should mainly look around 'MAD-4 Radar [4] forcing altspawn'

is it really a bug then ?
yeah
got it, at least now I learned the reason. I think I should go for spawning initial random enemies and then replaying the mission, or constantly spawning in the same location.

I wonder how this mission made endless enemy waves.  Since vtol vr don't allow to edit other's missions unlike many other flight sims i'll probably never know.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913955345
Enemies can be respawned. Objectives can be restarted. What part are you confused about?
Spawning enemies randomly among alt spawn points

https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#rerollaltspawn

Only your specific implementation is bugged. I'm looking into why right now. Have you tried it with other types of units? It might be an issue unique to MAD-4 Radars
Then I'll try it again today.
With other units

Is there a document describing the ai behaviour ? Path and parked are self explanatory but I don't know how exactly stayinradius, follow, and railpath works
Nope, sorry
`stayinradius` doesn't seem to work properly when I tested it. The units all piled up in one place. I have no idea how to specify the leader for `follow` `railpath` is deprecated. It was an old workaround an old bug. Don't use it.

I have 2 more questions :  1. Is it possible to display a global value in the tutorial message or anywhere else ?  2. I want to make a smart FARP point to allow rearm and repair the helicopter. There's repair vehicle event but is reloading the weapons not possible ?
> 1. Is it possible to display a global value in the tutorial message or anywhere else ? Nope. Best you can do is create a conditional action that has a condition for every possible value of the GV, and displays a different popup for each one
> 2. I want to make a smart FARP point to allow rearm and repair the helicopter. There's repair vehicle event but is reloading the weapons not possible ? You mean in singleplayer? Have you tried the "reset vehicle" action?

New question : can pick up mission be done by any vehicles or AV-42C only ?
Only AV-42C can pick up infantry. (So far at least. Likely getting a blackhawk someday)
Got it, I wanted to make a pick up mission for dragonfly as well.

infantries not randomly roaming around is pretty fatal to me but OK. is Baha doing something about code optimization ?
AFAIK he's always optimizing code
this game is already impressively optimized for a flight sim, I can't appreciate him enough

Do you mean the "Dynamic Liberation Solo" challenge mission specifically? Or just hosting a private lobby?
just hosting private lobby
my goal is making singleplayer AH-94 dynamic mission / campaign

Is that intended or just bugged ?
Pretty sure it's a bug
And yeah I'd call that one catastrophic. Not sure why he hasn't fixed it.

Does anyone have info on sam launcher ranges?
I know people have spreadsheets for some stats
I have one for radar power, but their launch range apart from a max value is very dependent on the aircraft RCS

yo, for a mission I'm working on there are 4 helos and 2 jet slots for players. I want to make it so two allied ai aircraft will take off and assist helos in place of player jets if no players occupy the 2 MPspawn 'jet' slots. what conditions should I have my triggers check for to see if a player is in a player slot for a jet or not? I know the 'alive' condition will =true for ai units placed in missions but not spawned yet, does it behave differently for players? do they only trigger as alive once a player joins that slot? or is a player technically alive until dead even if not spawned into the world?
Player Alive checks are only true if a player is alive at that moment. They do behave differently from AI alive checks.  But you can't have AI form up on Players in MP.
that's fine, they don't need to form up. just float around the map hunting air targets to take some pressure off the helos when other players in jets aren't around

Oh is there an event to change the amount of fund ? I couldn't find it.
Pretty sure it's under Unit -> MP Spawn -> Add Funds
But it's singleplayer mission.

I’m trying to have unlimited spawns until a missions triggers then set lives to 3. Is this possible? Can’t figure it out
Can global values be transferred to the next mission in campaign ?
No

No, i use that action to broadcast info throughout missions.

Well I've heard of it not firing for everyone in some situations, but I don't think I have a concrete example to investigate.

@Dutchy why did the tutorial message not show for everyone again?
we tested this, and for some it only shows for the host
So if you know of a specific mission where messages only show for certain people, I can look into it.

Having real trouble getting enemy ground units to move. I've tried infantry and the missile truck, I set them to 'path' and the 'defaultpath' is set to a path I made. I've tried making the starting node of the path the exact position of the unit, slightly ahead of the unit, slightly above the unit and same for the second point.   I made a friendly carrier move following a circle with no problems. Is there something different I have to do?
If ground units are in a group, they will ignore default behaviors and individual commands. They must be ordered to move as a group.
I'll try that, thanks

That was it, thanks! If I put them back in a group, how can I set path settings on the group?  Also, is there a way I can 'run' the mission from the editor without launching? It would be good if I could test that they move and see how long they take from the editor.
<https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#testwithoutvr>
Use a trigger action to order the whole group to move.

i have no experience with the mission editor but i kinda feel like trying to make a furball mission when i get home are there choosable levels of AI?
You can choose which aircraft they fly and what weapons they have equipped.
but AI behavior/difficulty is constant?

yes

I'm looking to create a mission that encourages communication between two groups of aircraft. I'm currently thinking of doing this by having an F45 with an A2A loadout, and 1-2 AH94s. The F45 will be performing CAP and marking targets for the AH94(s). I want the AH94(s) to utilize firing from cover, using GPS points provided by the F45. I want being exposed for too long to be a threat for the AH94(s), without making things even more difficult for the F45, and I want the F45 to have a job to do that doesn't require the AH94(s) to engage in A2A combat. Any ideas?
My current ideas are having VTOL bombers take off, attempting to damage a friendly carrier group or something similar. I might add some enemy fighters, but only giving them FOX 2s to make missile evasion easier on the helis.
Make use of the "Gets Detected Now" triggers.  Enemy only has short range detection (SAAW, IRAPC, maybe GAVs?). F-45 have to run slick or stay distant. AH-94 have to stay behind cover, getting GPS targets from F-45s, or using their radar.

1. I start at the bottom of the log and scroll up looking for an Exception. Here we find an `IndexOutOfRangeException` right near the bottom. 2. The text right above the exception usually shows the last thing the game did before the exception occurred. In this case, it was setting up the player spawns and slots. 3. The part here says exactly where in the code the error occurred. In this instance, I'm already aware of a bug in the `GenerateSlotDesignation` function caused by copying an AH-94 slot with 2 seats, then changing it to a different vehicle.
That bug is already fixed in 1.6 btw

In the mission editor how would I detect if someone goes above a certain altitude?
With a condition?
nvm found it

Oh? What's the unit referred as?
disregard, I glanced over it because it's called a "Anti-Air Artillery". The "Artillery" made me think of the usual Howitzer/Mortar definition, i.e ground units vs grounds units
Yeah it's the only AA gun in the game

How far away can a SAAW target an aircraft?
Radar detection ranges vary wildly. They are unpredictable.
I can check the unity for that later.  Since I can inspect all the stats in unity I'd like to contribute on wiki page. The weapons and enemy infos are so lacking.

Is it possible to duplicate a mission you have created in order to make minor edits and make a different version. Example: Made a guns only PvP and I want to make the same thing but guns and heaters?
I dont want to go and place all the same mission assets though
im an idiot lol nvm, there is a save as... option haha

In my mission I want an objective to fail if a unit is detected by radar with manpads along the path. This is not possible is it?
In a future update it would be cool if instead of unit group  > alpha > detected > enemy you could have a list of units to choose from like other variables
I don't understand. Who is detecting who under what conditions?

I don't understand. Who is detecting who under what conditions?
So the objective fails when any mp unit is detected by enemy.  My intention is to only fail when MP unit detected by a radar. I want manpads to spawn along the path so you must kill them without being detected by radar. But obviously the objective fails when the MP unit is detected by the manpads.  So this logic is impossible currently correct?
Set it so when whatever radar sees you, it fails

Edit condition in sequence events?
I don't think this is an option
I meant like entry/exit conditions in sequences

Can you give more detail what you’re trying to do?
But off the top of my head Else/ Else If conditional is probably your best bet. System > system > fire conditional action
Can't select the radar unit and have it say "detects > [player]"?

Can't select the radar unit and have it say "detects > [player]"?
nah
SAM launcher is not the radar

You mean having different spawns?
Yeah,  so imagine an enemy plane takes off flys to a zone and then randomly searches in that zone so flys different patterns and altitudes then when it’s fuel is low it lands refuels takes off again, or a different way if as the player flys into a trigger then it spawns an enemy plane or heli that spawns somewhere in the zone and again searches at different heights and patterns
So is their a way to spawn an enemy at varying attitudes

How to update my uploaded mission ? I'm not sure steam -> upload will update it or just create newer one

How the HELL does StayInRadius work in VTOL?
When I double click the new spawn it jumps to that spot but it’s only 1 unit their not a group , I have checked that I have sync group clicked which is but it still just moves one
You have to move one alt spawn at a time for each unit

@hijong park  Thankyou. With the stay in radius, what do you mean by cirulcar paths?  If I had an enemy heli and wanted it to spawn and randomly fly around how do I do that
Make a path with 4 points, and set path mode to smooth with loop checked. Then enemy will smoothly circle around 4 points
Is there a way to use the AH94 desert camo? I thought it would automatically apply with the biome

Is there a way to use the AH94 desert camo? I thought it would automatically apply with the biome
There's not a way to force it. The "desert camo" is just the REDFOR camo that's applied to everyone on Team B
I suppose if it's multiplayer you could make everyone on Team B

there will be proper skin support

Does sam launchers need to be in the same group with radar to operate or can radar automically help any sam launchers around it ?

Does anyone know that if you use the "fire conditional action" to destroy player vehicle, and then have another event that changes player spawn when they die, will the second event pick the vehicle getting destroyed by command as death or no?

It should be considered 'is not alive'

So my "code" won't work?

@Sypwn how do u make the GAV 25 Bullshark take of vertically?
will the takeoff command in events be enough that it knows todo vertical takeoff or no?
It will always take off vertically, if possible. If the TWR is too low, it will either taxi to a runway (if on airbase), or do nothing (if not on airbase)

i know very little about the mission editor but i made a fleet of 5 in a V. i put them all onto the same path but when i ran it the two cruisers went to the front, then the carriers conglomerated into a true super carrier. any way to fix that?
Did you put them in a group?

No, do I need to make them a group to maintain formation?

Yes, otherwise they won't know who to form up with

Just 1 Im trying to figure out how to spawn an aircraft group after I complete a objective
with out having to make them take off from air strip

My New questions  1. If i destroy av-42c via event, will its  corpse last forever on the map ? I know there's static object for that but static things can't have alt spawns.  2.there is a condition for the units getting detected by ally or enemy which will be useful for making dynamic BGM, that transforms between peaceful and combat BGM. does getting detected event only works once, or work again if the unit got hidden and then detected again later ?
> If i destroy av-42c via event, will its  corpse last forever on the map ? No  > does getting detected event only works once Yes. Once a unit gets detected, it's "Detected" forever
Except players have a special "Gets detected now" condition that only checks if they were detected *this frame.*

Sounds like a better choice for dynamic BGM, thanks.

What would happen if mission bgm event plays while the player mp3 is on, will it just be muted until the player turn off their mp3 streamer ?
dunno
I just know that starting mp3 player will stop BGM

it possible to have radio message play only to a specific mpunit. say if mpunit0 within radius play message but only the mpunit0 pilot and gunner (AH94)?
no
big sad

I think there will be in 1.6
damn, guess my op will have to wait 😭

any way i could cheese something to blow up its radar?
Spawn in an AI with optical AGMs set to only attack that radar
thats the only way?

Is the length of radius in near waypoint or land objective settings measured in meter or nm or anything  else ?
everything in the editor is in meters
or m/s

Setting lives to 0 here grants infinite lives, no?
no, it makes the slot unusable until lives are granted by a trigger
if you want unlimited lives, uncheck the "limited lives" box

One last thing regarding spawns. Allowed slots is how many people can use it as a spawnpoint?
I can't really launch into vr atm so there's no great way for me to test it
allowed slots is only for AH-94, and sets whether it can hold a gunner

yo does anyone know that if i tell an AV-42C to unload passenger's will it wait until it is on the ground?
dunno
alr i guess ill see then lol

should i upload it here?
first, search it yourself for that AV-42C
alr

i see it says something about not having an available parking spot and/or that parking spot not having a runway?

ok, send the log

I want to force GAV-25 Bullshark always fly in hover mode so they would act like a psuedo-enemy attack helicopters.  At which velocity AI aircrafts stay in hover mode?
They don't
They only hover when taking off and landing, and that's done on rails

So I’m a fleet of aircraft, all in the same group, if one is on a path will all be or do I need to set them all to a path?
you need to order **the group** to follow the path using a Unit Group event action
How do I do that?

Thanks

I'm thinking the answer to this question is "no" but does anyone have a reliable method for having the player (or players, in coop) manually signal to the game to continue with events? ie: player needs to signal to av42s to drop their troops, up to player to determine when its clear or not, player needs to signal to the av42s manually to continue  Tried using a strobe light interaction event but that doesnt seem to work in MP
You have to be clever with the tools available. In the case of telling an AV-42 to drop off, you can check if a player is locking it with a TGP.

does any one know how to make custom skins?
Use a program like Blender, Substance Painter, or Quixel Mixer to paint on the provided FBX files. Then export the texture, and import it into VTOL VR using the livery editor in the mission editor's main menu.
ok

in the player's 'Using weapon' property, is weapon safety mode or not arming any weapons considered to be blank or 'NO WEP' ?

You have to extract the game files with AssetRipper, then manually convert the base mission to vts format.

Hello, I am sorry to bother and I bet this gets asked a lot. I just finished my mission, it isn't very big in fact it is very much a small quick mission. This is my first time trying to upload one of my missions to the steam workshop so I have no idea what I am doing. This leads me to my problem. When I try to upload it, all I get is an "ERROR LIMITE EXSEEDED". I have no idea what this means and I've tried to go online to see if someone else had the problem, but no one I could fine had the solution. Now I am here, what does this mean and how can I get passed it?
Is there any way to convert a workshop mission I made back into a mission editor file? I've formatted my hard drive and forgot I had all my mission editor stuff on there

Are you sure all mission and campaign images are `.jpeg`s and are under 1MiB?
You need to convert the image, not just change the extension.
Yeah just checked

is there a way to edit the default missions? I want to change the T-55 BFM mission to have guns only rather than missiles and guns
Not easily. You'd have to use something like AssetRipper and extract the mission files.
why wont these enemies fire their radar missiles until im within 6 miles?

I fixed it. For some reason if the name of the pic was longer than 6 characters it would not work
Try putting force detection. That worked for me.

How many units do you guys usually put in large scale missions ?
Is there a way to define or force a livery for an aircraft in a mission?

For players, yes, unless the lobby host overrides it.

Would making many alt spawn hurt performance much ? I tested my mission myself but it had been running solid
No, more alt spawns shouldn't have an effect on performance. But they do have a significant effect on the size of the vts file
I want more replayability so I have put more click labors

folks..  question re quicksave/ quick load triggers.  Im building a training mission with voice instructions.  Ive set an action to quick save in certain places, and also a trigger action tied to a cockpit button at certain times to quick load last save point  (to alow repeat of the last training section in case someone gets stuck and needs to listen again instructions) But when I test it -  the quick load happens perfectly, but the voice files dont play again... what am I doing wrong?  any tips?    Cheers!

Is it possible to convert an MP mission the SP without having to redo everything?
Yes, by editing the vts manually. But there is no tutorial, you'll have to figure it out. See the question from that FAQ about editing vts files.
Ok thanks

Thnaks. my training mission is a single player quickie already, are suggesting to test with completely new misssion? the other idea was what if I build a new replicated objective  / training section basically same as, that gets triggered instead of a quickload.. long way round, but..

man i should make a mission or two but i really don't want to learn something i may only use for like 2 months a year
When nobody have made a mission you want to play (single player randomized ah94 mission in my case) You are going to make a mission furiously.

yo, does the E-4 not communicate hostile aircraft info if it's set to 'engage enemies=true',  radar on, and it's set to orbit a waypoint? The E-4 in my mission won't broadcast any hostile ship info, even if you request bogie dope it just says 'negative'. which is weird because I don't ever remember having trouble getting the awac broadcast info to allied aircraft before in my previous missions. Is there some known bug regarding getting the awac to communicate or am I missing something I forgot to check?
I haven't messed with awacs much
Create an empty mission with just you, an awacs, and an enemy that spawns in after a few seconds. See if that works.

if i make a mission in the campaign mission editor i can still use it in mp right?
...what?
what is the "campaign mission editor"?

what is the "campaign mission editor"?
there is a mission editor, and a campaign editor
To make a multiplayer mission, you have to create a multiplayer campaign and put the mission in that.

really? i couldn't find the option when i was trying it in the standalone mission editor to set it as multiplayer, and when I googled it it said I had to create a mission in the campaign editor to do so instead
See the first question in the pinned FAQ, lol
ah i think then i misread

is there a reasonable do not exceed number of units for multiplayer?
mulitplayer one was set to av-42 and not f/a-26 so it wouldnt show the level id made
The performance impact is different depending on the types of units: Players > AI aircraft > Moving land/sea units > Stationary units  Dynamic Liberation usually has about 40-80 units active per sector, depending on intensity and dice roll.

Does having a bunch of Units on map but not spawned (not spawned until triggered) impact anything? I want to make a mission where someone can kill a unit at base and it will trigger a set amount of unit on the map. if they shoot a diff unit it spawns that set etc etc. would having all those units "on map" but not spawned in cause any stability issue? Also does the map size Have and impact? or can you go to max size and still be fine.
In my testing, unspawned units don't have any performance impact.
Read your Bio that was my reaction to trigger looping aswell lol

Am I missing a setting or something that allows comms to include it?
Its supposed to fly along a path and then respawn at lest than 5% fuel, rinse and repeat. Thats why there is no RTB

One is a high quality mission, the other is a base game mission

So I'm trying to create a PVP mission. Do I set one base to Enemy, or keep them both as Allied and set teams some other way?
If you dont set one as Enemy, they wont be able to request landings there

What's the "RailPath" mode for ground units?
To make your cursor a specific angle to place units, you can type a new cursor angle in the bottom right corner of the editor. To make things like path nodes, use the Measure tool from one of those drop down menus at the top.

I'm also trying to figure out a way in my scenario to make fighter escorts actually act as escorts only, and not fly completely across the map to engage targets. Any tips for doing so?
Maybe uncheck engage enemies
And set the path

If I force all AI aircraft to be undetected, will that make them essentially only target players?
The detected settings mean the unit will always be visiible in NAV, or not, or only when they are in your line of sight.
Ah

Is it possible to load up any of the official missions in the mission editor? It would be helpful to see how some of those were built/use them as a base for new missions.  Similarly, is it possible to load any of the official maps in the map editor apart from Akutan? I have been really enjoying the t55 border war map.
You have to use AssetRipper to extract the raw files, then manually convert them to vtm, vts, and vtc where appropriate. Others have done it, but there are no tutorials.
Thanks

How can I trigger an event when a player voices a command over radio?
Sadly there's no way to take inputs from the player directly
The most common way is to have them do some obscure thing (like turning on their strobe lights or locking a specific unit with their TGP) in order to trigger an event

allied ground support has reaming stations with assets, or invisible. should be there as well for team B. i assume this is a SP mission?
fair fair

yeah it does
but no, if the game is locked up and won't accept any input then there's nothing you can do

then take screenshots of your unit positions?
Wdym?
you're gonna have to redo your last 2 hours of work

oh you only have mouse control?
you might be able to double click on the ground to teleport the cursor

how do i make it where some enemy air units will fly a path when the players on the other team pass a certain waypoint?
If passing that waypoint is an objective, you can put an action in the objective's complete actions section. If passing that waypoint is not an objective, you can create a triggered event.
yep i just figured out the triggered event, i was trying to do it with the timed event and didnt realize it was a timed event

Whenever I make a mission in a game, I tend to either make it either really easy and noob friendly, or seriously difficult where the average player has a tough time.  Is there any guides / tips on how to make sure a mission is balanced between fairness and difficulty? or can it only be known through making the mission playable?
There's a massive difficulty curve in being able to evade active radar missiles. If the mission has them, it's going to be hard for noobs (unless they throw themselves at the enemy endlessly). If you don't add them, then the mission is usually too easy for skilled players.  You just have to decide who your target audience is.
So is there a way to add a little intro text in the players view when starting a mission?

However, in practice, once the hill was entered and the team score began to increase, leaving the hill did not work properly. I can't really work out why unless trigger events cannot be reused.

Can we please get a PAUSE background music function in the editor? This way we can use a song and pause it at times without restarting the song
for what? I'm trying to think of a need for such a command
I am creating a KOTH gamemode. Prompts pop up when things happen like a team controls the hill, it becomes contested, it is abandoned, etc. I would also like to play different music according to which team holds the hill at that time, however doing this requires that the song restarts everytime it is prompted making it very annoying lol, if it were to resume where it left of I think it would be a bit more palatable

The gamemode functions pretty well as is but this would offer more intel to each team as to who is holding the point if they missed the pop up promt or something

So you really just want it to remember where it left off after switching to a different track and back? That's a more reasonable request to me.
Yes, so instead of a STOP BGM command, i would use a PAUSE BGM command
I search for the Sequence's name in the Log, but it can't find anything related to it.

Ok so I have a fairly complicated game logic going on and I'm having a small issue with one prompt not popping up when it should and another prompt popping up in it's place when that prompt shouldn't. Would someone be willing to watch a quick stream to help me iron this out?
I have been looking through and cannot find the hiccup, it seems as though it should work as I intend but in practice it does not
Did you check your player log?

Did you check your player log?
Idk if that will help, It looks like everything is wired up properly
> Idk if that will help It will tell you exactly what triggers and sequence nodes fired, and which sequence entry/exit conditions are still waiting

Can I make a player spawn point for any aircraft? Or do I have to specify which type
Going back to this for a second, is it better for the Sequence to begin by a Condition or by Trigger? or is there no difference, and this is what makes Timed and trigger Obsolete?
Sequence can handle both timed and triggered events if used correctly so there really is no need for the timed or triggered events

I use nothing but sequence events now

it ahs to be individually? i can't make a group do it?
Group actions only exist for actions that are guaranteed to be available to that whole group. Not all ships are drone launchers, so the "launch drones" action is not available as a group action.
After realizing that 'Stayinradius' behaviour is not randomly roaming around but just moving to X 0 and Y 0 coordiates,  I have devided the map in 9 sectors, made 9 extremely twisted bezier paths, and applied these to those 'random encounter' enemies in each sectors to make random roaming.  Not only it makes pretty good 'roaming around' effect, their constant changes in moving direction makes shooting turrets from over 4 Km away completely waste of ammo which is great.

Hello, I have a question, im trying to make a custom scenario  map to play whit friends, and i cant make the multiplayer plane spawn, i can only have 1 player spawn, is there a mod or another method to fix this?
First question <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ>
oh, thank you

How would I go about Self - destructing drones that were launched from their respective ships after the carriers are destroyed? Like, carrier 1 is destroyed, so carrier 1 drones self destruct.  or is that not possible?
Nope. Launched drones cannot be controlled. Which is why I don't use them.
The one time I did have to use them

can I not, like, use a "kill all" command / event when the carriers die?
dont think so
They don't show up in the selection, because they don't exist in any form until they are launched

which also bring another question, how do I make it so when the carriers spawn in, they don't spawn in their drones?
Hold up, are we talking about drone carrier drones or NFP carrier aircraft?
drone carrier drones

drone carrier drones
that the AI use

So in the event's spawn menu, If i select all enemy's except for the drones, it still spawns them?
the drones don't show up in the System -> Units -> Spawn action list
unless Baha changed it and I missed that

with the multiplayer move spawn event. If its to start immediately, with the entry condition of a MP slot / player not being alive. When the mission starts, and a slot isn't taken up, will it immediately switch spawn points? Or does it only switch if that slot has been taken and has ejected / died at least once?
It will immediately move the spawn point. Even if the players have selected a spot and are spawning in at the start of the mission, it will still move them because of <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#eventatstart>
(You can use that to roll random player spawns for a mission)

So i need to set a timer? So when the timer is done, they will at least be in the air
You should normally attach it to an objective
All present players take off, or form up, or something like that.

Ok, so if I have the Spawn change activating at the beginning of an objective to destroy something, it will then change it? Like this?
I feel like I'm missing context here. Why are you starting another objective as part of the Start Event of an objective?
And what does the "Respawn" event do? Move the player spawns immediately?

If you post screenshots of all relevant events and objectives, that will help a ton

For context, something weird which I've been doing is that whenever an objective starts, it's starting action is to begin itself. (this is prob a waste)  Also, yes, the "respawn" is the spawn change

Right now, the players will spawn with a locked loadout, but when the spawn changes, I want them to be able to change their loadout to their preferences.  is that possible?
you have to make separate slots, and unlock them later using lives
How fast do sea units move?

How fast do sea units move?
Depends on the ship. The wiki should list each one. <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/DMS_Cruiser>
A sea group in formation will move at the speed of its slowest ship.

Is there a way to have it so when a player respawns in a multiplayer mission, they can spawn in a different location?   Like after Obj 1 is done, they spawn in the air closer so they dont have to fly 5 mins to get back to the fight
see pinned FAQ
oh sweet, thx

Add max speed to drone carrier page plz? <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Drone_Carrier>
isnt it the same as the DMS cruiser
so every other ship gets it's speed included but the Drone Carrier. Even the gun boat, rocket boat and mine boat get their own speeds. Why u disrespect Drone carrier 😦 lol

Tips on organizing things in the editor?
when using the Alt Spawn, if you wanted a building and 2 sams and radar to spawn in different locations how do link them so that whole groups spawns in the different spots,? with units you can link the squad but not with buildings and sams etc
Buildings (from the map editor) and static objects cannot change their location through logic.

Also is their a way to spawn enemy ah-94? will they add helis to the enemy and then allow players to jump into the enemy side to attack

But if you're talking about stationary units
have one of them spawn normally with an alt spawn. Put a waypoint at each possible spawn for it, then use a Conditional Action to check where it spawned, and Force Alt Spawn on the other units to match.

could you take a screen shot of the complete process? sorry new to creating missions thanks
It's 4am here and I'm trying to fall asleep.
Start with a sequence where you spawn only the first unit (Unit-1)  Then in the second sequence node, put a condition action. The FAQ explains Conditional Actions in the context of doing something random: <https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Sypwn/Mission_Editor_FAQ#chanceaction> Instead of using Chance conditions, you use Unit-1 Near Waypoint Possible-Location-A/B/C conditions for each if. For the Do Thing action, you have it Force Alt Spawn for all the other units in the group to match Unit-1. Then you   Then in the third sequence node, you spawn all the other units.

im thinking about making an AC7 campaign, but i'm not sure if I'm allowed. does anyone know if that would be against the rules?
Why would that be against the rules?
maybe copyright, but youre not making a game or publishing something on steam for money

you are free to make anything

Is it possible to have it so, if a carrier's random spawn is in a group, it's Sea Group will become that fleets group? So like, if it spawns in the top group, it becomes sea group alpha, but if it spawns in the bottom, it's sea group becomes Bravo?
Are these 2 random spawn areas?
i'm about to set up an alternate spawn point for each

You could have an if-else sequence like so:  RANDOM(50%) - spawn group A Else, RANDOM (100%) - spawn group B

Is there a way to set a group speed for sea units? so they all move at like 15m/s or something?
wait, if a sea group moves as fast as it's slowest ship, then what if every enemy ship in each corner of the map is in the same group?
also, how di I fail a mission if an objective is failed? Does it happen when a required objective is failed?

If the ships are ordered to move with a unitgroup action, they will attempt to form up, then move at the speed of the slowest ship.  If the ships are ordered to move individually, they will move at their own speed.

Is it possible to check if the player has fired countermeasures for a conditional objective?
Not that I can see.
Me neither! Alright, I'll bodge it 🙂 Thanks

is there a way to select multiple units at once and move them or do i have to move them all one at a time?
I'm trying to make a recon mission where the player locks the target spawned in random area and let the artillery units to fire and destroy it.  But since artillery can only be assigned to use in the assigned waypoint instead of specific unit I can't find any simple way to achieve this.
Again, i am a moron.
