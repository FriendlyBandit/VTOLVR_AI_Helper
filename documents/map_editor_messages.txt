That would be fun to fly through
true but
Wait, 16000 what? Feet?
Ahh
I mean you could make it through in less than a minute
if it was at 40k ft you could make it through in less than 30 seconds
I mean feel free to do it, the math says its possible, and iv flown that fast before just not through a bridge
:Agony:
You'll want to have your TSD on your screen at all times btw, all your sensors will display information on the TSD at the same time
VTOL maps are heightmaps, so over-hangs/tunnels can't be done
Akatan is special
Akatan is special
Thats Akatan
As I understand it, much of the game relies on hightmap, so its a shock that Akatan works at all
Yeah lmao
Hightmaps cannot have underpasses/tunnels, you *can* make holes in the terrain tho
:KEKW:
Overhangs arent possible as VTOL uses a highmap for maps
:Think:
Can't you already? Some of the F-45 missions have you in a FOB
I suck at typing so
You can modify a file to get around it
In gameSettings.cfg set `EULA_AGREED = 1`
Does teh green channel on the hight map represent where cities are?
hm yes my favorite vtol vr map
I may have given it an unordered list of verticies
which, might not work the best
well this is closer at least
How does the 0-255 translate to height?
map loading is uh.... complex :Agony:
Looks like 255 = 8km?
nan
This is in a method called `SaveTexture`
Well its in a class called `VTTerrainTextureConverter`
that class isnt going to be saving textures of cats now is it
Anyways that method is unused so :Think:
I saw the 8k number somewhere else as well
nan
maybe 6k?
uh I found a method that really didn't like being decompiled
within the save routine `MoveNext` is very odd
It really is :Agony:
nan
theres goto's and jumps all over this method
yea
but why is ILSpy saying thats whats in this method
also @ierdna100 whats the translation between pixels and meters
iv got map loaded I just need to scale it
mapSize is in km?
8k dosnt really look right
Wum?
Iâ€™m trying to load vtol maps in an external program
So a gray scale value of 255 = 6000m?
:thonkery: fun
and by fun I mean reeeeee why are maps so complex
Some maps don't even have 0-3, some have only the `hight`, looks like each high map equally takes a portion which makes things easeir
wdym?
its still used for rendering the terrain as well
this map *only* has `height.png`
Idk, lemme check some other maps
huh odd
Maybe its used if no other ones are present?
hightMap is always `hight.png` and `splitHeightmaps` is the 0-3 stuff
It also looks like maybe you could have 0 - infinity technically
it will keep fetching maps until they don't exist
kk so `hight` is used unless any numbered exist, which in that case they use the numbered
I still have to figure out how to propperly render the maps but thats progress :stonks:
@nebriv Do you know how to convert the VTOL height maps to points in 3d space? Im trying to render the maps in an external program
As in I want to render a model
Like this
How do I translate from a color value (say, `100` on `height1`) to a hight in meters
yeah I just don't know how to convert 0-1024 to an altitude
Does that 0-1024 translate to the -80 - 6000 value I keep seeing in code?
And whats the translation between mapsize and meters
I know the maps go from size 8 to size 64 whatever that means
whats the equation there :thonkery:
ah I saw that in your project was wondering what the *3 was
I don't think that would work tbh, theres a *lot* of random added stuff, such as text, all those circles are going to raise up the terrain, and brighter green dosn't translate to higher on the map
and there are baked in shadows
ah :risitas:
Ill try it
no nbriv is right there
:risitas:
nan
this would look very interesting in game
yeah lol
im 90% sure they are just layered on top of each other, so you have a 0-1024 height map, ill do some testing later to see if I can confirm that
Its meters right?
-80-6000m
A what?
Good question, I just assumed they were fixed size
what website is that btw i wanna steal their code
ty
ah I was hoping it would have a 3d view
im having some trouble rendering a heightmap in 3d
I need it in threejs
Rumor has it that if you upload a map on tropical baha breaks into your house and wipes your PC
Dunno but this morning I woke up with a terrible headake and my PC was wiped
The wiki owner dosn't want that information on it sadly
Uh
heights are 0-1028 mapped to -80 to +6000
red channel is what is used for heights
One pixel is 153 meters
Yeah im talking about the height0-height3 images, the import has a bit different functionality
You'd expect 10 bits, but it just uses 4 images with 8 bits each that are *added*
so 4 8 bit numbers that are summed
X
Mmmmmm maybe no roads?
The buildings on their own might look good
But the road is too thicc
ppppppicl
196 km x 196 km iirc
>30 or 90m
Isn't vtols best resolotion 153m?
:Think:
why do you need to average 4mil numbers?
Also 10 seconds? Headless client creates a heightmap which involves like 86 mil numbers quicker than that
:Think: mine runs in the browser CPU hardly matters
Ok but still, why average
Put enough bridges over it and you could maybe make a tunnel
Could you provide heights for terrain types at each altitude?
I wanna make HC look good
:justright:
Ty
Im not home
Am ordering sushi
I saw a heli freeflight map that was a massive jumble of city and crazy twisting roads, it was pretty fun
Its just freeflight, so not really a race
Not 153?
We'd have to ask Skumby himself why he left, but he did mention the only reason he stayed in the server was because he was a moderator so I am guessing that has to do with it
There's no such tool I am aware of
If anyone's created one, they've at least not publicized it
The code for that is here https://github.com/nebriv/vtolMapMaker
no idea
well
For freeflight im sure he dosnt care
I can provide the files but its not drag-and-drop
nan
Thats just the map but I figure putting the spawns/carrier is easy enough
We'll you'll need to start with a heightmap
*could* yes, but it sounds hard :risitas:
I thought nebriv did something like that
https://github.com/nebriv/vtolMapMaker
Are you the original author?
I don't actually know if that file is required... anyways you'd need permission from the author
Its possible, but breaks the EULA/is basically bypassing built-in security so Im not doing it/explaining it without the authors approval
But I think the heightmap files on their own is enough if you just copy them over to an existing map
`height.pngb` is only used in the case that there's no `height0-3`
nan
That should be the first layer
But there's 4 height maps so 1024
with a mod called CSA yes, in base game, no
Send me a workshop link
Yes, the map files themselves are just 4 PNGs that make up the height map, and the information about roads/structures is stored in a .vtm file, it uses "ConfigNode"s to store data, its a pretty straight forward format
All static objects are in the vtm file
Cities are stored in the green channel of the heightmaps
Manually placed buildings will be in the vtm, the height of the city is in the heightmap
red is the heightmap channel
blue is unused
Yes
No Akutan is fairly special
It may have a VTM but it won't have the required things to place that runway
Water only exists below the altitude you set for sea-level, you'll just have to make it deep enough
No idea
Other than modifing the map files ðŸ˜„
I don't use the map editor a lot, but I do work with its files alot
so my solution to everything tends to be "modify the files"
Not sure what you mean
Normally just open it up and change whatever I need
For another project I used 0m -> 20m -> 40m -> 1200m, should be roughly acurate, not sure about angle steepness
Im guessing you are asking about the Boreal terrain type?
I looked a bit into trying to get the numbers more precisely but the code is complex and unity dosn't want to work with me so idk
To be fair #modding is more active by a factor of almost 10x
nan
~~some people quite like even the tiniest drop of power~~
I aint do shit I just got tired of having to DM shadow :risitas:
nan
Red Elite has created far larger maps, just loading time and memory requirement goes through the roof
@Red Elite you made like a 300km one right?
Heightmaps are added together, so total resolution for each pixel is 0-1024
wdym standalone heightmap?
Yeah, but its used if there aren't numbered heightmaps
Im not sure why its implemented that way
it led me to this wonderful but of code I had to write for HC
Just be happy `folderPath` is a variable
And do not worry about me passing in `image` as a "string" type :itsfreerealestate:
HC is held together by strings and it shows :defaultdance:
No the game won't delete files
I made this awhile ago https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTOLConfigNodeToJSON, is typescript ofc
I also wrote a C# version
how long does it take to read and write a file thats just a few kb :Think:
Idk how slow python is, but in javascript writing 1000 files (synchronously, 1 by 1) with 1000 lines of text each takes less than half a second
But something like fs ops should all be C calls
Akutan
No
vtol is meters
Well meters with a weird conversion for heightmaps
This is the equation to turn a pixel color into a height in meters `(maxHeight + minHeight) / (numImages * 256) * color - minHeight;`
Where minHeight is 80 and maxHeight is 6000
I mean yeah but the equation works with 80 you just know that means -80 lol
If you are looking at the game code, it'll be in `VTTMapTrees.OnChunckComplete`, but there's no single/simple equation/value for figuring out where a tree will be
noise is involved yeah
Yeah you could extract the entire algorithum and work with it
but it would be mroe work than copying that method to its own project and messing with it
that one function refrences 104 different external values lol
ILSpy or DNSpy
Nah the Assembly-CSharp
Which is in `VTOL VR\VTOLVR_Data\Managed`
15nm is good
not really
it was like one line of code lol
what happens if you just edit the vtm to clip two airfields into each other
